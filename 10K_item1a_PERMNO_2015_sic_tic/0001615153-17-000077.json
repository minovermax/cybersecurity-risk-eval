{"cik": "1615153", "company": "Fenix Parts, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are in breach of certain covenants in our Credit Agreement. Our failure to successfully identify and complete a transaction that improves our liquidity during the forbearance period agreed to by our lenders could materially adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of certain defaults under our Credit Agreement, we lack liquidity that is necessary to sustain our operations as a going concern. In March 2017, we entered into a forbearance agreement with our lenders that provides us with access to liquidity to continue our operations. The forbearance agreement was amended on June 23, 2017 to extend the forbearance period, which had originally expired on May 26, 2017, until August 31, 2017 (unless terminated earlier due to new defaults not anticipated in the forbearance agreement) and to resolve certain new defaults. We have engaged a financial advisor to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives that are intended to improve our liquidity. Unless we have identified and have demonstrated progress satisfactory to our lenders toward the completion of a transaction that could include a business combination, debt and/or equity financing, or a strategic investment into us, after the expiration of the forbearance period, there can be no assurance that our lenders will continue to forbear exercising all remedies available to them under the Credit Agreement, including declaring some or all of the amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay those amounts, nor would we be able to satisfy our significant obligations under contingent consideration agreements related to certain acquired companies, and our lenders could elect to take action resulting in our liquidation. These matters are more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K - \"Liquidity and Financial Condition\" and \u201cAbility to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nWe have limited combined operating history, and there are risks associated with the acquisition of our Subsidiaries that could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe were founded in January 2014, and we combined with each of our Founding Companies simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the sale of the shares in our initial public offering in May 2015. During the second half of 2015, we acquired three additional subsidiaries. While we have operated as a combined business with the Subsidiaries since each of their acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate the operations of our Subsidiaries successfully or to institute the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis, reduce the extraordinary high level of auditing and accounting fees historically incurred, and report the results of operations of the combined entities on a timely basis. In addition, there can be no assurance that our management team will be able to successfully manage the combined entity and effectively implement our operating or growth strategies. Our success will depend on management\u2019s ability to integrate our current Subsidiaries and any companies we may acquire into one organization. Our inability to successfully integrate the companies we have acquired and to coordinate and integrate certain operational, administrative, financial and information technology systems would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our efforts to locate and acquire desirable companies in the business of providing recycled OEM automotive products are not successful or if we are unable to acquire desirable companies on commercially reasonable terms, our growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nOne of our principal growth strategies when Fenix was founded and during 2015 was to increase our revenue through the acquisition of additional businesses within our industry. We do not currently have sufficient liquidity or access to capital to support an acquisition strategy. If liquidity improves and the strategy to acquire additional businesses resumes, we face competition in our pursuit to acquire additional businesses, which limits the number of available companies for sale and may lead to higher acquisition prices. When we identify desirable companies, their owners may not be willing to sell their companies at all or on terms that we have determined to be\ncommercially reasonable. If our efforts to locate and acquire desirable companies are not successful, our growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to acquire additional businesses may require financing that we are unable to obtain or to obtain on acceptable terms.\nThe timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts is directly related to our ability to obtain capital commitments, which cannot be readily predicted at this time. We have used cash and common stock for acquisitions of companies. However, the significant decline in the price of our common stock and the suspension in trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market and eventual delisting may result in the unwillingness of potential acquisition candidates to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses, in which case we may be required to utilize more cash resources. Currently and until the defaults under our Credit Facility (described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) are rectified or waived, there can be no further borrowings under our Credit Facility. Furthermore, even if the defaults are rectified or waived there can be no assurance that we will have available sources of financing to support our acquisition strategy or we will be able to obtain financing if and when it is needed or that it will be available on terms that we deem acceptable. Under our Credit Facility, permitted acquisitions are subject to bank review and our meeting certain financial ratios, after giving effect to such acquisition. Our cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available from bank borrowings are not sufficient for acquisitions, and we need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our Credit Facility, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may be costly and involve further restrictive covenants. Failure to raise capital as needed will have a material adverse impact on our acquisition strategy and on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions or generate sufficient revenues from future acquisitions, which could cause our business to suffer.\nAssuming that we are able to finance an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage such business or successfully integrate such business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. There can be no assurance that the businesses we may acquire will achieve anticipated revenues and earnings. Additionally:\n\u2022the key personnel of an acquired business may decide not to work for us;\n\u2022changes in management at an acquired business may impair its relationships with employees and customers;\n\u2022we may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies among acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;\n\u2022our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and\n\u2022we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.\nSome or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manage our internal growth, the results of our operations will be adversely affected.\nWe will attempt to grow our revenues through internal growth as well as through acquisitions, although we do not currently have sufficient liquidity or access to capital to support an acquisition strategy and, as a result, management has focused over the past year on attempting to grow our revenues and increase cash flow through internal growth and integration of existing operations. There can be no assurance that our systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. Any future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities on management. Furthermore, as we grow, our ability to increase productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel to handle critical tasks within our operations and provide services to our customers and partners. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth efficiently and effectively, or are unable to attract and retain skilled personnel, our growth prospects and thereby our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines, our business could suffer.\nOur business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled, remanufactured and refurbished parts. The number and/or severity of accidents and mechanical failures is influenced by factors including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the occurrence and severity of weather conditions, the congestion of traffic, the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, the effectiveness and extent of adoption of accident avoidance systems in newer vehicles, the reliability of new OEM parts, and the condition of roadways. Increases in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline, as motorists seek alternative transportation options. Mild weather conditions, particularly during winter months, tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents. Additionally, a number of states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving, and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents.\nSystems designed to help drivers avoid accidents, including but not limited to impact warning or avoidance systems, lane and vehicle recognition systems and driverless vehicle guidance systems are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated. To the extent manufacturers install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles, the number and severity of accidents could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon the services of our management team.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers and key employees at the management level. This includes, in part, continuing efforts from many of the executives and managers of the Subsidiaries, whose reputations and client relationships have contributed significantly to the long-term success of those companies. Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with certain of our key executive officers and managers, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or managers, or our failure to attract other executive officers or managers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\nWe face intense competition from local, regional, national and internet-based automotive products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.\nThe recycled vehicle replacement parts and automotive recycling industries are highly competitive and are served by local owner-operated companies, several large regional companies and internet-based parts providers. Additionally, in certain regions of the country where we operate, local automotive recycling companies have formed cooperative inventory sharing programs. We currently participate in certain of these programs, but may elect not to in the future, and as a public company, we sometimes do not qualify to participate in certain inventory sharing programs. One such cooperative disqualified us from participation because our Subsidiaries were no longer independently owned. We could also face additional competition in the future from others entering the market, such as OEMs, insurance companies, new parts producers other than OEMs, sometimes referred to as \"aftermarket\" suppliers, and industry consolidators. Some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise and greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and other resources, longer operating histories, lower cost structures and better key relationships in the insurance and automotive industries. As a result, they may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply, sell their products at lower costs or serve customers we are unable to serve.\nIf we fail to maintain or adequately replace our relationships with auto body shops, insurers and other customers, through which we make a significant portion of our revenue, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nThe majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops, also known as body shops, and mechanical repair shops. Additionally, we indirectly rely on insurance companies to help drive demand, as insurance companies are increasingly influencing repair facilities to use recycled OEM products as a lower cost alternative to new OEM products. We also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers. If we are not able to continue our current or similar arrangements with these body shops, mechanical repair shops, insurers and scrap metal recyclers, the volume of our sales, revenue and profitability will be materially adversely affected.\nAn adverse change in our relationships with auction companies could increase our expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers.\nOur inventory primarily consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the U.S. We do not typically have contracts with these auction companies. A small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the U.S. and Canada. We acquire substantially all of our salvage autos from two of these auction companies. If either of these companies prohibited us from participating in its auctions, began competing with us, or significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. Moreover, we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors, rebuilders, exporters and others.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.\nOur operations, both in the U.S. and Canada, are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe emission and discharge of wastes, chemicals, contaminants and other hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;\n\u2022\nthe exposure to hazardous materials; and\n\u2022\nthe generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, reporting, record-keeping, transportation and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, solid and hazardous wastes, petroleum products and hazardous materials.\nWe are in the process of implementing environmental management systems that are designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements and to address current outstanding environmental and operating permit issues. However, if we violate or fail to comply with these laws or regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nContamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include air, soil, surface water and ground water contamination from the release, storage, transportation, or disposal of motor oil, gasoline, or other petroleum products, antifreeze, transmission fluid, waste solvents, chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury. Contamination can migrate on-site or off-site which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability.\nWe may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. Contamination at properties owned or operated by the Subsidiaries or companies we acquire in the future may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations for the full amount of assessment and remediation-related costs, including those for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, surface water and ground water, building contamination, and impacts to human health, and damages to natural resources. Under certain environmental laws, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, we and our directors and officers could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migrating to or from, the Subsidiaries\u2019 or any newly acquired company\u2019s past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for causing, any such contamination. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Significant capital and operating costs may be incurred at any time to keep our operations in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, or if we violate any of these laws and regulations, it may be necessary to restrict or modify our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of the facilities that we lease is the subject of environmental claims.\nGroundwater and surface water contamination has been detected in the past at the facility in Toronto, Ontario that we leased when we acquired the assets of Goldy Metals Incorporated (\"GMI\"), as a result of historical releases and a petroleum hydrocarbon spill in November 2010. Since November 2010, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment issued a series of regulatory orders under Ontario\u2019s Environmental Protection Act that required the owner of GMI to investigate and remediate all areas that were contaminated by the spill and to take protective and remedial actions related to its property and operations as well as adjacent areas. We believe GMI has been and is taking necessary steps to remediate the surface water and groundwater contamination. Furthermore, we did not assume this liability and GMI, its shareholder and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this contamination. However, as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility, we may become legally responsible for this liability, and we and our directors and officers may be responsible under national and provincial laws and regulations for the assessment, delineation, control, clean-up, remediation, monitoring and verification of, or as a result of, any environmental contamination at that site and any affected off-site areas. The owner of GMI and certain of its affiliates have agreed, pursuant to the Combination Agreements, to continue to be responsible for the costs of an additional storm water management, control and discharge system following the completion of the Combinations. However, there can be no assurance that the owner of GMI or its affiliates will perform their obligations under such agreements and their failure to perform would require us to undertake these environmental obligations.\nThe site and operations in Toronto have been operating since the 1960s. During the last decade, the surrounding parkland and agricultural area, as well as the site itself, have been designated part of a new federal urban park. Accordingly, there has been continual governmental, quasi-governmental, and non-governmental body environmental oversight and intervention, including various enforcement initiatives. We anticipate that this will continue.\nThe Province of Ontario has filed a civil lawsuit against GMI and the owner of the land on which the Toronto, Ontario facility is located claiming damages of Canadian Dollars (\"CAD\") $10.5 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest and court costs, for alleged historical and spill-related contamination as well as for alleged property encroachment damage. The lawsuit is currently in the pre-discovery stage. We did not assume this liability, and GMI, its owner and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain limits as defined in the Combination agreements, for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this liability. However, we may become legally responsible for this liability as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility. We cannot assure you that we will not become responsible for this liability, or that GMI and its owner or their affiliates will have the capacity to indemnify us in the event we become responsible for this liability in whole or in part. We also have been advised by experts retained by or on behalf of GMI, the landowner and us that the amount of damages, if any, are more likely than not to be less than $500,000; however, our responsibility for this liability in amounts exceeding the estimates of our experts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nPrior to our leasing this facility, GMI was also charged by the Province of Ontario for causing or permitting an oil spill in Toronto which allegedly impaired a nearby creek. This matter was settled through a guilty plea on consent, with GMI paying a penalty of CAD $94,000. A future charge and conviction under the same or other environmental statute in Ontario could result in the imposition of a minimum fine of CAD $100,000 per day plus a 25% surcharge, up to a maximum of CAD $10 million. We did not assume this liability, and GMI, its owner and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this liability. However, we may become legally responsible for this liability as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility. We cannot assure you that we will not become responsible for this liability, or that GMI, and its shareholder or their affiliates will have the capacity to indemnify us in the event we become responsible for this liability in whole or in part. Our responsibility for this liability in whole or in significant part could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nGMI is also the subject of further regulatory orders relating to sedimentation monitoring and control in the creek, rehabilitating the creek area that was diverted in 2011 as well as assessing, preventing, treating and controlling off-site groundwater and surface water discharges. To address these orders, GMI intends to implement a new surface water control, management and discharge system, the details of which are in the process of being negotiated.\nThe recent fire at our Toronto, Ontario facility and the delay in the recommencement of operations at the facility as a result of the order from a director of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change to cease operations pending the acceptance of a remediation plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 6, 2017, there was a fire at our facility in Toronto, Ontario where two separate operations are conducted: (i) wrecking, salvaging and processing vehicles and recycling the auto parts, and (ii) selling auto parts to the public (the \u201cself-service operation\u201d). The fire destroyed all of the buildings on the property, although the used vehicles stored on the property were, for the most part, undamaged. Firefighters used water to extinguish the fire, reportedly (per the provincial officer's order discussed below) resulting in water seeping into the ground and surface water runoff onto the adjacent property. An emergency response team was retained to contain the water to keep it from flowing into the ground and a nearby creek. Since then, water and ash resulting from the fire were successfully contained on the premises, the ash has been hauled away, and the water will be removed once we complete testing for contaminants and determine the appropriate means of disposal. We also contracted with a restoration company to oversee the setup of both temporary and permanent structures so that we can recommence operations. We and/or our landlord maintain insurance for property damage and business interruption losses; however, coverage is subject to deductibles, limits and certain exclusions and may not be sufficient to cover all of the losses incurred.\nOn April 10, 2017, while we were engaged in clean-up operations, a provincial officer of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change entered the premises and ordered us to cease the acceptance of new vehicles and all vehicle processing on the property until such time that the officer had accepted a plan to recommence operations in an environmentally safe manner. The order did not affect the self-service operation for vehicles already processed and on the premises. However, if we are unable to accept and process additional vehicles, once the inventory of vehicles on the premises at the time of the fire is sold, we will be unable to replace it with new inventory until such time as we are able to resume full operations. We filed a request for a review and stay of the provincial officer's order (the \u201corder\u201d), which was denied in a ruling on April 27, 2017 by a Director of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the \"Director's ruling\"). The Director's ruling further provided that the Director believed that the site in its current condition had evidence of contamination, but that the Director also believed that actions could be taken to ensure that the site could be operated in an environmentally safe manner. The Director indicated that this was particularly true with respect to the receiving and processing of end-of-life vehicles, and the Director's ruling requested that the plan specifically address such end-of-life vehicle operations. The Director's ruling did not address the self-service operation, other than to note the Director's understanding that it would not be operated until the debris from the fire was cleaned up and the ash and firewater completely managed.\nWe have requested a hearing before the Environmental Review Tribunal with respect to the Director's ruling on the basis, among others, that there was no evidence that the fire and its extinguishment or the resumption of our processing operations in accordance with our\nprior practices would cause us to be out of compliance with any environmental law or create the opportunity for contamination of the environment. Since our leasing of this facility in 2015, our operations prior to the fire had never been cited for any non-compliance with applicable environmental laws, although certain storm water issues that arose prior to our leasing of the site remain unresolved. For additional information on these storm water issues, see the Risk Factor immediately above entitled, \"One of the facilities that we lease is the subject of environmental claims.\"\nWe believe that the Director's ruling is premature and therefore without merit, as we intend to comply with applicable environmental laws and rules in the rebuilding of the facility and future operations; however, we may be unable to successfully appeal the order. The potential delay and uncertain timing as to our recommencement of operations at the facility necessitated by the requirement to obtain prior approval of a plan to do so, the possibility that the Director may impose costly remediation measures upon us or may never approve a plan, and the possible incurrence of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and environmental and other permits.\nOur current Subsidiaries and future subsidiaries must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations, including but not limited to permits required by environmental laws. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental and other laws in connection with our facilities. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with any permits required by environmental or other laws, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, when we develop or acquire a new facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government and satisfy applicable siting laws and regulations. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of an automotive recycling facility in their communities. There can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits we and our Subsidiaries currently hold.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill as a result of the acquisitions of our Subsidiaries, which was impaired and may become further impaired, in which case our earnings would be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recorded goodwill of $37.0 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we pay for our acquisitions over the fair value of the acquired net assets. We do not amortize acquired goodwill but instead we test it for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2015, updated the test as of December 31, 2015, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed at either date.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, our stock price declined 32% from $6.79/share at December 31, 2015 to $4.60/share at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, using the methodology and assumptions explained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management calculated a goodwill impairment of $45.3 million that was recorded in March 2016 and is reflected in the accompanying consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTesting for impairment of goodwill involves an estimation of the fair value of our net assets and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and the amount of expected future net cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of our single reporting unit and other key variables. In addition, there are two generally accepted valuation methodologies and the weighting given to each is dependent upon management's assessment of current circumstances which can change from period to period. As a result of the quantitative analyses performed at October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, it was calculated that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no further impairments were recorded in 2016. However, such excess of estimated fair value over book value was only 7% at December 31, 2016.\nThere are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of our Company to fall below its book value carrying amount, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, (i) significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and/or reductions in estimated future sales growth rates, (ii) further reduction in scrap prices, (iii) further reduction in the Canadian exchange rate, (iv) an increase in our weighted average cost of capital, (v) significant increases in our vehicle procurement costs, (vi) significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business, (vii) variation in vehicle accident rates or other significant negative industry trends, (viii) changes in state or federal laws, (ix) a significant economic downturn, (x) our inability to successfully complete our ongoing process to explore and ultimately consummate a strategic and /or financial transaction that will provide us with improved liquidity and maximize shareholder value, or (xi) changes in other variables that can materially impact our business. If we have any additional significant impairment to our goodwill, it would have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the non-cash charge is taken. For further information\nregarding the impairment testing done in 2015 and 2016, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.\nOur revenue, cost of salvage vehicles and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and on a consolidated basis have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Future factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe availability to procure salvage vehicles at an attractive price;\n\u2022\nvariations in vehicle accident rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate in a timely manner and manage our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nseverity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\ndeclines in asset values, including but not limited to goodwill impairment.\n\u2022\ndeclines in scrap metal prices\n\u2022\nincreases in financing costs due to our current financial condition; and\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of the Canadian Dollar relative to the US dollar.\nDue to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nFluctuations in the prices of metals could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operations generate scrap metal. After we dismantle a salvage vehicle for parts and after vehicles have been used in our self-service business, any remaining metal is sold to processors and brokers of metal and the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors. In addition, we receive vehicles from various sources, which we sell at scrap metal market rates calculated on a per-ton basis. The price of scrap metal has historically fluctuated, sometimes significantly, due to market factors. In addition, buyers may stop purchasing metal entirely due to excess supply. To the extent that the price of metal or the demand for scrap metal decreases materially, our revenue from such sales will be adversely impacted and a write-down of our inventory value could be required. Despite our recent experience with declining purchase prices on vehicles as a result of reduced commodity prices, there can be no assurance that our vehicle purchasing costs will continue to decrease by a corresponding amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal prices decline, and there may be a delay between the scrap metal price reductions and any vehicle purchasing cost reductions.\nWe operate in Canada, which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks.\nWe have operations in Canada. Our Canadian operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business, which has had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We collect revenues and incur costs at our Canadian operations in Canadian dollars. The significant decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar from 2014 to 2015 has had an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition in 2016 and 2015, and could have a similar effect in the future. In addition to foreign exchange exposure, we are subject to foreign tax, foreign employment laws and regulations and other foreign and domestic laws.\nIf we experience problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate a fleet of trucks throughout our network to deliver products to our customers and transfer hubs. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel, and liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance. In addition, our failure to deliver parts\nin a timely and accurate manner could harm our customer relationships and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology for significant aspects of our business, including our financial reporting, accounting, accounts payable, payroll, procurement, inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis, vehicle tracking and profitability reporting, as well as an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitating brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock. Any disruption relating to our information systems and hardware could seriously harm our operations.\nWe may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled automotive products.\nSome jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled automotive products that we provide, such as airbags. Additional jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit additional automotive products we sell. Restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Financial Structure\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with an SEC inquiry, and an unfavorable outcome could damage our business and reputation and result in claims or additional proceedings against us.\nIn September 2016, we received a subpoena from the Chicago Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") requiring the production of various documents, which were all provided during December 2016 and January 2017. The SEC inquiry appears to be focused on our change in our independent registered public accounting firm, our previously announced business combinations and related goodwill impairment charge, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our inventory valuation methodology. We have incurred substantial legal fees and other costs associated with production of the documents required by the SEC and may incur further costs before this inquiry is concluded. We cannot predict the duration or outcome of the inquiry, and an unfavorable outcome could damage our business and reputation and result in claims or additional proceedings against us.\nOur stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange, which can adversely affect the liquidity of our stock and its price.\nTrading in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was suspended on June 29, 2017, and Nasdaq will complete the delisting of our common stock after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The suspension was due to our continuing non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) and, in particular, our failure to file the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report\") by its due date (as extended by Nasdaq). Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. (also known as the \"Pink Sheets\").\nOur suspension from Nasdaq has caused negative publicity and a decrease in our stock price. Trading on the Pink Sheets, instead of being listed on a national securities exchange, may cause our stock price to continue to decline or fluctuate and trading volume to decline over time (notwithstanding the increase in trading volume since the announcement of the suspension). Many institutional investors have internal policies that prohibit the purchase or maintenance of positions in stocks that trade in the Pink Sheets. These policies likely caused the sale by certain of our institutional investors of their shares of our stock and will further limit the market for our shares in the future. A limited public market for our common shares may limit the ability of investors to sell their shares and negatively impact our ability to raise capital. Additionally, stocks that trade in the Pink Sheets cannot be purchased with margin loans, which may make our stock less attractive to investors. A company trading in the Pink Sheets cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or \"blue sky\" laws, which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances, including pursuant to employee stock purchase or option plans and private or public offerings of securities. Trading in our stock also may be subject to the \"penny stock\" rules of the SEC, which would adversely impact liquidity.\nOur stock price has declined significantly and could continue to be volatile, which has exposed us, and could continue to expose us, to securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation.\nThe price of our common stock has declined significantly, likely due in part to the suspension from trading and eventual delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market of our common stock, our late filings of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and this Form 10-K, our breach of certain loan covenants in our Credit Facility, the ongoing SEC inquiry, and the operating losses reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are discussed in other risk factors above. There also may be volatility due to perceived uncertainties about our future as we consider strategic alternatives, as discussed in a risk factor above. This volatility may persist or increase if a decision to pursue a particular alternative is announced or if we are unable to complete a transaction to increase our liquidity.\nIn addition to these specific factors, the price of our common stock, in general, could be extremely volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following other factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022announcements of developments affecting our business or expansion plans by us or others; and\n\u2022conditions and trends in the auto parts industry and the economy as a whole.\nStock market volatility also has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, the market price for our common stock has been in the past, and in the future may be, adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers, analysts or others regarding our business model, our management or our financial accounting.\nIn the past, securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Two lawsuits, Beezley v. Fenix Parts, Inc. et al, and Melanie Weiss, derivatively on behalf of Fenix Parts, Inc. v. Kent Robertson, et al, and Fenix Parts, Inc. were filed against us during 2017, as discussed in greater detail below.\nWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit and certain of our officers and our directors have been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that could divert management's time and attention from our business and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn January 2017, a class action lawsuit entitled Beezley v. Fenix Parts, Inc. et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against us, Kent Robertson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Pettit, our Chief Financial Officer. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of our shares from May 14, 2015 through October 12, 2016. The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws. For additional information with regard to allegations in the complaint, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\nIn July 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, entitled Melanie Weiss, derivatively on behalf of Fenix Parts, Inc. v. Kent Robertson, et al, and Fenix Parts, Inc., was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division, against Messrs. Robertson and Pettit and the members of our board of directors. The complaint alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement. For additional information with regard to allegations in the complaint, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The plaintiff seeks relief which includes unspecified damages and restitution from the individual defendants, an order requiring actions to be taken to improve corporate governance and internal procedures, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\nIn the case of both the Beezley and Weiss lawsuits, we believe that the allegations contained in the complaints are without merit and, in conjunction with our insurance carrier, intend to vigorously defend against all claims asserted therein. Nonetheless, the lawsuits may result in costly and protracted litigation, which may require a significant commitment of our resources and time. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and the outcome of these matters, whether favorable or unfavorable, could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness to bank lenders and former owners of acquired Subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to execute our business strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $21.5 million of debt outstanding under the Credit Facility, consisting of $12.8 million under our revolving line of credit and $8.7 million under our term loan. We also have a letter of credit for $6.4 million secured under the facility. In addition, we have contingent consideration arrangements with the former owners of three acquired businesses that could result in substantial future cash obligations in 2017 as described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and as estimated and recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Credit Facility contains operating restrictions and financial covenants that can restrict our business and limit our access to additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2016, for reasons described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we were in breach of certain financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as well as the requirements for repaying over-advances and timely delivery of certain quarterly certificates and reports. As a result, all\nof the Credit Facility debt is reported in the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability at December 31, 2016, and there can be no further borrowings of any availability under the Credit Facility until such defaults are rectified or waived. On March 27, 2017, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement to the Credit Facility (the \"Forbearance Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, the banks have agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the Credit Facility with respect to the above described defaults and any similar defaults during the forbearance period, provided no other defaults occur. The Forbearance Agreement was amended on June 23, 2017 to extend the forbearance period, which had originally expired on May 26, 2017, until August 31, 2017 and to resolve certain new defaults. Our significant amount of debt, limited borrowing capacity and our debt service and contingent consideration obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business, execute our expansion strategy and impair our competitive position. Moreover, even if our current defaults are rectified or waived, any new failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our Credit Facility (other than those anticipated and enumerated in the Forbearance Agreement, as amended) could result in a future event of default, which would permit our lender to call for the immediate repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility, among other remedies. If this happens, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to pay the outstanding Credit Facility debt. In addition, we have significant obligations under contingent consideration agreements related to certain acquired companies as described in Note 6, and we would need access to additional credit to be able to satisfy these obligations. The acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or the failure to ultimately satisfy our contingent consideration obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have assumed uncertain tax positions as part of the acquisitions of the Subsidiaries.\nWe assumed the uncertain tax positions of certain acquired Subsidiaries and have recorded reserves for these positions, including related interest and penalties, of approximately $2.2 million as of December 31, 2016. If the settlement of any unrecognized tax reserves is different than that accrued, it would impact our effective tax rate. Under certain conditions, payments made by us, including interest and penalties, for assumed uncertain tax positions are indemnified by the previous owners of the Subsidiaries for a period of three years from the dates of acquisition and we have an indemnification receivable of $2.0 million recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If a reserved uncertain tax position results in an actual liability and we are unable to collect on or enforce the related indemnification provision or if the actual liability occurs after the applicable three-year indemnity period has expired, there could be a material charge to our consolidated financial results and reduction of cash resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price.\nWe and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity, debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity (collectively, \"securities\") in the future. We may also issue shares of common stock under our stock plan or in connection with future acquisitions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), the issuance of debt securities, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, may cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur officers and directors and the stockholders and former equity interest holders of the Subsidiaries and their affiliates exercise significant influence over us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our executive officers and directors and the stockholders and former equity interest holders of the Subsidiaries and their immediate family members beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. These stockholders may have interests that are different from yours.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and our loan documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they, among other things:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 100,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish supermajority voting requirements in order to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to the Delaware anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on this provision to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. In addition, our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default, which could impede an acquisition, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. We cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nOur internal control over financial reporting, and , as a result, our disclosure controls and procedures, have been determined to not be effective, and we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and as a result our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of material weaknesses attributable to (A) our lack during 2016 of (i) accounting personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience, and training commensurate with our complex accounting issues and financial reporting requirements, (ii) adequate procedures to prepare, document and review areas of significant judgments and accounting estimates, including purchase accounting, contingent consideration, potential goodwill impairment and inventory valuation, (iii) timely and systematic review by management of account reconciliations, journal entries and other analyses to appropriately document and support the recording of financial information, (iv) thorough review of significant contracts for key accounting ramifications, (v) documentation retention to support the amounts reported and (vi) segregation of duties over journal entries as well as (B) undue reliance on the findings and conclusions of third-party specialists without an appropriate level of internal review, and (C) inadequate Information Technology General Controls, including limited segregation of duties and access rights controls over information systems at Subsidiaries without compensating corporate procedures and controls. Certain of these weaknesses were previously described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on April 14, 2016. Our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses are still in progress and may require substantial resources at significant cost over an extended period of time to complete. More generally, ensuring that we have adequate internal financial, accounting and disclosure controls in place requires a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, our actual and/or perceived ability to timely and accurately report on our financial results on a timely basis and meet our SEC reporting obligations could continue to be adversely affected. That could result in additional loss of confidence in our Company, and the price of our common stock could further decline.\nWhen we cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" as defined under the JOBS Act, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If our auditors are then unable to express an opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective there could be an additional adverse impact on trading in our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company have increasingly strained our resources, increased our costs and distracted management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and (if we are relisted on a national stock exchange) the requirements of the stock exchange where our shares may be listed, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of the time of our board of directors and management and results in significant costs and expenses, which will increase after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Among the actions we have taken or are in the process of taking are to:\n\u2022\ninstitute comprehensive corporate governance and compliance functions;\n\u2022\ndesign, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\ncomply with rules promulgated by the NASDAQ Global Market;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain outside counsel and accountants in connection with these activities; and\n\u2022\nestablish an investor relations function.\nDue to the historic decentralized cash basis financial reporting at the Subsidiaries, complex accounting required by the acquisitions of Subsidiaries and our historic lack of effective controls over financial reporting, we have incurred accounting and auditing fees that are extraordinarily high for a public company of our size. In addition, these complexities have resulted in our inability to file our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a Form 10-K in a timely manner, which resulted in the suspension from trading (and will result in the eventual delisting) from the Nasdaq Global Market of our common stock. Please see the description elsewhere in these risk factors of our delinquencies in filing our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and this Form 10-K. We have also incurred in the past and continue to incur considerable legal fees in connection with various matters described elsewhere in these risk factors. Total outside service and professional fees of almost $16 million have been incurred over the past two fiscal years while total revenues have been approximately $200 million over this period. Continued high legal, accounting and auditing costs of this magnitude are not sustainable and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and continued late filing of routine securities filings could undermine investors\u2019 confidence in our Company.\nWe are an emerging growth company and our reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, but are not applicable to emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are not required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have taken advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. Investors may find our common stock less attractive when we rely on these exemptions and relief. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15372, "SIC": 5010, "TIC": "FENX"}
