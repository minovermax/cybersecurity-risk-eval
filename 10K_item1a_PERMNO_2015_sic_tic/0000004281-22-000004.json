{"cik": "4281", "company": "Howmet Aerospace Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nHowmet\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Howmet or that Howmet currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the Company materially in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows have been and could continue to be adversely impacted materially by the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affecting the global community has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, and the nature and extent of the impact over time remain highly uncertain. The impact over time will depend on future developments that are beyond our control, including the duration of the pandemic, the continued severity of the virus, resurgences and emergence of variants of the virus, the efficacy and availability or uptake of vaccines and related drugs, and the actions that may be taken in response to COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates, manufacturing restrictions, labor policies, and travel limitations. The longer the pandemic\u2019s duration, the greater the potential impact on our business and the more heightened the risk of a continuing material adverse effect on our company, business strategies and initiatives.\n\u2022Business and operations risks: We continue to monitor COVID-19 guidance and requirements, to determine whether we will need to modify our business practices or take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our stakeholders, including our continuing focus on the safety and protection of our workforce. If there are restrictions on or disruptions to our business practices, we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our operational costs may increase. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased operational challenges, which have included, and may in the future include, manufacturing site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. We may also face challenges in restoring our production levels if and when COVID-19 abates if we are unable to reinstate our workforce at the levels needed or if our suppliers experience disruptions that impact their ability to provide goods or services to us. As a result of COVID-19 and its negative impact on the aerospace and commercial transportation markets, the possibility exists that a corresponding sustained impact to our operations, financial results and market capitalization may require material impairments of our assets, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other intangible assets, long-lived assets, and right-of-use assets.\n\u2022Customer risks: We have limited visibility into future demand due to the disruptions resulting from COVID-19. The significant decrease in air travel, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain its spread, has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, airlines and aircraft manufacturers and their respective demand for our and our customers\u2019 products and services. Aircraft manufacturers have reduced, and may continue to reduce, production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and, as a result, demand for products in the OEM market has significantly decreased. Several of our aerospace customers previously suspended operations at certain production sites, reduced operations and production rates, and/or took cost-cutting actions, including, but not limited to, General Electric Company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation and The Boeing Company, which represented approximately 13%, 9%, and 5%, respectively, of our third-party sales in 2021. Due to reduced air traffic and flight cycles, spares and aftermarket demand has declined and could remain low until air travel levels return. The decrease in domestic and international air travel due to the pandemic has adversely affected demand for narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, respectively. While domestic air travel has increased during the second half of 2021, international travel has not yet begun to recover and the commercial wide-body aircraft market may take longer to recover. In addition, several of our commercial transportation customers have encountered, and may continue to encounter, challenges in their ability to increase production rates to meet demand due to supply chain constraints stemming from the pandemic. Due to the foregoing factors and other cost-cutting measures by our customers, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations, including the ability to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations and our ability to obtain new customers. Ultimately, the demand for our products is driven by the demand for transportation and travel within and between various countries.\n\u2022Market, liquidity and credit risks: Financial market dynamics and volatility due to COVID-19 could pose heightened risks to our liquidity, including those discussed below in \u201c-Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a prolonged period, it could adversely affect our financial condition, including with respect to satisfying both required and voluntary pension funding requirements, could result in potential increases in\nnet debt or reductions in EBITDA, and could otherwise negatively affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. If the foregoing or other factors negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), our ability to draw under the Credit Agreement would be adversely affected. Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding or our ability to refinance certain portions of our indebtedness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein, including, but not limited to, risks related to global economic conditions, competition, loss of customers, costs of supplies, supply chain disruptions, manufacturing difficulties and disruptions, investment returns, our credit profile, our credit ratings, and interest rates. We expect that the longer the period of disruption from COVID-19 continues, the more material the adverse impact will be on our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe markets for Howmet\u2019s products are cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.\nHowmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries, and the demand for our products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond our control. In particular, Howmet derives a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which is cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors. The defense aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global geopolitical environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older military aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines and airframes. Further, the demand for Howmet\u2019s commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation manufacturers. Commercial transportation sales and production are affected by many factors, including the age of the vehicle fleet, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, and levels of competition. Howmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government actions. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA material disruption of, or manufacturing difficulties at, Howmet\u2019s manufacturing operations could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business.\nIf Howmet\u2019s operations, particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted, including because of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, labor shortages or other reasons, Howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to, or demand from, its customers. In addition, the manufacture of many of Howmet\u2019s products is a complex process. Manufacturing problems arising from equipment failure or malfunction, inadvertent failure to follow regulatory or customer specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, and problems with raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance requirements, which may result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, adversely impacting product demand and customer relationships. Interruptions in production capability could increase Howmet\u2019s costs and reduce its sales, including causing the Company to incur costs for premium freight, make substantial capital expenditures, or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fulfill customer orders. Additionally, a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer. Furthermore, product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure in addition to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because of approval, license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, sources of alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to Howmet or its customers.\nHowmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services essential to our operations, including raw materials, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHowmet has supply arrangements with suppliers for various materials and services, including raw materials. We maintain annual or long-term contracts for a majority of our supply requirements, and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, or obtain replacements for, any of our long-term contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. Supply constraints could impact our production or\nforce us to purchase materials and other supplies from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or on terms that are favorable to us. Howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Howmet\u2019s products may be influenced by private or government entities, including as a result of changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, and unstable governments in exporting nations. Any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyberattacks, transportation, delivery or logistics challenges, weather, natural disaster, or pandemic events could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nHowmet\u2019s business could be adversely affected by increases in raw material, manufacturing and operating costs due to inflation and other market forces or governmental constraints.\nHowmet may be adversely affected by raw material, freight, energy, labor and other manufacturing and operating cost increases. The costs of certain raw materials (including, but not limited to, nickel, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, and rhenium) necessary for the manufacture of Howmet\u2019s products and other manufacturing and operating costs may be influenced by inflation, market forces of supply and demand, shortages, export limits, sanctions, new or increased import duties, and countervailing or anti-dumping duties. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers through contractual agreements in the form of price increases, there can be a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. If the Company is unable to offset significant cost increases through customer price increases, productivity improvements, cost reduction or other programs, Howmet\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nHowmet\u2019s business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully meet increased program demand, production targets and commitments.\nHowmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs. Many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years. If Howmet fails to meet production targets and commitments, or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition. Similarly, to the extent demand for our products increases rapidly and significantly in future periods, whether as a result of general market conditions, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may not be able to ramp up production quickly enough to meet the demand. We may also face difficulties in competing for and recruiting qualified employees. These difficulties could result in significant delivery delays that could damage Howmet\u2019s reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.\nFailure to attract and retain a skilled global workforce or to provide adequate succession planning for key personnel could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s operations and competitiveness.\nHowmet\u2019s global operations require skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience. Shortages in certain skills, in areas such as engineering, manufacturing and technology, and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, labor inflation, or increase in general labor costs, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to higher labor, recruiting or training costs to attract and retain personnel. In addition, the Company\u2019s headcount reductions to align our operations with reduced demand due to COVID-19 could make it difficult to refill the eliminated positions as business recovers. If the Company fails to attract, develop and retain a global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business, our operations could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company\u2019s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management could significantly harm Howmet\u2019s business, and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the Company\u2019s institutional knowledge base, result in loss of technical or other expertise, delay or impede the execution of the Company\u2019s business plans and erode Howmet\u2019s competitiveness.\nHowmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers.\nHowmet has long-term contracts with a significant number of its customers, some of which are subject to renewal, renegotiation or re-pricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions. Howmet\u2019s failure to successfully renew, renegotiate or favorably re-price such agreements, or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships, could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue. Additionally, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by Howmet could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s financial results. Howmet\u2019s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. For example, our sales could continue to\nbe negatively affected by the residual impacts of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding in 2019, as well as Boeing\u2019s pause in deliveries of its 787 aircraft since May 2021 that has resulted in Boeing\u2019s significantly reduced 787 production rates. Howmet\u2019s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Howmet, including to reduce the amount of Howmet\u2019s products they purchase, to switch to alternative suppliers, or to enter into the markets themselves to compete with Howmet. If Howmet\u2019s customers reduce, terminate or delay purchases from Howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and Howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nHowmet\u2019s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft. Although many of the military programs in which Howmet participates extend several years, changes in military strategy, policy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Howmet\u2019s products, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures, cyberattacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Howmet\u2019s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences having a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nHowmet\u2019s information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages; computer network and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism; and usage errors by employees. If Howmet\u2019s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material disruption in the Company\u2019s information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. The Company believes that it faces threats of cyberattacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations, and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Although past attacks have not resulted in known losses of any critical data or had a material impact on Howmet\u2019s financial condition or results of operations, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use the Company\u2019s systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, block access to its systems, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Howmet\u2019s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nHowmet faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.\nAs discussed in \u201cCompetitive Conditions\u201d in Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this report, the markets for Howmet\u2019s products are highly competitive. Howmet\u2019s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in our product markets, which could include existing customers. New entrants in our markets, new product offerings, new and/or emerging technologies in the marketplace, or new facilities may compete with or replace Howmet products. The willingness of customers to accept alternate solutions for the products sold by Howmet, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Howmet\u2019s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Howmet\u2019s competitors or customers could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, Howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. As companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions, companies could be acquired or merged. Companies that are strategic partners in some areas of Howmet\u2019s business may acquire or form alliances with Howmet\u2019s competitors, thereby reducing their business with Howmet. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. Consolidation within Howmet\u2019s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s profitability. Consolidation within Howmet\u2019s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for Howmet\u2019s products if a combined entity replaces Howmet\u2019s products with those of Howmet\u2019s competitors with which it has prior relationships. The result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nHowmet\u2019s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to develop and innovate products, deploy technology initiatives and implement advanced manufacturing technologies. While Howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or achieve and maintain technological advantages.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nA decline in Howmet\u2019s financial performance or outlook could negatively impact its credit profile, its access to capital markets and its borrowing costs.\nA decline in the Company\u2019s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company\u2019s financial metrics or a contraction in the Company\u2019s liquidity, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s credit ratings and its access to the capital or credit markets on terms and conditions that the Company finds acceptable. A downgrade of Howmet\u2019s credit ratings could result in negative consequences, including limiting its ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms, if at all, increasing borrowing costs and credit facility fees, triggering collateral postings, and adversely affecting the market price of Howmet securities. For information on our credit ratings, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Part II, Item 7 (Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Limitations on Howmet\u2019s ability to access global capital markets, a reduction in Howmet\u2019s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Howmet\u2019s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nHowmet\u2019s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.\nHowmet may require substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation may negatively impact Howmet\u2019s ability to fund its planned sustaining and return-seeking capital projects, which could adversely affect the long-term value of the Company\u2019s business and its competitiveness.\nAn adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nHowmet\u2019s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, by reductions in the fair value of plan assets and by other factors. Howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders\u2019 equity. For a discussion regarding how Howmet\u2019s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d in Part II, Item 7 (Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nAdverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company\u2019s liabilities related to such plans. Additionally, unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could lead to a decline in the plans\u2019 funded status and result in higher than expected pension contributions. The foregoing factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nDividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors, depend on a number of factors, and are subject to limits under the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement.\nShare repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Board\u2019s decision regarding such matters depends on many factors, including Howmet\u2019s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company\u2019s debt obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, during the year ending December 31, 2022 (unless the Company ends this period earlier in accordance with the agreement or otherwise), common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings are outstanding under the Credit Agreement and are limited to an aggregate amount of $500 million. The Company previously suspended dividends in April 2020 to preserve cash and provide flexibility in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed dividend payments in the third quarter of 2021. There can be no assurance that the Company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nProduct liability, product safety, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims and investigations may materially affect Howmet\u2019s financial condition and damage its reputation.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products expose Howmet to potential product liability, personal injury, property damage and related claims. In the event that a Howmet product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Howmet may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, or may participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if a Howmet product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, Howmet\u2019s sales could decrease, its reputation could be adversely impacted and Howmet could be exposed to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could also have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or profitability; result in substantial monetary damages and/or non-monetary penalties; result in loss of customers; and require changes to our products or business operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from sales to U.S. and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. New laws and regulations or changes to existing ones (including, but not limited to, those related to subcontracting, cybersecurity and specialty metals) can increase our risks and/or costs. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nHowmet\u2019s global operations expose Howmet to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.\nHowmet has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. As a result, Howmet\u2019s global operations are affected by economic, political, legal (such as laws regulating international trade), and other conditions in the United States and foreign countries in which Howmet does business, including (i) economic and commercial instability risks, including changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings; (ii) geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements; (iii) war, terrorist activities, kidnapping of personnel or other dangerous conditions; (iv) compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust and competition regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and corruption laws, and laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control; (v) aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by foreign governmental authorities; (vi) exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates; and (vii) imposition of currency controls. Howmet faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls in certain countries in which it operates, including China. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by Howmet\u2019s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. Should the Company need to fund its operations using cash from countries where there are restrictions or controls in place, it may be unable to do so on a timely basis and/or without incurring substantial costs. Although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nHowmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business and competitive position.\nHowmet owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company\u2019s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Howmet\u2019s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Howmet\u2019s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Howmet\u2019s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Howmet owns or licenses. Despite its controls and safeguards, Howmet\u2019s technology may be misappropriated by its employees, its competitors or other third parties. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against\nHowmet relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce Howmet\u2019s rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business and competitive position.\nHowmet may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.\nHowmet is also subject to a variety of global legal and regulatory compliance risks in connection with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims or compliance issues, including those relating to securities laws, intellectual property rights, insurance, commercial matters, antitrust and competition, human rights, third-party relationships, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. Howmet could be subject to fines, penalties, damages or suspension, or debarment from government contracts. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period, and could require substantial attention from management and result in significant legal expenses. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nUnanticipated changes in Howmet\u2019s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Howmet\u2019s future profitability.\nHowmet is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Company\u2019s tax expense and profitability. Howmet\u2019s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company\u2019s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.\nHowmet is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018 and was recently updated, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation.\nLabor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of Howmet\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see \u201cEmployees\u201d in Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this report. Howmet may not be able to renegotiate satisfactorily collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Howmet\u2019s facilities in the future. Howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business results.\nHowmet is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and recordkeeping), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Class action lawsuits can result from alleged violations of state employment laws. Allegations that Howmet has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages\npayable to former employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Howmet\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nHowmet is exposed to environmental, health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities.\nHowmet\u2019s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, as well as participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, and internal voluntary programs, have been, and in the future could be, significant. Environmental matters for which Howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates, at sites that it may acquire in the future, or at third-party sites used by Howmet, its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may impact Howmet\u2019s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period.\nIn addition, the industrial activities conducted at Howmet\u2019s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees or third parties that may be on site. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies in the United States and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Material liabilities relating to injury, death or other workers\u2019 compensation claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity and/or significant reputational harm.\nHowmet may be affected by global climate change or by legal and regulatory responses to such change.\nIncreased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems, additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases, and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards in the United States. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect Howmet and its customers and suppliers, including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, Howmet utilizes natural gas, electricity and other fuels to operate its facilities. Significant increased energy costs, including as a result of new laws, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers.\nPhysical risks associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure to, and impact of, events with damage due to flooding, extreme winds and extreme precipitation for Howmet locations, suppliers or customers. Prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires, which may have an adverse effect on production capacity of Howmet sites, suppliers and customers. These types of incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to the various transaction agreements that the Company entered into with Arconic Corporation and with Alcoa Corporation in connection with its separation transactions, if the counterparties fail to meet their obligations under such agreements or if we are required to pay under certain indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIn connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, we entered into various agreements with Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation, respectively, including separation and distribution agreements, tax matters agreements, employee matters agreements, intellectual property license agreements, and metal supply agreements. We rely on Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If either Arconic Corporation or Alcoa Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under its applicable agreements, we could incur operational difficulties and/or material losses.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, and certain other agreements between us and Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2020, and certain other agreements between us and Arconic Corporation, Arconic Corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Alcoa Corporation and Arconic Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Alcoa Corporation or Arconic Corporation, as applicable, agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the Company\u2019s operations. Further, Alcoa Corporation or Arconic Corporation, as applicable, may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Alcoa Corporation or Arconic Corporation, as applicable, any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction could result in substantial tax liability.\nIt was a condition to the distribution of all outstanding shares of Arconic Corporation common stock to the Company\u2019s stockholders (the \u201cDistribution of Arconic\u201d), which effected the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, that we receive an opinion of our outside counsel, satisfactory to our Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). This condition was satisfied prior to the Distribution of Arconic. However, the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings by us and Arconic Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct by us and Arconic Corporation. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Arconic Corporation breach any of our representations or covenants contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding our receipt of the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that: (i) the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii) a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, we, our stockholders and Arconic Corporation, could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIf the Distribution of Arconic fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the Arconic Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who received such Arconic Corporation shares in the Distribution of Arconic would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Arconic, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Arconic may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of ours or Arconic Corporation. Under the tax matters agreement entered into between us and Arconic Corporation in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation may be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Arconic Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Arconic Corporation, or (iii) any of Arconic Corporation\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Arconic Corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic Corporation any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from transactions (including the internal reorganization) in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risks\nAnti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Howmet, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Howmet\u2019s shareholders.\nHowmet\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Howmet is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Howmet. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other anti-takeover measures without stockholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Howmet\u2019s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Howmet common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.", "PERMNO": 24643, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "HWM"}
