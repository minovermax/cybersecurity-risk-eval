{"cik": "1645469", "company": "Monopar Therapeutics", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. A prospective investor should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and prospective investors could lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not exhaustive; other significant risks may exist that are not identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but that might still materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations were any of such risks to occur.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to incur significant operating losses, and have a high risk of never being profitable.\nWe commenced operations in December 2014 and have a limited operating history of almost three years. Therefore, there is limited historical financial or operational information upon which to evaluate our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. Most companies in our industry at our stage of development never become profitable, and are acquired or go out of business without successfully developing any product that generates revenue from commercial sales.\nFrom inception in December 2014 through December 31, 2017, we have incurred losses of approximately $18.4 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years for the clinical development of our current and future licensed or purchased drug product candidates.\nThe amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will become profitable are uncertain. We do not have any products that have generated any revenues from commercial sales, and do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, if ever. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; obtaining adequate reimbursement by third party payers; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations are expected to be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a new public reporting company, we are subject to SEC reporting and other requirements, which will lead to increased operating costs in order to meet these requirements.\nIf we continue to incur operating losses and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to advance our development programs, complete our clinical trials, or bring products to market, or may be forced to cease operations entirely. In addition, any capital obtained by us may be obtained on terms that are unfavorable to us, our investors, or both.\nDeveloping a new drug and conducting clinical trials for one or more disease indications involves substantial costs. We have projected cash requirements for the near term based on a variety of assumptions, but some or all of such assumptions are likely to be incorrect and/or incomplete, possibly materially in an adverse direction. Our actual cash needs may deviate materially from those projections, changes in market conditions or other factors may increase our cash requirements, or we may not be successful even in raising the amount of cash we currently project will be required for the near term. See discussion of our material development agreements in \u201cMaterial Agreements\u201d. We will need to raise additional capital in the future; the amount of additional capital needed will vary as a result of a number of factors, including without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nreceiving less funding than we require;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs to manufacture our active pharmaceutical ingredient and our drug product candidates;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs for preclinical testing;\n\u25cf\nan increase in the number, size, duration, or complexity of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected progress in developing Validive, MNPR-201, MNPR-101, or other drug product candidates, including without limitation, additional costs caused by program delays;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs associated with attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, including without limitation additional costs caused by additional regulatory requirements or larger clinical trial requirements;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected personnel or other costs, such as adding personnel or pursuing the licensing/acquisition of additional assets; and\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs to protect our intellectual property portfolio or otherwise pursue our intellectual property strategy.\nIf we attempt to raise additional financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional financing in sufficient quantities or at all. We may be unable to raise additional capital for reasons including without limitation our financial performance, investor confidence in us and the biopharmaceutical industry, credit availability from banks and other financial institutions, the status of current projects, and our prospects for obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. Potential investors\u2019 capital investments may be shifted to other opportunities with perceived greater returns and/or lower risk thereby reducing capital available to us, if at all.\nIn addition, any additional financing might not be available and even if available, may not be available on terms favorable to us or our then-existing investors. We may seek to raise funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements, mergers, acquisitions, sales of intellectual property, or other financing vehicles or arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or other securities, our then-existing investors may experience significant dilution. If we raise funds through debt financings or bank loans, we may become subject to restrictive covenants, our assets may be pledged as collateral for the debt, and the interests of our then-existing investors would be subordinated to the debt holders or banks. In addition, our use of and ability to exploit assets pledged as collateral for debt or loans may be restricted or forfeited. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish significant rights (including without limitation intellectual property rights) to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are not able to raise needed funding under acceptable terms or at all, then we will have to reduce expenses, including the possible options of curtailing operations, abandoning opportunities, selling off assets, reducing costs, or ceasing operations entirely.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving approvals from various U.S. and international governmental agencies and will be severely harmed if we are not granted approval to manufacture and sell our drug product candidates.\nIn order for us to commercialize any treatment for a cancer indication or for any other clinical indication, we must obtain regulatory approvals of such treatment for that indication. Satisfying regulatory requirements is an expensive process that typically takes many years and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion of drugs for human use. To obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that our products are safe and effective, that our clinical trials will demonstrate the necessary safety and effectiveness of our drug product candidates, or that we will succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any treatment we develop even if such safety and effectiveness are demonstrated.\nAny delays or difficulties we encounter in our clinical trials may delay or preclude regulatory approval from the FDA or from international regulatory organizations. Any delay or preclusion of regulatory approval would be expected to delay or preclude the commercialization of our products. Examples of delays or difficulties that we may encounter in our clinical trials include without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nClinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the use of our products.\n\u25cf\nOur products may fail to be more effective than current therapies, or to be effective at all.\n\u25cf\nWe may discover that our products have adverse side effects, which could cause our products to be delayed or precluded from receiving regulatory approval or otherwise expose us to significant commercial and legal risks.\n\u25cf\nIt may take longer than expected to determine whether or not a treatment is effective.\n\u25cf\nPatients involved in our clinical trials may suffer severe adverse side effects even up to death, whether as a result of treatment with our products, the withholding of such treatment, or other reasons (whether within or outside of our control).\n\u25cf\nWe may fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nPatients enrolled in our clinical trials may not have the characteristics necessary to obtain regulatory approval for a particular indication.\n\u25cf\nWe may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of product to complete the clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nEven if we are successful in our clinical trials, any required governmental approvals may still not be obtained or, if obtained, may not be maintained.\n\u25cf\nIf approval for commercialization is granted, it is possible the authorized use will be more limited than is necessary for commercial success, or that approval may be conditioned on completion of further clinical trials or other activities, which will cause a substantial increase in costs and which we might not succeed in performing or completing.\n\u25cf\nIf granted, approval may be withdrawn or limited if problems with our products emerge or are suggested by the data arising from their use or if there is a change in law or regulation.\nAny success we may achieve at a given stage of our clinical trials does not guarantee that we will achieve success at any subsequent stage, including without limitation final FDA approval.\nWe may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation resulting from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in the policies of the FDA or other regulatory bodies during the period of product development, clinical trials, or regulatory review. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or an injunction preventing certain activity, as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us. As a company, we have no experience in successfully obtaining regulatory approval for a drug and thus may be poorly equipped to gauge, and may prove unable to manage risks relating to obtaining such approval.\nOutside the U.S., our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from appropriate non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Non-U.S. regulatory approval typically includes all of the risks associated with FDA clearance discussed above as well as the additional uncertainties and potential prejudices faced by U.S. companies conducting business abroad. In certain cases, pricing restrictions and practices can make achieving even limited profitability very difficult.\nIf we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications, or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products and lose time to market and potential revenues.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates. We currently contract with outside sources to manufacture MNPR-101. In order to be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of MNPR-101 to be able to proceed with human clinical trials, Cancer Research UK developed a new cell line under our CTOA. We received notification of termination of CRUK\u2019s work on MNPR-101 under the CTOA on March 21, 2018. There can be no assurance that this new cell line will be successful or that sufficient quantities of MNPR-101 will be able to be manufactured. Since Cancer Research UK has decided to terminate its involvement with MNPR-101, we will need to make other arrangements for the clinical testing, development and manufacture of our drug product candidate. There can be no assurance that such alternative arrangements can be made or on terms favorable to us. We in the future may become unable, for various reasons, to rely on our sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial distribution. We may not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any we do identify. We may face competition for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. Even if we are able to identify an additional or replacement third-party manufacturer, the delays and costs associated with establishing and maintaining a relationship with such manufacturer may have a material adverse effect on us.\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture Validive, MNPR-201, MNPR-101, or any other product candidate, we must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, commonly known as \u201ccGMP\u201d, and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to ensure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay or prevent FDA approval of our products. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products and will lose time to market and potential revenues.\nIt is uncertain whether insurance will be adequate to address product liability claims, or that insurance against such claims will be affordable or available on acceptable terms in the future.\nClinical research involves the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a clinical trial protocol. Such testing involves a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients due to, among other causes, adverse side effects, improper administration of the new drug, or improper volunteer behavior. Claims may arise from patients, clinical trial volunteers, consumers, physicians, hospitals, companies, institutions, researchers, or others using, selling, or buying our products, as well as from governmental bodies. In addition, product liability and related risks are likely to increase over time, in particular upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or parties with which we enter into development, marketing, or distribution collaborations. Although we are contracting for general liability insurance in connection with our ongoing business, there can be no assurance that the amount and scope of such insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient in the event any claims arise, that we will be able to secure additional coverage should we attempt to do so, or that our insurers would not contest or refuse any attempt by us to collect on such insurance policies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that suitable insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that, if obtained, the insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nCorporate, non-profit, and academic collaborators may take actions (including lack of effective actions) to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.\nOur operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug product candidates is heavily dependent on us entering into collaborations with corporations, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such collaborations. Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator. For example, our collaboration with Cancer Research UK on MNPR-101, we recently received notification of termination by CRUK of its involvement with MNPR-101 and we will need to seek alternate arrangements. Replacement collaborations might not be available on attractive terms, or at all. The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be in our power to influence. There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all; that we will derive any revenue, profits, or benefit from such collaborations; or that any collaborator will not compete with us. If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and commercialization of our proposed products, and may not be able to develop and commercialize such products effectively, if at all. In addition, a lack of development and commercialization collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets. Furthermore, current or future collaborators may act deliberately or inadvertently in ways detrimental to our interests.\nThe termination of third-party licenses could adversely affect our rights to important compounds.\nWe rely on certain rights to MNPR-101 that we have secured through a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA. XOMA, as licensor, has the ability to terminate the license if we breach our obligations under the license agreement and do not remedy any such breach in time after receiving written notice of such breach from XOMA. A termination of the license agreement might force us to cease developing and/or selling MNPR-101, if it gets to market. We have exercised our option to license Validive; as such, Onxeo has the ability to terminate the license if we breach our obligations under the option and license agreement. A termination of the option and license agreement might force us to cease developing and/or selling Validive.\nData provided by collaborators and other parties upon which we rely have not been independently verified and could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and business. We do not independently verify or audit all of such data (including possibly material portions thereof). As a result, such data may be inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.\nIn certain cases, we rely on a single supplier for a particular manufacturing material, and any interruption in or termination of service by such supplier could delay or disrupt the commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the materials used to manufacture our compounds. Some of these materials may only be available from one supplier. Any interruption in or termination of service by such single source suppliers could result in a delay or disruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in locating such alternative source of supply or in negotiating acceptable terms with such prospective supplier.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur product development efforts are at an early stage. We have not yet undertaken any marketing efforts, and there can be no assurances that future anticipated market testing and analyses will validate our marketing strategy and therefore we may need to modify the products, or will not be successful in either developing or marketing those products.\nWe have not completed the development or clinical trials of any product candidates and, accordingly, have not yet begun to market or generate revenue from the commercialization of any products. Commercializing these product candidates will require substantial additional research and development as well as costly clinical trials. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete development of our product candidates or successfully market them. We may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval, intellectual property rights of product candidates, or other factors. There can be no assurance that our development programs will be successful, that our products, if successfully developed, will prove to be safe and effective in or after clinical trials, that the necessary regulatory approvals for any product candidates will be obtained, or, even if obtained, will be as broad as sought or will be maintained for any period thereafter, that patents will issue on our patent applications, that any intellectual property protections we secure will be adequate, or that our collaboration arrangements will not diminish the value of our intellectual property through licensing or other arrangements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any product we might market will be received favorably by customers (whether physicians, patients, or both), adequately reimbursed by third party payers, or that competitive products will not perform better and/or be marketed more successfully. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any future market testing and analyses will validate our marketing strategies. We may need to seek to modify the product labels through additional studies in order to be able to market them successfully.\nIf we are unable to establish relationships with licensees or collaborators to carry out sales, marketing, and distribution functions or to create effective marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities, we will be unable to market our products successfully.\nOur business strategy may include out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with any third party, that such relationships, if established, will be successful, or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any products we might develop. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues per unit sold are expected to be lower than if we marketed, sold, and distributed our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties.\nIf we are unable to establish such third-party marketing and sales relationships, or choose not to do so, we would have to establish in-house marketing and sales capabilities. We have no experience in marketing or selling oncology pharmaceutical products, and currently have no marketing, sales, or distribution infrastructure and no experience developing or managing such infrastructure for an oncology product. To market any products directly, we would have to establish a marketing, sales, and distribution force that had technical expertise and could support a distribution capability. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for technically proficient marketing, sales, and distribution personnel is intense and attracting and retaining such personnel may significantly increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities or that these capabilities will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nCommercial success of our product candidates will depend on the acceptance of these products by physicians and patients.\nAny product candidate that we may develop may not gain market acceptance among physicians and patients. Market acceptance of and demand for any product that we may develop will depend on many factors, including without limitation:\n\u25cf\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\npotential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\ncost effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement;\n\u25cf\nstrength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy.\nIf any product candidate developed by us receives regulatory approval but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance by physicians and patients, we may generate little or no product revenue and may not become profitable.\nOur products may not be accepted for reimbursement or properly reimbursed by third-party payers.\nThe successful commercialization of any products we might develop will depend substantially on whether the costs of our products and related treatments are reimbursed at acceptable levels by government authorities, private healthcare insurers, and other third-party payers, such as health maintenance organizations. Reimbursement rates may vary, depending upon the third-party payer, the type of insurance plan, and other similar or dissimilar factors. If our products are not subject to adequate reimbursement, physicians may not prescribe for our products in sufficient amounts to make our products profitable.\nComparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor\u2019s product could adversely affect the sales of our drug product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nAdequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the U.S. there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.\nIn addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nAny development along these lines could materially and adversely affect our prospects. We are unable to predict what legislative or regulatory changes relating to the healthcare industry, including without limitation any changes affecting governmental and/or private or third party coverage and reimbursement, may be enacted in the future, or what effect such legislative or regulatory changes would have on our business.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws; these laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. Fraud and abuse laws are expected to increase in breadth and in detail, which will likely increase our operating costs and the complexity of our programs to insure compliance with such enhanced laws.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the U.S., our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, distributors, or other business partners, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes which may increase our operating costs. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to criminal actions and significant civil monetary penalties, which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\nNegotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.\nGovernment payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval, however, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our (and our licensors\u2019) development efforts to develop competing drugs.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for any products and other technologies we might develop, and successfully defending any patents we obtain against third-party challenges. We license all intellectual property related to Validive from Onxeo S.A., a French public company. See \u201cMaterial Agreements\u201d. The assignment and transfer of the MNPR-201 (GPX-150) patent portfolio from TacticGem, LLC to us has been completed. We filed and have been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world patents for antibodies that target uPAR. We have also been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world patents to a specific sequence of amino acids on uPAR, to which our MNPR-101 antibody binds. We are currently prosecuting this patent in other countries around the world to further protect MNPR-101. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining and defending patents. See \u201cIntellectual Property Portfolio\u201d. These risks and uncertainties include without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nPatents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; or may not provide any competitive advantage for other reasons.\n\u25cf\nOur competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international markets.\n\u25cf\nAs a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of domestic and international patent protection for cancer treatments that prove successful.\n\u25cf\nCountries other than the U.S. may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by the U.S. courts; therefore, non-U.S. competitors could exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition, the USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nIf we permit our patents to lapse or expire, we will not be protected and will have less of a competitive advantage. The value of our products may be greatly reduced if this occurs. Our patents expire at different times and are subject to the laws of multiple countries. Some of our patents are currently near expiration and we may pursue patent term extensions for these where appropriate. See \u201cIntellectual Property Portfolio\u201d.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. While we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and invention agreements with our consultants and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will be fully enforceable and will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are not fully enforceable or are breached, that any remedy for a breach will adequately compensate us, that these agreements will achieve their intended aims, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events for which we cannot provide assurances occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nIntellectual property disputes could require us to spend time and money to address such disputes and could limit our intellectual property rights.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine the priority of inventions. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets. Even if a given patent or intellectual property dispute were settled through licensing or similar arrangements, our costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include the payment by us of large fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, the costs of litigation may prevent us from pursuing these claims or defenses and/or may require extensive financial and personnel resources to pursue these claims or defenses.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history as we are a new entity.\nAs of March 1, 2018, we have engaged exclusively in acquiring pharmaceutical drug product candidates, licensing rights to drug product candidates and entering into collaboration agreements, and have not completed any clinical trials, received any governmental approvals, brought any product to market, manufactured or produced products in commercial quantities or sold any pharmaceutical products. We have limited experience in negotiating, establishing, and maintaining strategic relationships, conducting clinical trials, and managing the regulatory approval process, all of which will be necessary if we are to be successful. Our lack of experience in these critical areas makes it difficult for a prospective investor to evaluate our abilities, and increases the risk that we will fail to successfully execute our strategies.\nFurthermore, if our business grows rapidly, our operational, managerial, legal, and financial resources will be strained. Our development will require continued improvement and expansion of our management team and our operational, managerial, legal, and financial systems and controls.\nIn the normal course of business, we have evaluated and expect to evaluate potential acquisitions and/or licenses of patents, compounds, and technologies that our management believes could complement or expand our business. We have limited history of conducting acquisitions, and negotiating and acquiring licenses. In the event that we identify an acquisition or license candidate we find attractive, there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating an agreement to acquire or license, or in financing or profitably exploiting, such patents, compounds, or technologies. Furthermore, such an acquisition or license could divert management time and resources away from other activities that would further our business development.\nIf we lose key management leadership, and/or scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees, managers, directors, officers, or other significant personnel, we may experience delays and increases in compensation costs, and our business materially disrupted.\nOur future success is highly dependent on the continued service of principal members of our management, leadership, and scientific personnel, who are able to terminate their employment with us at any time, and may be able to compete with us. The loss of any of our key management, leadership, or scientific personnel including in particular, Chandler D. Robinson, our President and CEO, and Andrew P. Mazar, our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, and Chief Scientific Officer, could materially disrupt our business and materially delay or prevent the successful commercialization of our product candidates. We have employment agreements with Dr. Robinson and Dr. Mazar which have no term but are for at-will employment, meaning the executives have the ability to terminate their employment at any time.\nOur future success will also depend on our continuing ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of the organization. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for scientifically and technically qualified personnel is intense, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. Our continued ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled personnel may cause our compensation costs to increase materially.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do take advantage of these exemptions, the information that we provide stockholders will be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result of our status as an emerging growth company, there may be less liquidity for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Act.\nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug and chemical companies, specialized biopharmaceutical firms, and universities and other research institutions. These companies, firms, and other institutions may develop products that are more effective than our product candidates or that would make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Many of these companies, firms, and other institutions have greater financial resources than us and may be better able to withstand and respond to adverse market conditions within the biopharmaceutical industry, including without limitation the lengthy regulatory approval process for product candidates.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial costs to defend them and address any damages awarded, and demand for our products could be reduced as a result of such lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products is subject to an inherent risk of product liability claims. Since we currently are not sponsoring a clinical trial, we do not have product liability insurance coverage, but plan to obtain appropriate coverage when we enroll patients in a Validive or other clinical trial. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation and significant, adverse media attention;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers; and\n\u25cf\npotentially significant litigation costs, including without limitation any damages awarded to the plaintiffs if we lose or settle claims.\nWe use hazardous materials, including radioactive materials, in our business, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could materially harm our business.\nOur business involves the use of a broad range of hazardous chemicals and materials, including radioactive materials. Environmental laws impose stringent civil and criminal penalties for improper handling, disposal, and storage of these materials. In addition, in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials, we could be subject to civil damages due to personal injury or property damage caused by the release or exposure. A failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits, which could prevent us from conducting our business.\nWe have limited the liability of and indemnified our directors and officers.\nAlthough our directors and officers are accountable to us and must exercise good faith, good business judgement, and integrity in handling our affairs, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), provides that our directors will be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. As a result, our stockholders may have fewer rights against our directors than they would have absent such provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, and a stockholder\u2019s ability to seek and recover damages for a breach of fiduciary duties may be reduced or restricted. Delaware law allows indemnification if our Board Member (a) has acted in good faith, in a manner the Board Member reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to our best interests, and (b) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if the Board Member had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, each director and (to the extent approved by our Board) each of our officers who is made a party to a legal proceeding because he or she is or was a Board Member or officer, is indemnified by us from and against any and all liability, except that we may not indemnify a Board Member or officer: (a) for any liability incurred in a proceeding in which such person is adjudged liable to Monopar or is subjected to injunctive relief in favor of Monopar; (b) for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, fraud or gross negligence; (c) for unlawful distributions; (d) for any transaction for which such Board Member or officer received a personal benefit or as otherwise prohibited by or as may be disallowed under Delaware law; or (e) with respect to any dispute or proceeding between us and such Board Member or officer unless such indemnification has been approved by a disinterested majority of Board Members or by a majority in interest of disinterested stockholders. We are required to pay or reimburse attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of a Board Member seeking indemnification as they are incurred, provided the director executes an agreement to repay the amount to be paid or reimbursed if there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\nFuture legislation or executive or private sector actions may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our products and affect the prices obtained for such products.\nThere have been several attempts made to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), and modification and partial or complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the future is possible. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law - one of its provisions repealed what is known as the individual mandate under PPACA which could have the effect of negating such law. Healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved.\nThe increasing cost of healthcare as a percentage of GDP and the increasing deferred liabilities behind most governmental health care programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) continue to be an economic challenge which affects the overall economic health of the U.S. High cost products and therapies that are early in their life cycle, are attractive targets for parties that believe that the cost of healthcare must be better controlled and reduced. Pharmaceutical prices and healthcare reform has been debated and acted upon by legislators for many years. Future legislation or executive or private sector actions related to healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue at prices sufficient to reward for the risks and costs of development, to raise capital, and to market our products.\nAdditionally, Executive Orders and policy statements issued by President Trump have increased the uncertainty regarding the timing for the FDA\u2019s interpretation and implementation of requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d). Some of these executive actions may also negatively affect the FDA\u2019s exercise of regulatory oversight and ability to timely review industry submissions and applications in connection with the drug development and approval process. Notably, on April 12, 2017, the Director for the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) implemented a long-term plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Although the FDA is funded in the near-term, in the future, an under-staffed FDA could result in increasing delays in the FDA\u2019s responsiveness or in its ability to review applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all. A January 30, 2017 Executive Order also included a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be interpreted and implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA\u2019s ability to continue engaging in its regulatory authorities under the FDCA. If executive or legislative actions impose restrictions on the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. On August 18, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 was signed which, among other things, established user fees for human drug applications which are to be directed toward expediting the drug development process. On December 12, 2017, an amendment to the FDCA was passed to authorize additional emergency uses for medical products during a military emergency. Both of these actions restore increased funding for the FDA. The user fees for human drug applications can result in funding which is variable depending on the work load created by applications that is supported by the user fees. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and third party payers will affect the pharmaceutical industry in general and our business in particular.\nFuture tax reform measures may negatively impact our financial position.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by tax reform measures. If tax reform measures are passed, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive favorable tax treatment related to our patents. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, treatment of proceeds from the sale of \u201cself-created\u201d patents as ordinary income, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of orphan drugs from 50% to 25%). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock. It is difficult to predict what future tax reform measures, if any, could be implemented and the extent to which they will impact our accounting practices and our business.\nOur anticipated operating expenses over the next year are based upon our management\u2019s estimates of possible future events. Actual amounts could differ materially from those estimated by our management.\nDevelopment of pharmaceuticals and cancer drugs is extremely risky and unpredictable. We have estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures over the next year based on certain assumptions. Any change in the assumptions could and will cause the actual results to vary substantially from the anticipated expenditures, and could result in material differences in actual versus forecasted expenses or expenditures. Furthermore, all of the factors are subject to the effect of unforeseeable future events. The estimates of capital expenditures and operating expenses represent forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risk factors set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K. In view of the foregoing, investors should not rely on these estimates in making a decision to invest in us.\nRisks Associated with Our Capital Stock\nWe may never provide liquidity to our investors.\nNo public market exists with respect to any of our securities. There is no assurance that any public offering, merger, combination, sale, or other liquidity event relating to us will ever take place, or that any public offering, merger, combination, sale, or other event that might take place would provide liquidity for our investors or that we will be able to provide liquidity to our investors in any fashion. In the event that we are unable to affect a public offering, merger, combination, sale, or other liquidity event, our investors would likely be unable to sell their interests in us.\nExisting and new investors will experience dilution as a result of future sales or issuances of our common stock and future option exercises under our stock option plan.\nOur Board Members, employees, and certain of our consultants have been and will be issued equity and/or granted options that vest with the passage of time. Up to a total of 1,600,000 shares of our Common Stock may be issued as stock options or restricted stock under the Amended and Restated Monopar Therapeutics Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, and stock options for the purchase of up to 690,596 shares of our common stock have already been granted. See Item 11 - \u201cStock Option Plan.\u201d The issuance of such equity and/or the exercise of such options will dilute both our existing and our new investors. As of March 1, 2018, no stock options have been exercised.\nOur existing and our new investors will likely also experience substantial dilution resulting from the issuance by us of equity securities in connection with certain transactions, including without limitation, future offering of shares, intellectual property licensing, acquisition, or commercialization arrangements.\nHolders of the shares of our Common Stock will have no control of our operations or of decisions on major transactions.\nOur business and affairs are managed by or under the direction of our Board. Our Stockholders are entitled to vote only on actions that require a Stockholder vote under federal or state law. Stockholder approval requires the consent and approval of holders of a majority or more of our outstanding stock. Shares of stock do not have cumulative voting rights and therefore, holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock will be able to elect all Board Members. TacticGem, LLC owns 7,166,667 shares of common stock (77.1%). The limited liability company agreement of TacticGem, LLC provides that the manager will vote its shares of Monopar to elect to the Board of Directors those persons nominated by TacticPharma LLC plus one person nominated by Gem Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Additionally, other than in the elections of directors the limited liability company agreement requires TacticGem to pass through votes to its members in proportion to their membership percentages in TacticGem. As a result, Tactic Pharma, our initial investor, holds an approximately 46% beneficial interest in us and together with Gem\u2019s beneficial ownership of approximately 33%, the two entities control a majority of our stock and will be able to elect all Board Members and control our affairs. Some of our Board Members and executive officers own and control Tactic Pharma. Although no single person has a controlling interest in Tactic Pharma, acting together, they are able to control Tactic Pharma and a large voting block of Monopar and elect over a majority of our Board of Directors. See Item 12 - \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.\u201d\nOur ability to list on Nasdaq in the future will require raising significant additional capital and likely require a public stock transaction; failure to qualify to trade on Nasdaq will make it more difficult to raise capital.\nWe will need to raise significant funds in the next 24 months to execute our clinical development plans and we believe that if our stock is trading on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market it will enable better access to capital. Nasdaq has listing requirements for inclusion of securities for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, including stockholders equity of $4 million (market value standard) or $5 million (equity standard), market value of publicly held shares of $15 million, an operating history of 2 years under the equity standard or a market value of listed securities of $50 million under the market value standard, 1 million publicly held shares, 300 shareholders, three market makers and a $4 bid price or a closing price of $3 (equity standard) or $2 (market value standard). If we are unable to list on Nasdaq, it could make it harder for us to raise capital in both the immediate time frame and in the long-term. If we are unable to raise capital when needed in the future, we may have to cease or reduce operations.", "PERMNO": 19142, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MNPR"}
