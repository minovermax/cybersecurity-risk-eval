{"cik": "912752", "company": "SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described below, along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impair our business operations and our liquidity in an adverse way.\nRisks relating to our operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak or pandemic of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to our business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the economy, our advertisers, our leagues and teams, viewership, Distributors, and their subscribers.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Over the course of 2020 and continuing into 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus has had a significant negative impact on the global economy, including many industries in which our customers operate, curtailing advertising revenue. The pandemic has also resulted in disruptions to professional sports resulting in fewer games produced during the year, which negatively impacted advertising and distribution revenue.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on future periods will depend significantly on the duration and potential cyclicality of the health crisis, the related public policy actions taken by federal, state, and local governments to limit the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and the timing for, and success of, the COVID-19 vaccination program. COVID-19 (or a future pandemic) could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to our business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors:\n\u2022the suspension, and possible cancellation, of some or all of the MLB, NBA and NHL seasons, and tennis tournaments;\n\u2022the requirement of our RSNs to pay professional sports team minimum rights fees, regardless of the number of games played in a season;\n\u2022the need to reimburse Distributor affiliation fees related to canceled professional sporting events;\n\u2022loss of advertising revenue due to postponement or cancellation of professional sporting events;\n\u2022loss of advertising revenue as advertisers may be more reluctant to purchase advertising spots/impressions due to reduced consumer spending as a result of shelter in place and stay at home orders;\n\u2022lack of liquidity and access to capital resources that may cause one or more Distributors or advertisers to be unable to meet their obligations to us or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations;\n\u2022the significant disruption to the operations of the professional sports leagues and the macroeconomy caused by COVID-19 may result in the recognition of impairment charges on our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets;\n\u2022we may be unable to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital\nnecessary to fund business operations, pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, and increase our future interest expense;\n\u2022the financial impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect our future ability to pay dividends, and comply with financial and other covenants of the term loans and revolving credit agreements of STG and DSG (individually, the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, and together, the Bank Credit Agreements), the indentures governing STG\u2019s and DSG\u2019s outstanding notes, and the accounts receivable securitization facility (A/R Facility), and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the payment of such debt; and\n\u2022the interruption to global supply chains caused by COVID-19 could impact our ability to migrate off of various transition services provided by the seller of acquired assets which we rely upon to conduct our business in the local sports segment; and\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of our executive officers, employees or Board of Directors, particularly if a significant number are impacted, or the impact of government actions or restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, restricting access to our headquarters located in Hunt Valley, Maryland, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our sports team partners, Distributors and advertisers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others.\nA prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact the ability of our sports team partners, Distributors and advertisers to generate sufficient revenues, and could force them to default on their obligations to us or result in their bankruptcy or insolvency. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on us. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows.\nOur strategic acquisitions and investments could pose various risks and increase our leverage.\nWe have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, subject to market conditions, our liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition and investment candidates, with the goal of improving our business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisitions or investment targets, or we may not be able to fund additional acquisitions or investments in the future.\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could strain our human resources. For example, as a result of our acquisition of the Acquired RSNs in August 2019, we borrowed approximately $8.2 billion, substantially increasing our leverage and debt service requirements. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies, or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. In addition, future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities, may result in the diversion of management's attention from the operation of our core business and may limit our ability to generate higher returns elsewhere.\nCertain acquisitions, such as television stations, are subject to the approval of the FCC and potentially, other regulatory authorities, such as the DOJ. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest certain television stations or businesses if the FCC or other regulatory authority believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market, even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations or other regulations. There can be no assurance that future acquisitions will be approved by the FCC or other regulatory authorities, or that a requirement to divest existing stations or businesses will not have an adverse outcome on the transaction.\nIf the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to Distributor services increases or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include our programming networks, there may be a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nDuring the last few years, the number of subscribers to Distributor services in the United States has been declining, and the rate accelerated in 2020, as technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news, sports and other entertainment, including through the so-called \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies. The Distributor subscriber decline has led to a decline in subscribers from some of our stations and networks. For example, subscribers of the Acquired RSNs fell by high single digits percent during the year ended December 31, 2020 on a same Distributor basis. In addition, Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our programming networks.\nIf Distributor service offerings are not attractive to consumers for any reason (pricing, increased competition from OTT and DTC services, increased dissatisfaction with the quality of Distributor services, poor economic conditions or other factors), more consumers may (i) cancel their Distributor service subscriptions, (ii) elect to instead subscribe to OTT services, which in some cases may be offered at lower prices, or (iii) elect to subscribe to Distributors with smaller bundles of programming which may not include our programming networks.\nIf the rate of decline in the number of Distributor service subscribers increases or if subscribers shift to OTT services or smaller bundles of programming that do not include our programming networks, this may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nWe may not be able to renegotiate distribution agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements and networks with which we are affiliated currently, or in the future, and they may require us to share revenue from distribution agreements with them.\nAs distribution agreements expire, we may not be able to renegotiate such agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. This may cause revenues and/or revenue growth from our distribution agreements to decrease under the renegotiated terms despite the fact that our current distribution agreements include automatic annual fee escalators. In addition, certain networks or program service providers with which our stations are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from distribution agreements with them as part of renewing expiring affiliation agreements or pursuant to certain rights contained in existing affiliation agreements. Generally, our distribution agreements and agreements with networks or program service providers are for different lengths of time and expire in different periods. If we are unable to negotiate a distribution agreement or the revenue received as part of those agreements declines over time, then we may be exposed to a reduction in or loss from distribution revenue net of revenue shared with networks and program service providers. We cannot predict the outcome or provide assurances as to the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our distribution agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of current expirations of our affiliation agreements.\nWe face intense, wide-ranging competition for viewers and advertisers.\nWe compete, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for viewers and advertisers with other programming networks, pay-per-view, video on demand, online streaming services, and other content offered by distributors. We also compete for viewers and advertisers with OTT and DTC, mobile media, radio, motion picture, home video, stadiums and arenas, and other sources of information and entertainment and advertising services. Important competitive factors are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control) and variety of the programming offered and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.\nWith respect to advertising services, factors affecting the degree and extent of competition include prices, reach and audience demographics, among others. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial resources available to them than we do, which could impact our viewership and the resulting advertising revenues.\nRivals that may have greater resources than we have include:\n\u2022other local free over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations;\n\u2022Distributors, such as telecommunication companies, cable providers and direct broadcast satellite providers;\n\u2022print media providers such as newspapers, direct mail and periodicals;\n\u2022internet search engines, internet service providers, social media platforms, websites, and mobile applications;\n\u2022OTT technologies;\n\u2022Distributor \"skinny\" packages;\n\u2022mobile television; and\n\u2022other emerging technologies.\nCompetition from other broadcasters or other content providers and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and/or an increase in our operating costs.\nNew technology and the subdivision of markets\nDistributors are developing or have developed new technology that allows them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. The decreased cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue. In addition, technologies that allow viewers to digitally record, store, and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services such as Nielsen or Comscore and, as a result, lower our advertising revenues. The current ratings provided by Nielsen for use by broadcast stations for live viewing Digital Video Recording playback are limited to seven days past the original air date. Additionally, in most markets, no credit is given for online viewing. The effects of new ratings data methodologies, many of which are used in our markets, and the ability of such methodologies to be a reliable standard that can be used by advertisers is still under review for accreditation from The MRC. Local audience measurement has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nielsen relies heavily on in-person recruitment and maintenance, so social distancing guidelines have not allowed for proper sample maintenance. As a result, panels have become skewed, unbalanced, and less reliable. Due to this issue, MRC accreditation for certain data have been put on hiatus as Nielsen works to correct their local panels.\nDistributors may include over-the-air antennas within their set-top boxes allowing them to provide free over-the-air signals to their subscribers which could result in decreases in our distribution revenues received for our signal being carried on their channels.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will remain competitive with these developing technologies.\nWe depend on the appeal of our programming, which may be unpredictable, and increased programming costs may have a material negative effect on our business and our results of operations.\nWe depend in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our stations and networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, or a decrease in viewership of our programming, may materially negatively affect us and our results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties for broadcast, entertainment, news, sports and other programming for our stations and networks. We compete with other providers of programming to acquire the rights to distribute such programming. If we fail to continue to obtain broadcast, entertainment, news, sports and other programming for our stations and networks on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming, which may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nFurther change in the current retransmission consent regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDistributors lobby to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations.\nIn September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the \u201ctotality of the circumstances test\u201d for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a \u201cmarquee sports or entertainment event,\u201d restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters\u2019 ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters\u2019 ability to invoke the FCC\u2019s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. In July 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations, however, the proceeding remains open.\nAs further described under Item 1. Business - Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting, the FCC also has pending a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which seeks additional comment on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules.\nThe FCC rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. In May 2020, the FCC revised its good faith negotiation rules to specify that certain small MVPDs can meet the obligation to negotiate in good faith by negotiating with a large station group through a qualified MVPD buying group and that large station groups have an obligation to negotiate in good faith with such MVPD buying groups.\nThe FCC\u2019s prohibition on the possible elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules and certain joint retransmission consent negotiations may affect our ability to sustain our current level of distribution revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTheft of our intellectual property may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations, and we may become subject to infringement or other claims relating to our consent or technology.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize the material intellectual property rights in our programming, technology, digital and other content. Our intellectual property rights may be infringed upon by unauthorized usage of original broadcast content, RSN telecast feeds (including, without limitation, live and non-live content) and other content for which the RSNs and/or the applicable league/team hold copyright ownership or distribution rights. Such unauthorized usage may occur on any and all distribution platforms, including, without limitation, linear and streaming services. Additionally, our intellectual property rights may be further infringed upon by third-party unauthorized distribution of original broadcast content, game content and/or highlights on social media platforms on a live or near live basis. Third-party licensors of content may infringe upon our intellectual property rights by not complying with content distribution rules, local territory blackout rules and RSN distribution exclusivity windows.\nTheft, misappropriation or the invalidity of our intellectual property or the intellectual property that is licensed to us by licensors (including sports teams) could have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations by potentially reducing the revenue that we are able to obtain from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermining lawful and revenue-generating distribution channels, limiting our ability to control the marketing of our content and inhibiting our ability to recoup expenses or profit from the costs we incur creating our programming content. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert management's attention from the operation of our business.\nWhile our programming personnel regularly monitor third-party streaming platforms and social media pages in an effort to identify intellectual property infringement and work closely with content distributors and leagues to notify content protection representatives to take the necessary steps to protect our and their intellectual property rights, those protective measures cannot ensure that theft, misappropriation or the invalidity of our intellectual property or the intellectual property that is licensed to us by licensors will not occur.\nIn addition, from time to time, third parties may assert claims against us alleging intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to our programming, technology, digital or other content. If any such infringement claim results in the loss of certain of our intellectual property rights, it could have a materially negative impact our business and the results of our operations.\nCybersecurity risks, cyber incidents, data privacy, and other information technology failures could adversely affect us and disrupt our operations.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our data, communications, news, sports and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment, and other business processes. Despite our security measures (including, multi-factor authentication, security information and event management and firewalls and testing tools), network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, or malicious or other activities could result in a disruption of our services and operations. These events could also result in, but are not limited to, the improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, including through third parties which receive any of such information on a confidential basis for business purposes and could be subject to any of these events, and damage our reputation or require us to expend significant resources to remedy. The occurrence of any of these events, and the additional regulations relating to this area and the costs related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain insurance to cover losses related to cybersecurity risks, such policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses,\nWe could be adversely affected by labor disputes and legislation and other union activity.\nThe cost of producing and distributing entertainment programming has increased substantially in recent years due to, among other things, the increasing demands of creative talent and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Although we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce such content ourselves, our program suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and on-air and other talent, trade employees, and others, some of whom are subject to these collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 2,000 of our employees and freelance employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. If we or our program suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Failure to renew these agreements, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by causing, among other things, delays in production that lead to declining viewers, a significant disruption of operations, and reductions in the profit margins of our programming and the amounts we can charge advertisers for time. Our stations and RSNs also broadcast certain professional sporting events, and our viewership may be adversely affected by player strikes or lockouts, which could adversely affect our advertising revenues and results of operations. The amounts paid under our sports rights agreements could be negatively impacted by rising professional player salaries, collective bargaining agreements or changes in the league mandated salary caps. Further, any changes in the existing labor laws, including the possible enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act, may further the realization of the foregoing risks.\nThe effects of the economic environment could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe are required to analyze goodwill and certain other intangible assets for impairment. The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill and certain other intangible assets, such as broadcast licenses and customer relationships, for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, with respect to our local sports segment, as a result of the loss of three Distributors, existing Distributors experiencing elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced, in part, by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the then-current economic environment, the COVID-19 pandemic and related uncertainties, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $4,264 million. For additional information regarding impairments to our goodwill and intangible assets, see Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnrelated third parties may bring claims against us based on the nature and content of information posted on websites maintained by us.\nWe host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. Claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nRisks related to our concentrated voting stock ownership\nThe Smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a stockholder vote and may have interests that differ from other security holders. They may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interests of other security holders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, and Robert E. Smith hold shares representing approximately 81.1% of our common stock voting rights and, therefore, control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and approving corporate transactions. The Smiths hold substantially all of the Class B Common Stock, which have ten votes per share. Our Class A Common Stock has only one vote per share. Future transfers by holders of Class B Common Stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A Common Stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B Common Stock who retain their shares in the long term. In addition, the Smiths hold four of our board of directors' seats and, therefore, have the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies. The Smiths have entered into a stockholders' agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote for each other as candidates for election to our board of directors until December 31, 2025.\nAlthough in the past the Smiths have recused themselves from related person transactions, circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Smiths, as the controlling security holders, could be in conflict with the interests of other security holders and the Smiths would have the ability to cause us to take actions in their interest. In addition, the Smiths could pursue acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other security holders. Further, the concentration of ownership the Smiths possess may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.\n(See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, which will be included as part of our Proxy Statement for our 2021 Annual Meeting.)\nSignificant divestitures by the Smiths could cause them to own or control less than 51% of the voting power of our shares, which in turn (i) could, as discussed under A failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans within Item 1A. Risk Factors, under certain circumstances require us to offer to buy back some or all of our outstanding STG and DSG notes and could result in an event of default under each of the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement and (ii) give Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation (Cunningham) the right to terminate the LMAs and other outsourcing agreements with Cunningham due to a \"change in control.\" Any such termination of LMAs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The FCC's multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets. See the risk factor below regarding the FCC's multiple ownership rules.\nRisks relating to our broadcast segment\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control. This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay debt or reduce the market value of our securities.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for a significant portion of our broadcast segment revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate. If we generate less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay debt and meet our debt service obligations, and the value of our business may decline. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u2022the levels of automotive and services advertising, which historically have represented a large portion of our advertising revenue; for the year ended December 31, 2020 (a political year), services and automotive advertising represented 19% and 16%, respectively, of our advertising revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (a non-political year), services and automotive advertising represented 22% and 25%, respectively, of our advertising revenue;\n\u2022the levels of political advertising, which are significantly higher in even-number years and elevated further every four years related to the presidential election (as was the case in 2020), historically have represented a large portion of our advertising revenue; for the year ended December 31, 2020, political advertising represented 27% of our advertising revenue;\n\u2022the levels of political advertising, which are affected by political beliefs, public opinion, campaign finance laws, and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds which are subject to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022the health of the economy in the areas where our television stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022the popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u2022the effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter;\n\u2022the effects of new rating methodologies;\n\u2022changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u2022the financial health of our underlying advertisers' businesses and demand for their products;\n\u2022the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, Distributors, internet and broadband content providers and other print, outdoor, social media, and media outlets serving in the same markets;\n\u2022OTT and other emerging technologies and their potential impact on cord-cutting;\n\u2022the impact of Distributors and OTT distributors offering \"skinny\" programming bundles that may not include all programming of television broadcast stations and/or cable channels, such as Tennis Channel;\n\u2022changes in pricing and sellout levels;\n\u2022the financial health of our underlying customers' that we provide management services to;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our salespeople; and\n\u2022other factors that may be beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe purchase television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues. Actual revenues may be lower than our expectations. If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.\nOne of our stations' most significant costs is network and syndicated programming. Our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities. If a particular network or program is not popular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the cost.\nWe generally purchase syndicated programming content from others rather than producing such content ourselves, therefore, we have limited control over the costs of the programming. Often, we must purchase syndicated programming several years in advance and may have to commit to purchase more than one year's worth of programming. We may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or before we have fully amortized the costs. We also receive programming from networks with which we have network affiliation agreements. Generally, the agreements are for several years. The popularity of networks can affect revenue earned on those channels. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.\nWe internally originate television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues. Actual revenues could fluctuate and may be lower than our expectations. If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.\nThe production of internally originated programming requires a large up-front investment and the revenues derived from the airing of internally originated programming primarily depends upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of original content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.\nWe may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation or program service arrangement with us, we are not able to negotiate arrangements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements, or if networks make programming available through services other than our local affiliates, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenue.\nThe networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each station's commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during programming and for cash fees. The amount and quality of programming provided by each network varies. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a detailed listing of our stations and channels as of December 31, 2020.\nAs network affiliation agreements come up for renewal, we (or licensees of the stations we provide programming and/or sales services to), may not be able to negotiate terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Upon the termination of any of our network affiliation agreements, we would be required to establish a new network affiliation agreement for the affected station with another network or operate as an independent station.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the impact of an increase in reverse network compensation payments, under which we compensate the network for programming pursuant to our affiliation agreements, may have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of current expirations of our affiliation agreements.\nWe may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities, such as, but not limited to penalties related to violations of FCC indecency, children's programming, sponsorship identification, and other FCC rules and policies, the enforcement of which has increased in recent years, and complaints related to such violations may delay our renewal applications with the FCC.\nWe provide a significant amount of live news reporting that is provided by the broadcast networks or is controlled by our on-air news talent. Although both broadcast network and our on-air talent have generally been professional and careful in what they say, there is always the possibility that information may be reported that is inaccurate or even in violation of certain indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. In addition, entertainment and sports programming provided by broadcast syndicators and\nnetworks may contain content that is in violation of the indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. Because the interpretation by the courts and the FCC of the indecency rules is not always clear, it is sometimes difficult for us to determine in advance what may be indecent programming. We have insurance to cover some of the liabilities that may occur, but the FCC has enhanced its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency. Also, the FCC has various rules governing children's television programming, including commercial matter limitations, and sponsorship identification. We are subject to such rules regardless of whether the programming is produced by us or by third parties. Violation of the indecency, children's programming or sponsorship identification rules could potentially subject us to penalties, license revocation, or renewal or qualification proceedings. For example, as described under Litigation within FCC Litigation Matters under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 22, 2020, the FCC released an Order and Consent Decree pursuant to which we agreed to pay $48 million and implement a four year compliance plan to resolve various matters. There can be no assurance that future incidents that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided.\nFrom time to time, we may be the subject of an investigation from governmental authorities. For example, as described more fully under The FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets below. On January 4, 2019, the Company received three CIDs from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ relating to JSAs in a certain DMAs. We believe the DOJ has issued similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. There can be no assurance that an investigation will not lead to an action or proceeding against us. In the event an action or proceeding is commenced, we may be subject to fines, penalties and changes in our business that could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility, which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs.\nThe FCC regulates our broadcast segment, just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry. We must obtain the FCC's approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew, assign or modify a license, purchase a new station, sell an existing station, or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that hold a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our broadcast segment operations; we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner, if at all. If licenses are not renewed or acquisitions are not approved, we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned.\nIn addition, Congress and the FCC may, in the future, adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters (including, but not limited to, technological changes in spectrum assigned to particular services) that could, directly or indirectly, materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties. (See Item 1. Business.)\nThe FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.\nTelevision station ownership\nAs discussed in National Ownership Rule under Ownership Matters under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, in December 2017, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the National Ownership Rule, including the UHF discount, which remains pending. Because we are near the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount, changes to the UHF discount or National Ownership Rule could limit our ability to acquire television stations in additional markets.\nAs discussed in Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, in August 2016, the FCC issued the Ownership Order to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. JSAs that existed prior to March 31, 2014, were allowed to remain in place until October 1, 2025, at which point they must be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the rules. These \"grandfathered\" JSAs could be transferred or assigned without losing grandfathering status. Subsequently, in its Ownership Order on Reconsideration, the FCC eliminated the JSA attribution rule. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration were filed before the Third Circuit, which vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. That decision was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court which granted certiori and heard\noral argument on January 19, 2021. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision remains pending. We have entered into outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs) whereby 34 stations provide various non-programming related services such as sales, operational and managerial services to or by other stations within the same markets. For additional information, refer to Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business. See Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our JSAs which we consolidate as variable interest entities.\nCertain of our stations have entered into LMAs pursuant to which we may provide programming to and sell advertising on a separately owned television station serving the same market. The FCC attributes LMAs to the programmer if the programmer provides more than 15% of a station\u2019s weekly broadcast programming; provided, that, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996, including ours, are currently exempt from attribution. The FCC may review these grandfathered LMAs in the future and if it determines to terminate or modify the grandfathered period and make all LMAs fully attributable we will be required to terminate or modify our grandfathered LMAs unless the FCC\u2019s local ownership rules would permit us to own both stations. As of December 31, 2020, we provide services under grandfathered LMAs to eight television stations owned by third parties. See Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our LMAs which we consolidate as variable interest entities.\nAs discussed in Other Pending Matters under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, in December 2018, the FCC sought comment on whether certain of its ownership rules continue to be necessary in the public interest or whether they should be modified or eliminated. This proceeding remains open. Changes to these rules could result in the need to terminate or modify our LMAs, JSAs and other outsourcing agreements.\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company received three CIDs from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. In each CID, the DOJ requested that the Company produce certain documents and materials relating to JSAs in a specific DMA. We believe the DOJ has issued similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. We are cooperating and are in discussions with the DOJ regarding our response to the CID. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the CID process, including whether it will result in any action or proceeding against us.\nSee Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs, JSAs and other outsourcing agreements, our business could be affected in the following ways:\n\u2022Loss of revenues. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, we would lose some or all of the revenues generated from those arrangements. We would lose revenue because we will have fewer demographic options, a smaller audience distribution and lower revenue share to offer to advertisers.\n\u2022Increased costs. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, our cost structure would increase as we would potentially lose significant operating synergies and we may also need to add new employees. With termination of LMAs, we likely would incur increased programming costs because we will be competing with the separately owned station for syndicated programming.\n\u2022Losses on investments. As part of certain of our arrangements, we own the non-license assets used by the stations with which we have arrangements. If certain of these arrangements are no longer permitted, we would be forced to sell these assets, restructure our agreements or find another use for them. If this happens, the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and, therefore, we cannot be certain of a favorable return on our original investments.\n\u2022Termination penalties. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements before the terms of the arrangements expire, or under certain circumstances, we elect not to extend the terms of the arrangements, we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of certain of our arrangements. Any such termination penalties could be material.\n\u2022Alternative arrangements. If the FCC requires us to terminate the existing arrangements, we may enter into one or more alternative arrangements. Any such arrangements may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than the existing arrangements.\nFailure of owner / licensee to exercise control\nThe FCC requires the owner / licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station. As a result, the owners / licensees of those stations with which we have outsourcing agreements can exert their control in ways that may be counter to our interests, including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances. The preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased under our LMAs and therefore, uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming. In addition, if the FCC determines that the owner / licensee is not exercising sufficient control, it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license. Any one of these scenarios, especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license, might result in a reduction of our cash flow or margins and an increase in our operating costs. In addition, penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses, putting our own licenses at risk.\nThe pendency and indeterminacy of the outcome of these ownership rules and the CIDs, which may limit our ability to provide services to additional or existing stations pursuant to licenses, LMAs, outsourcing agreements or otherwise, expose us to a certain amount of volatility, particularly if the outcomes are adverse to us. Further, resolution of these ownership rules and the CIDs has been and will likely continue to be a cost burden and a distraction to our management and the continued absence of a resolution may have a negative effect on our business.\nWe have invested and will continue to invest in new technology initiatives which may not result in usable technology or intellectual property.\nWe have heavily invested in the development of the NEXTGEN TV platforms as discussed in Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform under Operating Strategy within Item 1. Business. We do not know whether the outcome of our research and development will result in technology that will be usable on our distribution platform or available to license to third parties. Any failure to develop this technology could result in the loss of our investment. Our cost incurred related to the development of the NEXTGEN TV platform is recorded within non-media expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, we have developed, on our own and through joint ventures, several NEXTGEN TV related patents that we will attempt to monetize directly, through third-party agents, or through a patent pool designed to consolidate similar patents owned by independent licensors for licensing to equipment manufacturers. We do not know whether our attempts at monetization will result in licensing arrangements that will be accepted by such equipment manufacturers or result in any royalty payments for our intellectual property rights.\nRisks relating to our local sports segment\nOur media rights agreements with various professional sports teams have varying durations and terms and we may be unable to renew those agreements on acceptable terms or such rights may be lost for other reasons.\nOur ability to generate revenues is dependent upon media rights agreements with professional sports teams. As of December 31, 2020, we had a weighted average remaining life of 10 years under our exclusive media rights agreements. Upon expiration, we may seek renewal of these agreements and, if we do, we may be outbid by competing programming networks or others for these agreements or the renewal costs could substantially exceed our costs under the current agreements. Even if we are to renew such agreements, our results of operations could be adversely affected if increases in sports programming rights costs outpace increases in distribution and advertising revenues. In addition, one or more of these sports teams may seek to establish their own programming network or join one of our competitor's networks or regional sports network and, in certain circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to bid for the media rights. Also, there is a risk that certain rights can be distributed via digital rights and the RSNs would not have the same monetization for such rights.\nMoreover, the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. The governing bodies of the MLB, NBA and NHL have imposed, and may impose in the future, various rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements (collectively, \u201cLeague Rules\u201d), which could have a material negative effect on our business\nand results of operations. For example, the League Rules define the territories in which we may distribute games of the teams in the applicable league. Changes to the League Rules, or the adoption of new League Rules, could affect our media rights agreements with the various teams and as consequence have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the leagues may give digital rights and/or may allocate more games for national feeds to other Distributors, and/or may incentivize team participation in league-controlled sports networks.\nThe value of these media rights can also be affected, or we could lose such rights entirely, if a team is liquidated, undergoes reorganization in bankruptcy or relocates to an area where it is not possible or commercially feasible for us to continue to distribute programming for such team. Any loss or diminution in the value of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by us and could materially negatively affect us and our results of operations. In addition, our affiliation agreements with Distributors typically include certain remedies in the event our networks fail to meet a minimum number of professional event telecasts, and, accordingly, any loss of rights could materially negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur local sports segment\u2019s success depends on distribution revenue we receive, the loss of which or renewal of which on less favorable terms may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur local sports segment\u2019s success is dependent upon the existence and terms of our agreements with Distributors and other OTT distributors. Our existing agreements for our programming networks expire at various dates. Given the relatively short-term nature of our existing agreements, a number of agreements with Distributors are up for renewal and under negotiation at any given time. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renew these distribution agreements or obtain terms as attractive as our existing agreements in the event of a renewal. For example, in recent years, we have been unable to negotiate renewals of distribution agreements on satisfactory terms with three significant Distributors. Our affiliation agreements with Dish Network Corporation (Dish), YouTube TV, and Hulu expired on July 26, 2019, October 1, 2020 and October 23, 2020, respectively. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from Dish and its OTT service, Sling TV, accounted for 12% of the Acquired RSNs distribution revenue. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from YouTube TV and Hulu accounted for a combined 9% of the local sports segment\u2019s distribution revenue. In addition, some of the affiliation agreements also include so-called \"most favored nations\" provisions which require that certain terms (including, potentially, the material terms) of such agreements are no less favorable than those provided to any similarly situated Distributors. If triggered, these most favored nations provisions could cause the amounts earned under these agreements to decrease, which could result in our inability to achieve the originally anticipated benefits of such agreements.\nDistribution revenue constitutes the substantial majority of our local sports segment revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, local sports segment distribution revenue constituted 92% of our local sports segment revenue and 42% of our consolidated total revenue. Changes in distribution revenue generally result from a combination of changes in rates and subscriber counts. As described under If the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to Distributor services increases or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include our programming networks, there may be a material negative effect on our distribution revenue. during the last few years, the number of subscribers to Distributor services in the United States has been declining. We believe the decline has resulted from technological advancements that have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume sports, including through the so-called \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies. Reductions in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss of, or reduction in carriage of, our programming networks, would adversely affect our distribution revenue. For example, Distributors may introduce, market and/or modify tiers of programming networks that could impact the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers of programming that may exclude our networks. Any loss or reduction in carriage would also decrease the potential audience for our programming, which may adversely affect our advertising revenues.\nOur distribution agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the year on our networks. If we were unable to meet these criteria, we could become subject to remedies available to the Distributors, which may include fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements. Our ability to meet these requirements is primarily driven by the delivery of games by the professional sports leagues. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to the normal operations of the professional sports leagues resulting in delays and uncertainty with respect to regularly scheduled games. For example, decisions made by the leagues during the second quarter of 2020 regarding the timing and format of the revised 2020 seasons have resulted, in some cases, in our inability to meet these minimum requirements and the need to reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our distribution customers.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, an existing agreement may expire and we may have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. While Distributors may continue to carry the\nservices in certain of these circumstances until the execution of definitive renewal or replacement agreements (or until we or the Distributor determine that carriage should cease), Distributors may instead elect to stop carrying, or \"blackout,\" the services upon the expiration of an agreement. Whether Distributors continue to carry the services or not during the renegotiation of our agreement with them, an expiration of an existing agreement without a renewal or replacement thereof may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition.\nOccasionally, we may have disputes with Distributors over the terms of our agreements. If not resolved through business discussions, such disputes could result in litigation or actual or threatened termination of an existing agreement.\nIn addition, the pay television industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of Distributors serving a significant percentage of pay television subscribers that receive our programming networks, thereby affording the largest Distributors significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks, including us. A substantial majority of our local sports segment distribution revenue comes from our top three Distributors. Further consolidation in the industry could reduce the number of Distributors available to distribute our programming networks and increase the negotiating leverage of certain Distributors, which could adversely affect our revenue. In some cases, if a Distributor is acquired, the distribution agreement of the acquiring Distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a Distributor that is a party to one or more distribution agreements with us on terms that are more favorable to us than that of the acquirer could have a material negative impact on us and our results of operations.\nOur joint venture arrangements are subject to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have invested in a number of our RSNs through joint ventures with certain teams, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we were joint venture partners with six teams in the RSNs that distribute content for each respective team. The nature of the joint ventures requires us to consult with and share certain decision-making powers with unaffiliated third parties. Further, differences in economic or business interests or goals among joint venture participants could result in delayed decisions, failures to agree on major issues and even litigation. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business or strategic plans, or if our joint venture partners take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, our results could be adversely affected.\nOur participation in joint ventures is also subject to the risks that:\n\u2022we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes.\n\u2022we may not be able to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners, which could limit our future growth potential and could have an adverse effect on our business strategies.\n\u2022our joint venture partners could have investment or operational goals that are not consistent with our corporate-wide objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for investments or future growth opportunities.\n\u2022our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations as joint venture partners, which could cause us to decide to infuse our own capital into any such venture on behalf of the related joint venture partner or partners despite other competing uses for such capital.\n\u2022some of our existing joint ventures require mandatory capital expenditures for the benefit of the applicable joint venture, which could limit our ability to expend funds on other corporate opportunities.\n\u2022some of our joint venture partners have exit rights that require us to purchase their interests upon the occurrence of certain events or the passage of certain time periods, which could impact our financial condition by requiring us to incur additional debt in order to complete such transactions or otherwise use cash that could have been spent on alternative investments.\n\u2022our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.\n\u2022any sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets of the joint venture may require consents from our joint venture partners, which we may not be able to obtain.\n\u2022certain corporate-wide or strategic transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner (including termination or liquidation rights) depending on how the transaction is structured, which could impact our ability to complete such transactions.\nOur local sports segment is substantially dependent on the popularity of the MLB, NBA and NHL teams whose media rights we control.\nOur local sports segment is dependent on the popularity of the MLB, NBA and NHL teams whose local media rights we control and, in varying degrees, those teams achieving on-field, on-court and on-ice success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in increased viewership and advertising revenues. Furthermore, success in the regular season may qualify a team for participation in the post-season, which generates increased interest in such team, thereby improving viewership and advertising revenues. Alternatively, if a team declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm, this may negatively impact viewership and advertising revenues and the terms on which our affiliation agreements are renewed. There can be no assurance that any sports team will generate or maintain fan enthusiasm or compete in post-season play, and the failure to do so could result in a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control, which volatility may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for a portion of our local sports segment revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u2022the success of the automotive and service industries, which historically have provided a significant portion of our local sports segment advertising revenue;\n\u2022the health of the economy in the areas where our networks are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022the popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u2022the popularity of the sports teams with which we own rights;\n\u2022the effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter;\n\u2022the effects of new rating methodologies;\n\u2022changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our networks are located;\n\u2022the financial health of our underlying advertisers' businesses and demand for their products;\n\u2022the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as radio stations, Distributors, internet and broadband content providers and other print, outdoor, social media, Internet and media outlets serving in the same markets;\n\u2022OTT and other emerging technologies and their potential impact on cord-cutting;\n\u2022the impact of Distributors and other OTT providers not offering our networks or offering \"skinny\" programming bundles that may not include all programming of our networks;\n\u2022changes in pricing and sellout levels;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales people;\n\u2022our ability to compete with Distributors that are selling the advertising time that we provide them, which they are able to bundle with other sports and other geographic locations;\n\u2022advertisers' desire to message to our viewer demographic;\n\u2022our ability to successfully implement a DTC and gamification strategy;\n\u2022our ability to successfully rebrand the RSNs;\n\u2022Bally's ability to pay for naming rights and advertising commitments, as well as successfully increase the value of their company;\n\u2022the effectiveness of the RSNs digital APP and ability to monetize impressions; and\n\u2022other factors that may be beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on us, our financial condition, or our results of operations.\nWe may be obligated to make certain payments to local teams during labor disputes.\nWe may be impacted by union relations of professional sports leagues. Each of the NBA, the NHL and MLB has experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues, such as players' strikes or management lockouts, in the future. For example, the NBA has experienced labor difficulties, including lockouts during the 1998-99 and 2011-12 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case. The NHL has also experienced labor difficulties, including lockouts during the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case, and a lockout beginning in September 2004, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 NHL season. MLB has also experienced labor difficulties, including players' strikes during the 1972, 1981 and 1994 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case, and the loss of the entire post-season and the World Series in 1994.\nAny labor disputes between professional sports leagues and players' unions may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games for which we have the rights to broadcast, resulting in decreased revenues, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations. In addition, any labor disputes between professional sports leagues and players' unions may result in us having to broadcast games with substitute players, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations. Although many of our current programming rights agreements with local teams account for labor disputes with certain pro rata reductions in the rights fees owed thereunder, we have a contractual obligation in some cases to continue paying a certain portion of such rights fees notwithstanding any labor dispute.\nWe may need to obtain FCC-regulated licenses for RSN video distribution.\nOur RSNs require use of certain uplinks and downlink facilities for video distribution. Such facilities are licensed by the FCC and subject to FCC regulations. We do not currently own any such authorizations and have entered a transition services agreement whereby a third party, as the FCC-licensee of existing uplink and downlink licenses, provides services related to these authorizations. Upon termination or expiration of the transition services agreement, we may need to acquire such authorizations from the current licensee or obtain new authorizations. In either case, we would need to apply for and obtain prior FCC consent. From time to time, the FCC places limits or holds on applications related to such authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant our applications.\nRisks relating to our debt\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have a high level of debt, totaling $12,551 million at December 31, 2020, compared to the book value of shareholders' deficit of $1,185 million on the same date.\nOur high level of debt poses risks, including the following risks, particularly in periods of declining revenues:\n\u2022we may be unable to service our debt obligations, especially during negative economic, financial credit and market industry conditions;\n\u2022we may require a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, especially during negative economic and market industry conditions;\n\u2022the amount available for joint ventures, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes may be limited because a significant portion of cash flow is used to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt;\n\u2022if our distribution and advertising revenues decline, we may not be able to service our debt;\n\u2022if we are unable to renew team sports media rights or renew on less favorable terms, we may not be able to service our debt;\n\u2022our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future joint ventures, working capital needs, additional acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022rating agencies may downgrade our corporate family rating and/or debt ratings which could impair our ability to raise funds, refinance debt, or incur a higher financing cost;\n\u2022the cost to borrow from lenders may increase or market rates may increase;\n\u2022our ability to access the capital markets may be limited, and we may be unable to issue securities with pricing or other terms that we find attractive, if at all;\n\u2022if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to restructure or refinance our debt or sell an equity interest in one or more of our RSNs to reduce debt service obligations;\n\u2022we may be limited in our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus, less able to withstand competitive pressures; and\n\u2022we may not be able to comply with debt service requirements or other financial and affirmative and negative covenants.\nAny of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment, repay, restructure or refinance our debt, seek additional debt or equity capital, make capital improvements or to respond to events that would enhance profitability.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of equity interests in our RSNs, other material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our debt. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The STG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, the A/R Facility, and each of the indentures that govern the STG and DSG notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions and restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other debt when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, and the A/R Facility could terminate their commitments to loan us money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their obligations and we, STG and/or DSG could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite our current level of debt, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described herein.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future. Although the terms of the debt instruments to which we are subject contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face could intensify.\nOur variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the obligations under the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, the A/R Facility, or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $5,839 million principal amount of our debt relates to the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, and the A/R Facility, in each case subject to variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate debt would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our debt, would correspondingly decrease.\nCommitments we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities and business or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities and business.\nOur existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests. These restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult to repay unsecured debt or decrease the value of our securities and business. These restrictions and tests include the following:\n\u2022restrictions on the incurrence, assumption or guaranteeing of additional debt, or the issuance of disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to guarantee and pledge our assets as security for debt;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to prepay or redeem certain debt;\n\u2022restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to our capital stock;\n\u2022restrictions on some sales of certain assets and the use of proceeds from asset sales;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions, satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without the consent of bank lenders;\n\u2022restrictions on permitted investments;\n\u2022restrictions on the lines of business we and our subsidiaries may operate; and\n\u2022financial ratio and condition tests including, the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, the ratio of first lien debt to consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, to fixed charges.\nFuture financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests. In addition, the limited liability company agreement governing the terms of the preferred equity of Diamond Sports Holdings LLC (DSH), an indirect parent of DSG and one of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, that we issued in connection with the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs (Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity), restricts DSH\u2019s and its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and make distributions relating to its capital stock, and future issuances of equity by DSH. All of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies, prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities.\nIn addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations (particularly if the economy weakens and thereby reduces our advertising revenues). If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this happens, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actions that could significantly reduce the value of our securities and business and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations.\nA failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans.\nCertain of our debt agreements will contain cross-default provisions with other debt, which means that a default under certain of our debt instruments may cause a default under such other debt. As of December 31, 2020, a default under the DSG notes or DSG Bank Credit Agreement would not trigger a cross-default under the STG Bank Credit Agreement or the STG notes, or vice versa. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, a default under the A/R Facility would not trigger a default under the terms of any of our other debt.\nIf we breach certain of our debt covenants, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately take possession of the property securing such debt. In addition, if any other debtholder of either STG or DSG were to declare its loan due and payable as a result of a default, the holders of the respective debt of STG (STG Bank Credit Agreement and STG notes) or DSG (DSG Bank Credit Agreement, DSG notes, and the A/R Facility), might be able to require us to pay those debts immediately.\nAs a result, any default under debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet our obligations.\nThe total assets, net income and attributable EBITDA of our subsidiary guarantors of the DSG notes may decrease substantially if our existing subsidiary guarantors cease to be wholly-owned as a result of the issuance of equity of the subsidiaries to third parties.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are joint venture partners with six teams in the RSNs that distribute content for each respective team. In connection with our efforts to renew our existing media rights agreements, we may enter into new agreements that provide our joint venture partners or other investors a minority equity interest in the RSNs that are currently wholly-owned. Such RSNs would not be wholly-owned by us, and because the indentures that govern the DSG notes only requires wholly-owned subsidiaries to guarantee the DSG notes, such RSNs would no longer be required to guarantee the DSG notes. As a result, the total assets, net income and attributable EBITDA of our non-guarantor subsidiaries could increase substantially, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under the DSG notes.\nOur joint venture agreements contain provisions which may result in cash payments that would reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our debt.\nOur joint venture agreements contain certain provisions which may result in cash payments that would decrease our available cash and may reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our debt.\nFor example, as of December 31, 2020, our joint venture agreements with three teams contained provisions by which we were or may become contractually obligated, at the team's option, to purchase a portion of or all of the team's equity interest in the joint venture at a pre-determined price. If additional teams exercise their put rights pursuant to the joint venture agreements, it would require us to make cash payments that would decrease our available cash and may reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our debt, including the DSG notes.\nGeneral risk factors\nFinancial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our industry, business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Poor economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive industry and service businesses, each of which is a significant source of our advertising revenue. Additionally, financial institutions, capital providers, or other consumers may be adversely affected. Potential consequences of any financial and economic decline include:\n\u2022the financial condition of those companies that advertise on our stations, sports networks, and digital platforms, including, among others, the automobile manufacturers and dealers, may be adversely affected and could result in a significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u2022our ability to pursue the divestiture of certain assets at attractive values may be limited;\n\u2022the possibility that our business partners, such as counterparties to our outsourcing and news share arrangements and parties to joint ventures with the RSNs, could be negatively impacted and our ability to maintain these business relationships could also be impaired;\n\u2022our ability to refinance our existing debt on terms and at interest rates we find attractive, if at all, may be impaired;\n\u2022our ability to make certain capital expenditures may be significantly impaired;\n\u2022our ability to pursue the acquisition of attractive assets may be limited if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional capital on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022content providers may cut back on the amount of content we can acquire to program the RSNs or stations; and\n\u2022the possibility of our distribution customers losing subscribers, thereby impacting our distribution revenues.", "PERMNO": 81740, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "SBGI"}
