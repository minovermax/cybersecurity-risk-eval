RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Strategy\n\u2022Our financial condition and results of operations could be further adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our existing tests or develop new tests to be profitable.\n\u2022We may not be able to maintain revenue growth or operate our business on a profitable basis, and our transformation plan may not achieve the anticipated results.\n\u2022If we do not continue to generate sufficient revenue from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and are unable to secure additional funding, we may have to reduce our operations.\n\u2022An inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, including key management personnel, could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We are subject to debt covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and if we are not able to comply with them, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity.\n\u2022If our current operating plan changes and we find that our existing capital resources will not meet our needs, we may find it necessary to raise additional funding, which may not be available.\n\u2022We may acquire technologies, assets or other businesses that could cause us to incur significant expense and expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\n\u2022We are currently subject to, and in the future may be subject to, securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions, as well as product or professional liability claims. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\n\u2022Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions, including from cyberattacks, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\n\u2022If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, including security breaches, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our business involves environmental risks that may result in liability for us.\n\u2022Changes in health care policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our tests.\n\u2022Ethical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.\n\u2022We rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport biological materials to our facilities in a timely and cost-efficient manner and if these delivery services are disrupted, our business will be harmed.\n\u2022We face risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Tests, Our Services and Test Candidates\n\u2022Our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests in development may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\n\u2022If we do not compete effectively with scientific and commercial competitors, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our tests, increase our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.\n\u2022Our international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\n\u2022Foreign governments may impose reimbursement standards, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\n\u2022Domestic and international data protection laws and regulations may restrict our activities and increase our costs.\n\u2022Each of our molecular diagnostic tests is processed in a single one of our laboratory facilities, and any loss or prolonged interruption of our ability to use these laboratories or failure to maintain their operation in compliance with applicable regulations would seriously harm our business.\n\u2022We depend on a limited number of third parties for some of our supplies of equipment and reagents. If these supplies become unavailable or are disrupted, including as a result of COVID-19 and responses to it, then we may not be able to successfully perform our research or operate our business on a timely basis or at all.\n\u2022If our current research collaborators or scientific advisors terminate their relationships with us or develop relationships with a competitor, our ability to discover genes, proteins, and biomarkers, and to validate and commercialize molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022If we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business.\n\u2022If we were sued for patent infringement by third parties, we might incur significant costs and delays in test introduction.\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets, proprietary databases, and other proprietary information.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we could lose license rights that are critical to our business.\n\u2022We may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\u2022If we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\u2022If the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate payment for our existing and future tests, if any, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed.\n\u2022FDA regulation of our industry generally or our tests specifically could be disruptive to our business.\n\u2022Failure to comply with laws and regulations related to submission of claims for our services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and corresponding foreign reimbursement programs.\n\u2022We may from time to time be subject to government investigation(s), the unfavorable outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Our business could be harmed by the loss, suspension, or other restriction on a license, certification, or accreditation, or by the imposition of a fine or penalties, under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or other state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting licensure or certification, or by future changes in these laws or regulations.\n\u2022Changes in the way that the FDA regulates tests performed by laboratories like ours could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future.\n\u2022Companion and complementary diagnostic tests require FDA approval and we may not be able to secure such approval in a timely manner or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price is highly volatile, and our stock may lose all or a significant part of its value.\n\u2022We have identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our income tax provision process and our general information technology controls and such weaknesses led to a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. Our inability to remediate these material weaknesses, our discovery of any additional weaknesses, or our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in us.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and re-adoption of our stockholders\u2019 rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\n\u2022We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\u2022Our restated bylaws provide that a state court located within the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Strategy\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be further adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nAny outbreaks of COVID-19 (including its variant strains, such as the highly transmissible Omicron and Delta variants) or any other outbreak of contagious disease or adverse public health development, could have a further material and adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, government public health officials have implemented, and may continue to implement restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has limited, and may continue to limit, patients\u2019 access to our services, and has caused, and may continue to cause, patients to elect to defer certain testing, each of which has impeded, and may continue to impede, our progress in returning to profitability and recovering from the earlier effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such adverse effects have included, and may continue to include, diversion or prioritization of health care resources away from the conduct of genetic testing, disruptions, or restrictions affecting the ability of laboratories to process our tests, and delays or difficulties in patients accessing our tests. Future surges in COVID-19 cases and related employee absences may strain our workforce and impact our ability to process tests in a timely way due to reduced staff availability. In addition, failure to comply with potential federal or state regulations requiring us to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for our employees could result in our losing access to government funding or facing monetary penalties.\nAs COVID-19 continues to affect individuals and businesses around the globe, we will likely experience further disruptions from time to time that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u2022decreased volume of testing as a result of disruptions to health care providers and limitations on the ability of providers to administer tests, including the suspension of non-emergency appointments and services;\n\u2022disruptions or restrictions on the ability of our customers, our collaborators\u2019, or our suppliers\u2019 personnel to travel, including as a result of shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders from state and local governments, and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u2022limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the development of our products, processing our diagnostic tests, and the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or requirements imposed on employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or access.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could continue to adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chain. Parts of our direct and indirect supply chain are located overseas and both international and domestic components have been, and may continue to be, subject to disruption as a result of COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it. If the supplies and components necessary to manufacture our products become unavailable or are disrupted as a result of COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it, then we may not be able to successfully perform our research, sell our diagnostic tests, or operate our business on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the continued spread of COVID-19 or any other public health emergency harms our business or the economy in general either domestically or in any other region in which we do business.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 continues to affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and impede our recovery from the earlier effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, spread and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks, the rate of vaccination and efficacy of approved vaccines against COVID-19 and its variant strains, actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, new information that may emerge concerning the health effects of COVID-19, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions would resume if the pandemic subsided, any of which could have a further adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including from increased inflation and the prospect that policy responses to inflation could delay economic recovery or lead to another recession.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our existing tests or develop new tests to be profitable.\nWe believe our future success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market our existing molecular diagnostic tests to additional patients within the United States, to expand into new markets within and outside the United States, and to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests. However, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our existing tests and launching and commercializing our new tests to be profitable. The demand for our existing molecular diagnostic tests may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates due to sales of new tests that may replace or cannibalize our existing product portfolio, or for other reasons such as the introduction of competing molecular diagnostic testing products by competitors. For example, because most of our molecular diagnostic tests are only utilized once per patient, we will need to sell our services through physicians to new patients or develop new molecular diagnostic tests in order to continue to generate revenue. Our average reimbursement rate per test may also decline, which may cause our revenues to decrease. Our pipeline of new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic test candidates is in various stages of development, some of which may take many more years to develop, and must undergo extensive clinical validation. We may be unable to discover or develop any additional molecular diagnostic or companion diagnostic tests through the utilization of our technologies or technologies we license or acquire from others. Even if we develop tests or services for commercial use, we may not be able to develop tests or services that:\n\u2022meet applicable regulatory standards, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022successfully compete with other technologies and tests;\n\u2022avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022are adequately reimbursed by third-party payors;\n\u2022can be performed at commercial levels or at reasonable cost; or\n\u2022can be successfully marketed.\nWe must generate significant revenue to achieve profitability. Even if we succeed in marketing our existing molecular diagnostic tests to physicians for use in new patients and in developing and commercializing any additional molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue and we may not be profitable.\nWe may not be able to maintain revenue growth or operate our business on a profitable basis, and our transformation plan may not achieve the anticipated results.\nWe may not be able to generate revenue growth or maintain existing revenue levels. Historically, our molecular diagnostic business has operated profitably providing a cash contribution to our funding and operational needs. We may not, however, be able to operate our molecular diagnostic business on a profitable basis in the future. Potential events or factors that may have a significant impact on our ability to sustain revenue growth and achieve or maintain profitability for our molecular diagnostic business include the following:\n\u2022the efforts of third-party payors to limit or decrease the amounts that they are willing to pay for our tests, recoup amounts already paid, or institute burdensome administrative requirements for reimbursement, such as prior authorization requirements;\n\u2022increased costs of reagents and other consumables required for molecular diagnostic testing;\n\u2022increased personnel and facility costs;\n\u2022our inability to hire competent, trained staff, including laboratory directors required to review and approve all reports we issue in our molecular diagnostic business, and sales personnel;\n\u2022our inability to obtain necessary equipment or reagents to perform molecular diagnostic testing;\n\u2022our inability to increase production capacity as demand increases;\n\u2022our inability to expand into new markets within or outside the United States;\n\u2022increased licensing or royalty costs, and our ability to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our tests and services;\n\u2022changes in intellectual propriety law applicable to our patents or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022potential obsolescence of our tests;\n\u2022our inability to increase commercial acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022increased competition and loss of market share;\n\u2022increased regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022material litigation costs and judgments.\nWe are currently executing upon a strategic transformation plan, which, among other things, is focused on developing and enhancing best-in-class products to support growth, improving the patient and provider experience, and reaching more patients of all backgrounds. In addition, as part of that transformation plan, we intend to accelerate growth through the launch of a new enterprise commercial model, the launch of a unified ordering portal, investment in new sequencing technologies, the development of direct-to-consumer channels, and building commercial capabilities to support new products and offerings. Our future performance and growth depends on the success of our transformation plan, including management's ability to execute upon that plan and the ability of our employees to respond quickly and effectively to transformational projects and rapid changes in our operations and business practices. The implementation of our transformation plan has resulted and is expected to continue to result in changes to business priorities and operations, capital allocation priorities, operational and organizational structures, and increased demands on management. The execution of our transformation plan may take longer than anticipated, and once implemented, we may not realize, in full or part, the anticipated benefits, including growth in our testing volumes and revenue, or such benefits may be realized more slowly than anticipated. The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, delays in the implementation of the transformation plan, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the molecular diagnostics industry, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the other risk factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we do not continue to generate sufficient revenue from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and are unable to secure additional funding, we may have to reduce our operations.\nWhile we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and in certain circumstances, amounts available for borrowing under our Amended Facility (as defined below) will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future, changes could occur that would consume available capital resources more quickly than we currently expect and we may need or want to raise additional financing.\nOn December 23, 2016, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility as borrower, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, which was amended on July 31, 2018, May 1, 2020 and February 22, 2021 (the \"Amended Facility\"). On July 30, 2021, using cash generated from our recent divestitures, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Amended Facility.\nThe Amended Facility restricts our ability to make future borrowings if unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities exceed $150.0 million, unless such borrowings are used in connection with certain permitted acquisitions. Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $398.8 million as of December 31, 2021. Our revolving commitment amount is $250.0 million as of December 31, 2021. As our total unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities exceeded $150.0 million as of December 31, 2021, we will be unable to make future borrowings unless related to a permitted acquisition. In addition, following the expiration of the waiver of the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants, which waiver is effective until March 31, 2022, our ability to borrow under the Amended Facility will be limited if we are unable to comply with those financial covenants.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we are subject to financial covenants as part of our Amended Facility that could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our sales and marketing activities, research and development activities, or other operations, and potentially delay development of our diagnostic tests in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals could be adversely affected.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and cost of development, clinical testing and pre-market studies of any new molecular diagnostic tests that we may discover or acquire;\n\u2022the progress, results, and costs to develop additional molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022our ability to operate our business on a profitable basis;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our current issued patents, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022our ability to enter into collaborations, licensing or other arrangements favorable to us;\n\u2022the costs of acquiring technologies or businesses, and our ability to successfully integrate and achieve the expected benefits of our business development activities and acquisitions;\n\u2022the progress, cost and results of our international efforts;\n\u2022the costs of expanding our sales and marketing functions and commercial operation facilities in the United States and in new markets;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of any litigation against us; and\n\u2022the costs to satisfy our current and future obligations.\nAn inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, including key management personnel, could adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel, including key management personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for management, sales, scientific, medical, information technology, research and development and other technical personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel among life science and technology businesses as well as universities and public and private research institutions, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have office and laboratory facilities. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our agreements with our employees generally provide for employment that can be terminated by either party without cause at any time, subject to specified notice requirements. Further, the non-competition provision that certain key employees are subject to may not be enforceable under certain state, particularly California, or federal laws or such provisions may be prohibitively expensive to enforce. Competition and compensation for highly qualified and experienced personnel increased as employment vacancies surged over the past year, which has increased the difficulty and cost of hiring and retaining qualified personnel. Our transformation and commercial activities have placed a greater workload and strain on our existing employees, increasing the risk that our employees experience fatigue or burnout or terminate their employment with us. Potential federal or state regulations may require us to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for our employees, or any future decision on our part to voluntarily require our employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, could also impact our ability to hire and retain employees. In addition, inflation has had, and we expect that it will continue to have, an impact on the costs that we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain such personnel.\nOur success also depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team, who are critical to directing and managing our growth and development in the future. The loss of any member of our senior management team may cause us to experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies, and implementing our business strategies. Furthermore, the loss of the services of or failure to recruit key scientific and technical personnel and other qualified personnel who are necessary to operate our business would adversely affect our molecular diagnostic business and it may have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole.\nWe are subject to debt covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and if we are not able to comply with them, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity.\nCovenants in the Amended Facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may prohibit or place limitations on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create certain types of liens, and complete mergers, consolidations, or change in control transactions. Under the Amended Facility, a change in control of the Company, which means that a stockholder or a group of stockholders is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Company, would require mandatory prepayment of any outstanding debt. The Amended Facility may also prohibit or place limitations on our ability to sell assets, pay dividends or provide other distributions to stockholders. These restrictions could also limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities.\nWe must maintain specified leverage and interest ratios measured as of the end of each applicable quarter as financial covenants in the Amended Facility. The Amended Facility, through Amendment No. 2 entered into on May 1, 2020 and Amendment No. 3 entered into on February 22, 2021, modified compliance with the leverage covenant and the interest coverage ratio covenant, which were waived through March 31, 2022, and added a minimum liquidity covenant. If we are unable to improve our results of operations, it is possible that we could be in violation of certain financial covenants contained in the Amended Facility in the future. If we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratio in the Amended Facility, we may be in default under the agreement. A default would result in an increase in the rate of interest and limits on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness and it could potentially cause any loan repayment to be accelerated, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity.\nIf our current operating plan changes and we find that our existing capital resources will not meet our needs, we may find it necessary to raise additional funding, which may not be available.\nWe anticipate that our existing capital resources and expected net cash to be generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for the foreseeable future. However, we base this expectation on our current operating plan, which may change. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs in the discovery, development and marketing of current and prospective molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests. Our ongoing efforts to develop tests and expand our business, which may be through internally developed products, partnerships, in-licensing and mergers and acquisitions, will require substantial cash resources. If, due to changes in our current operating plan, adequate funds are not available, we may be required to raise additional funds. Sources of potential additional capital resources may include, but are not limited to, public or private equity financings, expanding or supplementing our Amended Facility, or selling convertible or non-convertible debt securities. This additional funding, if necessary, may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we issue shares of stock or other securities to acquire new companies or technologies, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted.\nBecause of our potential long-term capital requirements, we may access the public or private equity or debt markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, we currently qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer, or WKSI, and can at any time file a registration statement registering securities to be sold to the public which would become effective upon filing. If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or tests or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe may acquire technologies, assets or other businesses that could cause us to incur significant expense and expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nIn addition to organic growth, we intend to continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of technology, assets or other businesses that may enable us to enhance our technologies and capabilities, expand our geographic market and sales channels, add experienced management personnel and increase our test offerings. However, these acquisitions may not achieve profitability or generate a positive return on our investment. Additionally, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates, reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate personnel or assets that we acquire or for other reasons. We may also experience increased expenses, distraction of our management, and personnel and customer uncertainty. Our acquisition efforts may involve certain risks, including:\n\u2022we may have difficulty integrating operations and systems;\n\u2022key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022we may not be successful in launching new molecular diagnostic tests or companion diagnostic tests, or if those tests are launched, they may not prove successful in the marketplace;\n\u2022we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting;\n\u2022we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, including for legal, compliance, recoupment, and environmental-related costs and liabilities, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;\n\u2022we may incur significant additional operating expenses;\n\u2022we may experience inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures;\n\u2022we may encounter risks and limitations on our ability to consolidate our corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and\n\u2022we may not be able to realize synergies, the cost savings or other financial and operational benefits we anticipated, or such synergies, savings or benefits may take longer than we expected.\nThe process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired tests, services, technologies, personnel or businesses might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. Moreover, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as increase in our scale, diversification, cash flows and operational efficiency and meaningful accretion to our diluted earnings per share. Future acquisitions could result in the use of our available cash and marketable securities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the need to incur additional debt, contingent liabilities, or impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, tests or technologies effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may also seek to divest assets from time to time, including but not limited to, large capital equipment, diagnostic tests, intellectual property, business units, or corporate affiliates. The prices that we receive we are able to command for such assets may not be high and, in some cases, may be lower than the amount we invested in or paid for such assets.\nWe are currently subject to, and in the future may be subject to, securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions, as well as product or professional liability claims. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nWe are currently subject to a variety of litigation, including a securities class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and stockholder derivative actions filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, each of which could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business. We also may be subject to future securities class action and stockholder derivative claims, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nIn addition, the marketing, sale and use of our genetic tests could subject us to liability for errors in, misunderstandings of, or inappropriate reliance on, information we provide to clinicians, geneticists or patients, and lead to claims against us if someone were to allege that a test failed to perform as it was designed or marketed, if we failed to provide a correct test result to a patient, if we failed to correctly interpret the test results, if we failed to update the test results due to a reclassification of the variants according to new published guidelines, or if the ordering physician or patient were to misinterpret test results or improperly rely on them when making a clinical decision. We could also be subject to claims, lawsuits or liability if the biological materials we receive for analysis were not properly attributed to the correct patient or if we failed to maintain custody of or properly track the biological materials. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain liability insurance for certain claims, including for errors and omissions, we cannot assure you that such insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. Any liability claim, including an errors and omissions liability claim, brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. If we were successfully sued for product or professional liability claims, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage and our other resources. Additionally, any liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our tests. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions, including from cyberattacks, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information, including that of our customers, payors and collaboration partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site, remote, or cloud-based systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or viruses, malware, including ransomware, breaches or interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such malicious cyberattack, virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, held for ransom, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to prevent, and if necessary, to detect and respond to such cybersecurity incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. While we have experienced unauthorized accesses to our information technology systems and infrastructure in the past, which may occur again in the future, our security measures have been able to detect, respond to and prevent any material adverse effect to our information systems and business operations from such breaches. However, in the future, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, government enforcement actions and civil or even criminal penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process samples, provide test results, bill payors or patients, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, and manage various general and administrative aspects of our business, and may damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we face increased cybersecurity risks and potential disruption to our technology infrastructure due to the number of employees that are working remotely as a result of remote work policies and other hybrid work arrangements. Increased levels of remote access create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities, and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, including security breaches, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nInformation technology and communication systems are an important part of our business operations. These IT and communications systems support a variety of functions, including sample processing, tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing, research and development activities, and various general and administrative activities. The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communication systems. Our information technology and communication systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Our information technology and communication systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology and communication systems that involve our interactions with customers, providers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\nOur business involves environmental risks that may result in liability for us.\nIn connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, including hazardous materials, biological specimens, chemicals and waste. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of controlled materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have.\nChanges in health care policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our tests.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively called the ACA, became law. This law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private third-party payors and continues to significantly impact our business and operations in ways we cannot currently predict. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result, certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or were effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA\u2019s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. Future changes or additions to the ACA or the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, or changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. Further, if reimbursement levels are inadequate, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the ACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and private third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual health care benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from governmental agencies or private third-party payors. Any future changes to legal or regulatory requirements or new cost containment initiatives could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nEthical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy rights and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use, or clinicians to be reluctant to order, genomic tests even if permissible; they may also refuse genetic testing due to concerns regarding eligibility for life or other insurance. Ethical and social concerns may also influence U.S. and foreign patent offices and courts with regard to patent protection for technology relevant to our business. Although the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act has criminalized the disallowance of health insurance on the basis of genetic information, modification or retraction of this federal law could dramatically reduce public demand for genetic testing. These and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport biological materials to our facilities in a timely and cost-efficient manner and if these delivery services are disrupted, our business will be harmed.\nOur core business depends on our ability to quickly and reliably deliver test results to our customers. We typically receive biological material for analysis at our laboratory facilities within days of collection from the patient. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to errors by the courier service, labor disruptions, bad weather, natural disasters, terrorist acts or threats or other reasons, some of which we have experienced in the past, could adversely affect specimen integrity, our ability to process or store samples in a timely manner and to service our customers, and ultimately our reputation and our business. In addition, if we are unable to continue to obtain expedited delivery services on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe receive a portion of our revenues and pay a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar, such as the Euro, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. As a result, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such foreign currencies and the United States dollar, which could affect the results of our operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenues and operating expenses. We may not be able to offset adverse foreign currency impact with increased revenues. We do not currently utilize hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk and even if we were to implement hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Tests, Our Services and Test Candidates\nOur molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests in development may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nWe may not succeed in achieving significant commercial market acceptance of our diagnostic test offerings that we have launched in recent years or are currently developing. Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our current molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests, as well as any future molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that we may develop, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical utility of our tests and their potential advantages over existing tests;\n\u2022our ability to collaborate with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for their therapeutic drugs and drug candidates;\n\u2022the agreement by third-party payors to reimburse our tests, the scope and extent of which will affect patients\u2019 willingness or ability to pay for our tests and will likely heavily influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend our tests; and\n\u2022the willingness of physicians to utilize our tests, which can be difficult to interpret. This difficulty is caused by the ability of our tests to predict only as to a probability, not certainty, that a tested individual will develop the disease, will benefit from a particular therapy or has an aggressive form of the disease that the test is intended to predict.\nThese factors present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our tests, which we would have to spend substantial time and money to overcome, if we can do so at all. Our inability to successfully do so would harm our business.\nIf we do not compete effectively with scientific and commercial competitors, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our tests, increase our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.\nThe clinical laboratory and genetics testing fields are intense, highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, reimbursement challenges, emerging competition, intellectual property disputes and litigation, price competition, aggressive marketing practices, evolving industry standards, and changing customer preferences. Our competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, major diagnostic companies, reference laboratories, molecular diagnostic firms, direct-to-consumer genetic companies, low-priced competitors, clinical laboratories, universities and other research institutions. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration, better selling and marketing capabilities, more experience with third-party payors and considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which may allow these competitors to discover important genes and determine their function before we do, respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their tests than we do, sell their tests at prices designed to win significant levels of market share, or obtain reimbursement from more third-party payors and at higher prices than we do. We could be adversely affected if we do not discover genes, proteins or biomarkers and characterize their function, develop molecular diagnostic tests based on these discoveries, obtain required regulatory and other approvals and launch these tests and their related services before our competitors. We may also not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in our industry, or properly leverage new technologies to achieve or sustain competitive advantages in our tests, systems and processes. We also expect to encounter significant competition with respect to any molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that we may develop or commercialize. Those companies that bring to market new molecular diagnostic and companion tests before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage in marketing and commercializing their tests. We may not be able to develop additional molecular diagnostic tests successfully and we or our licensors may not obtain or enforce patents covering these tests that provide protection against our competitors.\nMoreover, our competitors may succeed in developing molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that circumvent our technologies or tests. Furthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing technologies or tests that are more effective or less costly than those developed by us or that would render our technologies or tests less competitive or obsolete. Increased competition and cost-saving initiatives on the part of governmental entities and third-party payors are likely to result in pricing pressures, which could harm our sales, profitability or ability to gain market share. We expect competition to intensify in the fields in which we are involved as technical advances in these fields occur and become more widely known and changes in intellectual property laws generate challenges to our intellectual property position.\nOur international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nAs part of our business strategy, we operate in international markets. Although we recently narrowed our international operations, we have active sales operations in Germany, France, and Japan and production operations in Germany. We may establish additional operations or acquire additional properties outside the United States in order to advance our international sales. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, data and privacy laws such as the EU GDPR, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022failure by us to obtain regulatory approvals or adequate reimbursement for the use of our tests in various countries;\n\u2022ineffective marketing campaigns leading to failure in establishing a viable, profitable, and sustainable presence in our international markets;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors and self-pay systems;\n\u2022complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022logistics and regulations associated with shipping patient samples, including infrastructure conditions, customs and transportation delays, including compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control and other international trade sanctions;\n\u2022limits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to process tests locally;\n\u2022financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, UK Bribery Act, anti-boycott laws and other anti-corruption laws; and\n\u2022risks related to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our international operations and, consequently, our revenues and results of operations. In addition, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nOur international operations could be affected by changes in laws, trade regulations, labor and employment regulations, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of tests, as well as by inter-governmental disputes. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business. Our success internationally will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries in which we do business. Failure to manage these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole.\nForeign governments may impose reimbursement standards, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe market our tests in foreign jurisdictions and as such may be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our testing. In some foreign countries, the reimbursement of diagnostic tests is subject to governmental control. In these countries, reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a test candidate. If reimbursement of our future tests is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if reimbursement rates are set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nDomestic and international data protection laws and regulations may restrict our activities and increase our costs.\nDomestic and international data protection laws and regulations may affect our collection, use, storage, and transfer of information obtained within and outside of the United States. State privacy and data security laws in the United States are becoming more stringent. For example, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which was effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. In addition to the CCPA, other states are introducing similar legislation which will impact compliance obligations and increase complexity and cost of compliance.\nThe European Union (\"EU\") has adopted the GDPR, which applies to all EU member states. The GDPR requires us to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about European Union residents. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to $20 million Euros or 4% of our worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nThe GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional procedures to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. The GDPR is a complex law with still evolving regulatory guidance, including with respect to how the GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical studies or other transactions from which we may gain access to personal data. Furthermore, many of the countries within the European Union are still in the process of drafting supplementary data protection legislation in key fields where the GDPR allows for national variation, including the fields of clinical study and other health-related information. These variations in European data protection laws may raise our costs of compliance and result in greater legal risks. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, which may involve civil and criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nEach of our molecular diagnostic tests is processed in a single one of our laboratory facilities, and any loss or prolonged interruption of our ability to use these laboratories or failure to maintain their operation in compliance with applicable regulations would seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on a CLIA-certified facility in Salt Lake City, Utah to perform most of our molecular diagnostic tests; a CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California to perform our Foresight and Prequel tests; a single laboratory facility in Cologne, Germany to perform and produce our EndoPredict test kits; and a CLIA-certified laboratory in Mason, Ohio to perform our GeneSight test. Our laboratory in South San Francisco is near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity and in a region affected by wildfires. These facilities and certain pieces of laboratory equipment would be difficult to replace and may require significant lead time to replace and qualify for use if they became inoperable. We currently have no backup or redundant facility to perform each of our molecular diagnostic tests. In the event any of our clinical testing facilities were to lose its CLIA certification or other required certifications or licenses or were affected by a pandemic or man-made or natural disaster, such as an earthquake, severe weather, flooding, rising sea levels, other physical effects of climate change, power outages or contamination, we would be unable to continue our molecular diagnostic business at current levels to meet customer demands for a significant period of time. Although we maintain insurance on these facilities, including business interruption insurance, it may not be adequate to protect us from all potential losses if these facilities were damaged or destroyed. In addition, any interruption in our molecular diagnostic business would result in a loss of goodwill, including damage to our reputation. If our molecular diagnostic business were interrupted, it would seriously harm our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of third parties for some of our supplies of equipment and reagents. If these supplies become unavailable or are disrupted, including as a result of COVID-19 and responses to it, then we may not be able to successfully perform our research or operate our business on a timely basis or at all.\nWe currently rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our gene sequencing equipment, content enrichment equipment, multiplex protein analysis equipment, robots, and specialty reagents and laboratory supplies required in connection with our testing and research. We believe that currently there are limited alternative suppliers of the equipment, robots, and reagents. The equipment, robots, or reagents may not remain available in commercial quantities at acceptable costs. If we are unable to obtain when needed additional or alternative equipment or robots, or an adequate supply of reagents or other ingredients at commercially reasonable rates, our ability to continue to identify genes and perform molecular diagnostic testing would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could further adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chain. Parts of our direct and indirect supply chain are located overseas and both international and domestic components may continue to be subject to disruption as a result of COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it. We have experienced and may continue to experience a shortage of certain laboratory supplies and equipment, and we may experience a suspension of services from other laboratories or third parties as a result of COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it. Political, administrative, legislative, legal or regulatory actions in response to COVID-19, including the possible use of the Defense Production Act in the United States to compel manufacturers to prioritize other products or customers over us, could create additional supply shortages, disruptions or other uncertainties affecting our research and business. If the supplies and components necessary to manufacture our products become unavailable or are disrupted as a result of COVID-19 and ongoing responses to it, then we may not be able to successfully perform our research or operate our business on a timely basis or at all.\nIf our current research collaborators or scientific advisors terminate their relationships with us or develop relationships with a competitor, our ability to discover genes, proteins, and biomarkers, and to validate and commercialize molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests could be adversely affected.\nWe have relationships with research collaborators at academic and other institutions who conduct research at our request. These research collaborators are not our employees. As a result, we have limited control over their activities and, except as otherwise required by our collaboration agreements, can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities. Our ability to discover genes, proteins, and biomarkers involved in human disease and validate and commercialize molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests will depend in part on the continuation of these collaborations. If any of these collaborations are terminated, we may not be able to enter into other acceptable collaborations. In addition, our existing collaborations may not be successful.\nOur research collaborators and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which could compete with us. Our research collaborators and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for the confidentiality of our proprietary information. We may not, however, be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information related to all collaborations. The dissemination of our confidential information to third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio included issued patents owned or licensed by us and numerous patent applications in the United States and other countries with claims protecting our intellectual property rights. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain additional patents and licenses and protect our existing patent position, both in the United States and in other countries, for compositions, processes, methods and other inventions that we believe are patentable. Our ability to preserve our trade secrets, proprietary data bases and other intellectual property is also important to our long-term success. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. Patents may also issue to third parties which could interfere with our ability to bring our molecular diagnostic tests to market. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nThe patent positions of diagnostic companies, including our patent position, are generally highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, any patents issued to us may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and any future tests are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our patent applications may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technology or tests. In addition, any patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWhere necessary, we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. Any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day-to-day operations. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patent applications;\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022any of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u2022any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable tests, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022we will develop additional proprietary technologies or tests that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business; or\n\u2022our patents or patents that we license from others will survive legal challenges and remain valid and enforceable.\nIf a third party files a patent application with claims to subject matter we have invented, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may declare interference between competing patent applications. If an interference is declared, we may not prevail in the interference. If the other party prevails in the interference, we may be precluded from commercializing services or tests based on the invention or may be required to seek a license. A license may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technologies and databases. Although we require employees, consultants and collaborators to sign confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technologies and databases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technologies or disclose our technologies to our competitors.\nIf we were sued for patent infringement by third parties, we might incur significant costs and delays in test introduction.\nOur tests may also conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to others. Our industry includes many organizations that have or are seeking to discern biomarkers and develop genomic, proteomic and other technologies. To the extent any patents are issued or have been issued to those organizations, the risk increases that the sale of our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests currently being marketed or under development may give rise to claims of patent infringement. Others may have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications covering biomarkers that are similar or identical to our tests. Any of these patent applications may have priority over our patent applications and these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking damages or seeking to enjoin us from testing or marketing our tests. Patent litigation is costly, and even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. If the other parties in any such actions are successful, in addition to any liability for damages, we could be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our tests could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we could experience delays in product introductions or sales growth while we attempt to develop non-infringing alternatives.\nWe believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become involved in this litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets, proprietary databases, and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies and databases, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy if unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurs. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we could lose license rights that are critical to our business.\nWe license intellectual property that is important to our business, including licenses underlying the technology in our molecular diagnostic tests, and in the future, we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. These licenses impose various royalty payments, milestones, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from distributing our current tests, or inhibit our ability to commercialize future test candidates. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or genetic testing, diagnostic, biotechnology or other health care companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims, and if we are unsuccessful, we could be required to pay substantial damages and could lose rights to important intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among other things:\n\u2022CLIA, which requires that laboratories obtain certification from the federal government, and state licensure laws;\n\u2022FDA laws and regulations that apply to medical devices such as our in vitro diagnostics;\n\u2022HIPAA, which imposes comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions; amendments to HIPAA under HITECH, which strengthened and expanded HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increased penalties for violators, extended enforcement authority to state attorneys general and imposed requirements for breach notification;\n\u2022state laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulators;\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program;\n\u2022the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), which is an all-payor anti-kickback prohibition on, among other things, knowingly and willfully paying or offering any remuneration directly or indirectly to induce a referral of an individual to a clinical laboratory;\n\u2022the federal physician self-referral prohibition (Stark Law), which, absent an exception, prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has an applicable financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022Section 216 of the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d), which requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to set Medicare rates for clinical laboratory testing based on private payor data reported by applicable laboratories;\n\u2022the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage;\n\u2022state laws that impose reporting and other compliance-related requirements; and\n\u2022similar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nAs a clinical laboratory, our business practices may face heightened scrutiny from government enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice, the OIG, and CMS. The OIG has issued fraud alerts in recent years, including a fraud alert relating to speaker programs in November 2020, that identify certain arrangements between clinical laboratories and referring physicians as implicating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG has stated that it is particularly concerned about these types of arrangements because the choice of laboratory, as well as the decision to order laboratory tests, typically are made or strongly influenced by the physician, with little or no input from the patient. Moreover, the provision of payments or other items of value by a clinical laboratory to a referral source could be prohibited under the federal self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law or the Physician Self-Referral Law, unless the arrangement meets all criteria of an applicable exception. The government has actively enforced these laws against clinical laboratories in recent years.\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. Our failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in state and federal health care programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratories\u2019 ability to provide or receive payment for our services. We believe that we are in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, but there is a risk that one or more government agencies could take a contrary position, or that a private party could file suit under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act or a similar state law. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations, and other private third-party payors.\nThe growth of our business and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating similar foreign laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of us being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nIf the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate payment for our existing and future tests, if any, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our molecular diagnostic tests or any future diagnostic tests will depend in large part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include state and federal health care programs such as Medicare, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts and limiting both coverage regarding which diagnostic tests they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for existing and new molecular diagnostic tests. We have experienced price reductions from CMS for some of our products, including for our GeneSight\u00ae psychotropic test subsequent to the July 2020 release of the final pharmacogenomics LCD, and we may experience future price reductions from CMS, managed care organizations, and other third-party payors. The fact that a diagnostic test has been approved for reimbursement in the past, for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such a diagnostic test will remain approved for reimbursement, that the reimbursement amount approved for such test will not be reduced in the future, or that similar or additional diagnostic tests will be approved in the future. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any new tests we have launched or may launch will be reimbursed at rates that are comparable to the rates that we historically obtained for our existing product portfolio. As a result, third-party payors may not cover or provide adequate payment for our current or future molecular diagnostic tests to enable us to maintain past levels of revenue or profitability with respect to such tests. Further, third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. In addition, under PAMA, Medicare reimbursement for any given diagnostic test is based on the weighted-median of the payments made by private payors for such test, rendering private payor payment levels even more significant. As a result, future Medicare payments may fluctuate more often and become subject to the willingness of private payors to recognize the value of diagnostic tests generally and any given test individually. On December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which included a provision that delays the next PAMA reporting period for clinical laboratory tests that are not advanced diagnostic tests to January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. In addition, the next round of rate cuts will not be implemented until 2023, with tests receiving cuts of up to 15 percent a year from 2023 through 2025. Any declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of health care. For example, in some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing of many health care products. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose health care requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on product pricing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any tests in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability.\nFDA regulation of our industry generally or our tests specifically could be disruptive to our business.\nAs described further below, the FDA has long claimed authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests but has exercised its \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d to limit enforcement of in vitro diagnostic regulatory requirements on this category of products. The FDA has from time to time appeared to increase its attention to the marketing of pharmacogenetic tests. For example, in late 2018, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding \u201cgenetic tests that claim results can be used to help physicians identify which antidepressant medication would have increased effectiveness or side effects compared to other antidepressant medications.\u201d This safety communication explained that the FDA had reached out to several firms marketing such pharmacogenetic tests where the FDA believed the relationship between genetic variations and a medication\u2019s effects had not been established, including a warning letter to Inova Genomics Laboratory.\nIn early 2019, we provided the FDA with clinical evidence and other information to support our GeneSight Psychotropic test. Later that year, the FDA requested changes to the GeneSight test offering. Although we disagreed that changes to the test were required, we submitted a proposal regarding the reporting of GeneSight test results to healthcare providers that we believed addressed the FDA\u2019s principal concerns and would not affect the benefits that we believe are provided by the GeneSight test.\nSince submitting our proposal to the FDA, we engaged with our trade association in their efforts to defend the offering of pharmacogenomic tests as LDTs and to monitor broader developments across the stakeholder community. In response to public letters from the national laboratory trade association and patient groups, on February 20, 2020, the FDA announced a new \u201ccollaboration between FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research intended to provide the agency\u2019s view of the state of the current science in pharmacogenetics.\u201d Although the announcement again asserted that some of these test offerings may be potentially dangerous, the agency also acknowledged that pharmacogenetic testing \u201coffers promise for informing the selection or dosing of some medications for certain individuals.\u201d In conjunction with the announcement, the FDA also released an updated \u201cTable of Pharmacogenetic Associations,\u201d which lists gene-drug interactions that the agency believes are supported by FDA-approved drug labeling and/or \u201csufficient scientific evidence based on published literature.\u201d The Table has been updated periodically since that time. Based on our discussions with the agency and these recent developments, we have not implemented our earlier proposal. While we see these developments as signaling a positive shift in the FDA\u2019s approach to regulating pharmacogenetic tests, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this matter or its timing, or whether the ultimate form of the GeneSight Psychotropic test offering will have an adverse effect on our revenues from the test.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations related to submission of claims for our services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and corresponding foreign reimbursement programs.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the submission of claims for payment for our services, such as those relating to: coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other state, federal and foreign health care programs; the amounts that we may bill for our services; and the party to which we must submit claims. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or in attempts by state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments already made. Submission of claims in violation of these laws and regulations can result in recoupment of payments already received, substantial civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from state and federal health care programs, and can subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar laws. The failure to report and return an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid program within 60 days of identifying its existence can give rise to liability under the False Claims Act. Further, a government agency could attempt to hold us liable for causing the improper submission of claims by another entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement at issue.\nWe may from time to time be subject to government investigation(s), the unfavorable outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may from time to time be subject to government investigations, which may divert management resources and attention, cause us to incur substantial costs, and/or result in negative publicity, and any unfavorable outcome arising from such investigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crescendo Bioscience, LLC (formerly known as Crescendo Bioscience, Inc.) (\u201cCBI\u201d), received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services requesting that CBI produce documents relating to entities that received payment from CBI for the collection and processing of blood specimens for testing, including a named unrelated company, healthcare providers and other third party entities. On January 30, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California unsealed a qui tam complaint, filed on April 16, 2016 against CBI, alleging violations of the Federal and California False Claims Acts and the California Insurance Fraud Prevention Act. On January 22, 2020, after a multi-year investigation into CBI\u2019s and the Company\u2019s alleged conduct, the United States declined to intervene. On January 27, 2020, the State of California likewise filed its notice of declination. The Company was not aware of the complaint until after it was unsealed. On April 16, 2020, CBI filed a motion to dismiss the action with prejudice. On May 23, 2020, the court denied that motion. We have accrued $48.0 million for a potential settlement of this qui tam lawsuit against CBI and the Company, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. If no settlement is reached, we intend to continue to vigorously defend against this action, but we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate resolution of this matter or determine whether, or to what extent, any loss with respect to this matter may exceed the amount that we have accrued. We may be subject to future claims or investigations under the Federal False Claims Act or a similar state law, and any unfavorable outcome arising from such claims or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be harmed by the loss, suspension, or other restriction on a license, certification, or accreditation, or by the imposition of a fine or penalties, under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or other state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting licensure or certification, or by future changes in these laws or regulations.\nThe diagnostic testing industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations, many of which have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA requires virtually all laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for laboratory testing services. As a condition of CLIA certification, each of our laboratories is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, if the laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of accreditation, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements, including proficiency testing violations, may include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as the imposition of significant fines or criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to regulation under state laws and regulations governing laboratory licensure. Some states have enacted state licensure laws that are more stringent than CLIA. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing our reference laboratory in Germany. Changes in state or foreign licensure laws that affect our ability to offer and provide diagnostic services across state or foreign country lines could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, state and foreign requirements for laboratory certification may be costly or difficult to meet and could affect our ability to receive specimens from certain states or foreign countries.\nAny sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or our failure to renew a CLIA certificate, a state or foreign license, or accreditation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the CLIA certificate of any one of our laboratories is revoked, CMS could seek revocation of the CLIA certificates of our other laboratories based on their common ownership or operation, even though they are separately certified.\nChanges in the way that the FDA regulates tests performed by laboratories like ours could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future.\nHistorically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and has generally not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency\u2019s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA publicly announced its intention to regulate certain LDTs and issued two draft guidance documents that set forth a proposed phased-in risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. However, these guidance documents were not finalized, and the framework was abandoned and replaced by an informal discussion paper reflecting some of the feedback that FDA had received on LDT regulation. The FDA acknowledged that the January 2017 discussion paper does not represent the formal position of the FDA and is not enforceable. Nevertheless, the FDA wanted to share its synthesis of the feedback that it had received in the hope that it might advance public discussion on future LDT oversight. Notwithstanding the discussion paper, the FDA continues to exercise enforcement discretion and may attempt to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time, which could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future.\nIn addition to potential enforcement priority changes from the FDA, in December 2018, bipartisan members of Congress released a discussion draft of a legislation to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs under a shared FDA/CMS framework, and provided opportunities for stakeholders to comment on the proposed legislation. In 2020, the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (\u201cVALID\u201d) Act was formally introduced in both chambers of Congress, and it was reintroduced in revised form for the 117th Congress in July 2021. If enacted, the VALID Act would codify into law the term \u201cin vitro clinical test\u201d (IVCT) to create a new medical product category separate from medical devices that includes products currently regulated as in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) as well as LDTs. The framework would give the FDA the authority to ensure IVCTs are both analytically and clinically valid. CMS would retain the authority to ensure the quality of operations within laboratories. All LDTs on the market prior to enactment of the legislation would be grandfathered and not subject to the new regulation.\nIt is unclear whether the VALID Act will be passed by Congress in its current form or signed into law by the President. Until the FDA finalizes its regulatory position regarding LDTs, or the VALID Act or other legislation is passed reforming the federal government\u2019s regulation of LDTs, it is unknown how the FDA may attempt to regulate our tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval of our tests by the agency. If the VALID Act is implemented as drafted it could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations.\nCompanion and complementary diagnostic tests require FDA approval and we may not be able to secure such approval in a timely manner or at all.\nOur companion and complementary diagnostic products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, companion diagnostics must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products could:\n\u2022take a significant period of time;\n\u2022require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022involve rigorous pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022require changes to products; and\n\u2022result in limitations on the indicated uses of products.\nAlthough we have successfully achieved FDA approval for some tests (e.g., our BRACAnalysis CDx and MyChoice CDx tests), we cannot predict whether or when we will be able to obtain FDA approval for other companion diagnostics that we are developing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is highly volatile, and our stock may lose all or a significant part of its value.\nThe market prices for securities of molecular diagnostic companies have been volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices for these securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly since public trading commenced in October 1995, and it is likely that the market price will continue to fluctuate in the future. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our stock price has ranged from $19.92 per share to $36.66 per share. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Events or factors that may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022major market events, such as the market\u2019s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic generally and its specific impact on the Company;\n\u2022failure of any of our recently launched tests and any new test candidates to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022failure to sustain revenue growth or margins in our molecular diagnostic business;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems and changes in governmental or private insurer reimbursement levels for our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022introduction of new commercial tests or technological innovations by competitors;\n\u2022termination of the licenses underlying our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022delays or other problems with operating our laboratory facilities;\n\u2022failure of any of our research and development programs;\n\u2022changes in intellectual property laws or the enforcement or validity of our patents in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights involving us directly or otherwise affecting the industry as a whole;\n\u2022missing or changing the financial guidance we provide;\n\u2022changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts relating to our common stock or the securities of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the government regulatory approval process for our existing and new tests;\n\u2022failure to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that cover our common stock;\n\u2022public concern over our approved tests and any test candidates;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022government and regulatory investigations;\n\u2022future sales or anticipated sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022the timing and amount of any repurchases of our common stock;\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022seasonal slowness in sales, particularly in the quarters ending September 30th and March 31st, the effects of which may be difficult to understand during periods of growth;\n\u2022general perception of the molecular diagnostic industry and our products;\n\u2022economic, health care and diagnostic trends, disasters or crises and other external factors; and\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, securities class action litigation such as the current stockholder suit pending against the Company discussed elsewhere in this section and certain related matters may affect the market price and demand for our common stock. If any of our other stockholders brought another lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit regardless of the outcome. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe have identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our income tax provision process and our general information technology controls and such weaknesses led to a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. Our inability to remediate these material weaknesses, our discovery of any additional weaknesses, or our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we regularly engage our independent registered public accounting firm to report on its evaluation of those controls. As disclosed in more detail under Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below, during the preparation of our condensed consolidated quarterly financial statements as of September 30, 2021, management concluded that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed related to our income tax provision process. Specifically, we did not provide adequate review and control with respect to the completeness and accuracy of inputs used in the gain/loss calculation related to a divestiture within the interim consolidated income tax provision and related accrual. While we have taken steps to remediate the material weakness, including steps to design and implement enhanced controls over the review of information underlying discrete transactions in the income tax provision, and we plan to continue taking additional steps to remediate the material weakness, this material weakness has not been remediated as of December 31, 2021. Management also concluded that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting exists related to general information technology controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, the material weakness resulted from the aggregation of control deficiencies related to systems supporting our internal control processes. Due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021.\nFailure to have effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and could lead to a restatement of our financial statements. If, as a result of the ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision processes may be adversely affected, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nOur management has taken steps to remediate the material weakness related to our income tax provision process and our management will take steps to remediate the material weaknesses, including continuing to take steps to design and implement enhanced controls over the review of information underlying discrete transactions in the income tax provision, implementing improved IT policies, procedures and control activities for key systems which impact our financial reporting, and increasing resources dedicated to monitoring general information technology controls related to financial reporting to ensure compliance with policies and procedures. We intend to remediate these material weaknesses as soon as possible, but we cannot be certain as to when remediation will be completed. Additional details regarding the remediation efforts are disclosed under Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below. In addition, we may in the future identify additional internal control deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover other errors in financial reporting. During the course of our evaluation of these material weaknesses, we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design additional enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. In addition, there can be no assurance that such remediation efforts will be successful, that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts or that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods. In addition, we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to attest that such internal controls are effective when they are required to do so.\nIf we fail to remediate the material weaknesses and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, you may not be able to rely on the integrity of our financial results, which could result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results, as well as delays or the inability to meet our reporting obligations or to comply with SEC rules and regulations. Any of these could result in delisting actions by the Nasdaq Stock Market, investigation and sanctions by regulatory authorities, stockholder investigations and lawsuits, and could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and re-adoption of our stockholders\u2019 rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nBecause we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, which prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws also contain certain provisions that may make a third-party acquisition of us difficult, including:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, with three classes of directors each serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022a 70% super-majority stockholder vote to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting or act by written consent.\nIn the past, we implemented a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire the Company on a hostile basis. Although the plan expired in July 2011, our Board of Directors could adopt a new plan at any time. The provisions in a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, as well as Section 203, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our Amended Facility restrict our ability to pay dividends. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain sufficient analyst coverage, there can be no assurance that analysts will provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur restated bylaws provide that a state court located within the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur restated bylaws provide that a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 82508, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "MYGN"}
