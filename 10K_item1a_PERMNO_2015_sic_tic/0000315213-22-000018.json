{"cik": "315213", "company": "ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business Environment\nAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company\u2019s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company\u2019s clients. In the recent past, certain of the Company\u2019s markets experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the spread of COVID-19 and the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company\u2019s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company\u2019s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company\u2019s markets could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company\u2019s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company\u2019s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company\u2019s clients, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.\nThe Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign\ncountries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company\u2019s reported income from these operations could decrease. The value of the U.S. dollar has recently weakened against a number of major foreign currencies, but an increase in strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline.\nSignificant U.K. or European developments stemming from the U.K.\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company\u2019s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company\u2019s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations.\nThe currently evolving situation of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has impacted demand for the Company\u2019s services, disrupted the Company\u2019s operations and may continue to do so. The COVID-19 outbreak emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic well-being of the Company\u2019s clients, candidates, employees, and the overall economy. At various times during the outbreak, many counties, states and countries took dramatic action including, without limitation, ordering all nonessential workers to stay home, mandating the closure of schools and nonessential business premises and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population. These measures, while intended to protect human life, had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and may do so in the future if they are continued or reintroduced.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and volatility in the Company\u2019s business. Initially it caused a dramatic increase in unemployment in the United States and in certain other regions in which the Company operates, and mandated business closures and slowing economic activity reduced the use of temporary workers and reduced businesses\u2019 recruitment of new employees resulting in less demand for the Company\u2019s services. During 2021, however, demand for workers and the Company\u2019s services increased significantly as economic activity recovered, worksites reopened, and many business sought to restore or expand workforces that had shrunk during the course of the pandemic. There can be no assurance, however, that this increased demand for workers and the Company\u2019s services will be sustained. Furthermore, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may cause a rapid deterioration of economic conditions and the financial and credit markets, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has transitioned a significant number of the Company\u2019s employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This transition to remote working and the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company\u2019s business and the business and operations of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers who perform critical services for the Company\u2019s business. This transition to remote working has also increased the Company\u2019s vulnerability to risks related to the Company\u2019s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19, including the emerging variants of the disease, and related risks, including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease\u2019s spread. The rapid development and fluidity of the situation, however, precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. The emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that would likely impact demand for the Company\u2019s services. While the Company has navigated the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, its continuation or worsening may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nAny of the above factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase the Company\u2019s costs, severely negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenue, net income, and other results of operations, and impact the Company\u2019s liquidity position. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted, and such impacts may also have the effect of heightening many of the other material risks the Company faces.\nNatural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of the Company's control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the\nCompany's business and financial performance. Historically, the Company\u2019s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's services and the Company's ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change and can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability to offer the Company's services and materially adversely affect the Company's short-term results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to the Company's information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business. The Company\u2019s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment in the United States was at historic lows and during the second half of 2021, as the economy recovered, competition for workers in a number of industries became intense. When unemployment levels are low, finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers\u2019 demands is more challenging. At various times during the pandemic, this challenge has been exacerbated by the withdrawal of some workers from the labor pool, whether due to health concerns, school and daycare closures or other reasons. Any resurgence of COVID-19 may adversely impact the Company's ability to recruit sufficient candidates for certain industries or regions in which the Company operates. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company\u2019s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.\nThe Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company\u2019s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients\u2019 workplaces. The Company\u2019s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. Furthermore, as the employer of record for some individuals who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to COVID-19 is possible, the Company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of the Company\u2019s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company\u2019s clients for which they may hold the Company liable. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. In some cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company\u2019s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.\nThe Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of\nits clients. The Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all the Company's lines of business. In addition, the Company\u2019s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company\u2019s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.\nThe demand for the Company\u2019s services related to regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley, Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 reviews (\"AML\"), and other regulatory compliance services. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (\u201cJOBS\u201d) Act, signed into law in April of 2012, allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly, a number of proposals have been recently or are currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti\u2019s services.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s services from government and public sector clients related to the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease over time. The Company has reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to, among other developments, the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims, as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models. Additional business with public sector clients not directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported in 2021. The pandemic-related services and other work for public sector clients has contributed to the Company's revenue over the past year. It is unknown to what extent business with state, local and other public sector clients may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time. Demand for the Company\u2019s services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the pandemic and their needs evolve. The Company will continue to monitor the situation, but the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the Company\u2019s clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s increased business in the public sector will be sustained.\nLong-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company\u2019s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company\u2019s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the Company's future results.\nProtiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.\nProtiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company\u2019s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.\nProtiviti\u2019s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company\u2019s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company\u2019s compliance with the\nFair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business.\nGovernment imposed vaccine mandates could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In September 2021, President Biden announced two executive orders related to vaccine mandates that would impact the Company's operations in the United States. The first executive order-- the OSHA Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) - was blocked by a stay of enforcement by the United States Supreme Court on January 13, 2022. On January 25, 2022, the Department of Labor withdrew the ETS; however, OSHA could still pursue a vaccine mandate through the regular federal rulemaking process. A second Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors (\u201cEO 14042\u201d) would apply to the Company as a federal contractor and subcontractor. EO 14042 is also subject to legal challenges and is currently subject to a nationwide injunction during the pendency of federal court proceedings. At this time, it is unclear, among other things, if or when any federal vaccine mandates may go into effect. Further, state and local governments in the United States and in international jurisdictions where we operate may implement vaccine mandates (currently New York City has a mandate) and it is not clear if such mandates will go into effect, or stay in effect; whether any will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office; and how compliance will be documented. Should such mandates apply to us, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions. At this time, Protiviti has implemented a vaccine requirement for its operations; however, the Company\u2019s staffing operations do not have a vaccine requirement. Currently, it is not possible to predict the impact that a federal vaccine mandate, any other vaccine mandate, or a vaccine requirement should we elect to adopt one, will have on us or on our workforce. Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, if implemented, may result in employee attrition; however, any failure to implement a vaccine requirement or mandate may also result in employee attrition or resistance to returning to onsite work, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGovernment regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company\u2019s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company\u2019s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.\nThe countries in which we operate may, among other things:\n\u2022create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;\n\u2022require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company\u2019s employees;\n\u2022require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or\n\u2022increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.\nAny future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company\u2019s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign\ncountries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients\u2019 workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company\u2019s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company\u2019s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company\u2019s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the Company fails to comply with Anti-Bribery Laws or economic sanction regulations, it could be subject to substantial fines or other penalties. In many parts of the world, including countries in which the Company operates and/or seeks to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Bribery Laws\u201d). These laws generally prohibit companies, their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. In addition, the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions require the Company to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable Anti-Bribery Laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment from business dealings with certain governments or government agencies or restrictions on the marketing of the Company\u2019s products in certain countries, which could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other relevant agencies of the U.S. government administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, from conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals, subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Similar economic sanctions are imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s international operations subject it to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict the Company\u2019s business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals, and are constantly changing. Penalties for noncompliance with these complex laws and regulations can be significant and include substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, and violations can result in adverse publicity, which could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws, economic sanctions, and other laws and regulations, the Company cannot be sure that its employees, agents or other third parties will not violate such policies or applicable laws and regulations. Any such violations could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of its business, and materially damage the Company\u2019s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of the Company\u2019s senior management.\nHealth care reform could increase the costs of the Company\u2019s temporary staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA\u2019s employer mandate.\nThe U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard an appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA\u2019s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results.\nWhether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years, and the costs of the Company\u2019s health care expenditures may increase.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nThe Company\u2019s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption. The Company\u2019s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company\u2019s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company\u2019s employees and those of the Company\u2019s vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyberattacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company\u2019s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data, and other practices it follows, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information. Such disclosure or damage to the Company\u2019s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings.\nChanges in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the Company\u2019s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company\u2019s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection and security, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and reputation.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Internal Controls and Accounting Policies\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company\u2019s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company\u2019s financial reporting. If the Company\u2019s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.\nFailure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Although the Company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, the Company's efforts may not be sufficient.\nThe collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations. The Company\u2019s processes, corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nU.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company\u2019s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company\u2019s results of operations.", "PERMNO": 52230, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "RHI"}
