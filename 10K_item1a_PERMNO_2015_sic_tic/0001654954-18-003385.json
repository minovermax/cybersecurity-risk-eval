RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be considered with respect to making any investment in our securities as such an investment involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and the other information set forth elsewhere in this report, including the financial statements and related notes, before you decide to purchase shares of our stock. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our stock could decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment. As used herein, the word \u201cbusiness\u201d as used in \u201cmaterial adverse effect on our business\u201d, \u201cadversely affect our business\u201d and other similar phrases includes any of (or any combination of) the Company\u2019s present or future: operations, financial performance, margins, revenues, operating margins, stock value, competitive position, or other indicators of Company performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO HOW WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS:\nWe had a history of losses in prior years and may not maintain profitability.\nPrior to 2017, the Company continuously incurred net losses since we began our current operations in 2004. (see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d). Most recently, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of $415,747, and $1,340,455 in 2016, and 2015, respectively. However, the operating loss in 2016 included a significant nonrecurring expense in the amount of $818,665, primarily a non-cash loss on the issuance of warrants for services valued at $758,665. Without this non-cash expense, operating income was $342,918 for 2016. We plan to continue making significant investments in our sales and clinical programs resulting in a substantial increase in our operating expenses. Consequently, we will need to continue our revenue growth to maintain profitability in the future. We cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to generate future sales growth. If we fail to maintain profitability, our stock price may decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nOur revenue growth for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in forecast revenues may harm our operating results.\nBecause we are a relatively small company, our revenue growth and consequently results of operations are difficult to predict. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as we may not be able to quickly reduce our fixed expenses in response to short-term revenue shortfalls. We have experienced fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue until we achieve a critical mass with our product sales. These fluctuations are due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe uncertainty surrounding our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers;\n\u25cf\nthe length and variability of our sales cycle, which makes it difficult to forecast the quarter in which our sales will occur;\n\u25cf\nissues in manufacturing our products or product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of operating expense relating to the expansion of our business and operations;\n\u25cf\nthe development of new wound care products or product enhancements by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from assumptions and estimates used in preparing our operating plan and how well we execute our strategy and operating plans.\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance, we might not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or any other products we develop or acquire, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe price of our products relative to other products for the same indications;\n\u25cf\nthe perception by physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the efficacy and safety of our products for their indicated applications and treatments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication; and\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts or our partners\u2019 sales and marketing efforts.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products may also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement, if any. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful. If our products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including developing, testing and obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and expanding our sales and marketing efforts for our approved products, which would cause our business to suffer.\nDisruption of, or changes in, our distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products properly, or if the financial condition or operations of our reseller channels weakens, there may be a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, a change in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise, or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales, could adversely affect our business.\nSeveral factors could also result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model or customer base, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:\n\u25cf\nin some instances, we compete with some of our resellers through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not compete; and\n\u25cf\nsome of our resellers may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions.\nIf we cannot meet our future capital requirements, our business will suffer.\nWe have a history of operating losses and with the exception of 2016, negative cash flow from operating activities. As such, we have utilized funds from offerings of our securities to fund our operations. Future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, potential demand for our products, risks from competitors, regulatory approval of our new products, technological change, and dependence on key personnel. Although we have taken steps to improve our overall liquidity, if our cash flow is insufficient, we may be forced either to secure a line of credit or seek additional equity financing in order to:\n\u25cf\nfund operating losses;\n\u25cf\nincrease marketing to address the market for wound care, surgical and ROP products;\n\u25cf\ntake advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion or acquisitions of complementary products or businesses;\n\u25cf\nhire, train and retain employees;\n\u25cf\ndevelop new products; and/or\n\u25cf\nrespond to economic and competitive pressures.\nIf our capital needs are met through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders may be reduced. Our future success may be determined in large part by our ability to obtain additional financing, and the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations which could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available or, if available, that such financing could be obtained upon terms acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, our operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled executive, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract additional qualified employees or retain any such executive officers and other key personnel. The inability to hire qualified personnel; the loss of services of our executive officers or key personnel; or the loss of services of executive officers or key personnel who may be hired in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to manage our planned growth could harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully market and sell our wound care products and implement our business plan requires an effective plan for managing our future growth. We plan to increase the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Future expansion efforts will be expensive and may strain our internal operating resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. If we do not manage growth properly, it could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants.\nCompetition from other medical device companies is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with other companies in acquiring rights to products or technologies from universities and other research institutions. Although our products have performed well in customer evaluations, we are a relatively unknown brand in a market controlled, in large part, by companies with a large customer base. We may not, even with strong customer accounts, be able to establish the credibility necessary to secure large national customers.\nA number of factors may limit the market acceptance of our products, including the timing of regulatory approvals and market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative products, and the price of our products relative to alternative products, the availability of third party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by third party distributors or agents that we retain. There can be no assurance that our products will receive market acceptance in a commercially viable period of time, if at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can develop products that are more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing or acquiring products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us, that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nOur competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nlarge and established distribution networks in the U.S. and/or in international markets;\n\u25cf\ngreater financial, managerial and other resources for products research and development, sales and marketing efforts and protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ngreater name recognition;\n\u25cf\nlarger consumer base;\n\u25cf\nmore expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and/or clearances from the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nThe presence of competition in our market may lead to pricing pressure which would make it more difficult to sell our products at a price that will make us profitable or may prevent us from selling our products at all. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use networks to collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Further, they may cause disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage to our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient product liability insurance to cover claims against us.\nProduct liability insurance for the healthcare industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage as commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance policy or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be sufficient to offset existing or future claims. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insurance coverage and not subject to any indemnification or contribution could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS:\nCompetitors could invent products superior to ours and cause our products and technologies to become obsolete.\nThe wound care sector of the medical products industry is characterized by a multitude of technologies and intense competition. Our competitors currently manufacture and distribute a variety of products that are, in many respects, comparable to our products. Many suppliers of competing products are considerably larger and have much greater resources than we do. In addition, many specialized products companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of wound care products which may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and may commercialize wound care products on their own or through joint ventures. It is possible that these competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than any we currently have. If this occurs, any of our products and technology affected by these developments could become obsolete.\nWe may have exposure to product liability claims.\nAlthough we have contractual indemnity from the manufacturer of CellerateRX for liability claims related to their products, we could face a product liability claim outside of the scope of the contractual indemnity. We do not have, and do not anticipate obtaining, contractual indemnification from parties supplying raw materials or parties marketing the products we sell. In any event, indemnification from the manufacturer of CellerateRX or from any other party is limited by the terms of the indemnity and by the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could result in judgments, fines, damages and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur significant expense investigating and defending these claims, even if they do not result in liability. Moreover, even if no judgments, fines, damages or liabilities are imposed on us, our reputation could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:\nThe patent on the CellerateRX products expired in February 2018.\nCellerateRX products no longer benefit from the protection of a patent that expired in February 2018 and may become subject to increased competition resulting from the marketing of substantially equivalent products, and the Company\u2019s performance may suffer as a result.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nPart of our success depends on our ability to protect proprietary rights to technologies used in certain of our products. We rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. Our patents and patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products into the market. Our patents, if challenged or our attempts to enforce them, may not necessarily be upheld by the courts. Efforts to enforce any of our proprietary rights could be time-consuming and expensive, which could adversely affect our business and prospects and divert management\u2019s attention. There can be no assurance that our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us.\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nThird parties, including customers, may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions may emerge over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertions, particularly in the U.S. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the healthcare field, the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe the patent rights of others. The asserted claims or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATIONS:\nOur business is affected by numerous regulations.\nGovernment regulation by the U.S. FDA and similar agencies in other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products and in the acquisition or licensing of new products. Complying with government regulations is often time consuming and expensive and may involve delays or actions adversely impacting the marketing and sale of our current or future products.\nFollowing initial regulatory approval of any products that we may develop, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including review of adverse (drug or device) experiences or reactions and clinical results that are reported after our products become commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or continued actions required as a condition of approval. The manufacturing facilities we use (and may use) to make any of our products may become subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. If a previously unknown problem with a product or a manufacturing and laboratory facility used by us is discovered, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often requires FDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. In addition, for products we develop in the future, we and our contract manufacturers may be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be fined, be forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, which would materially harm our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion.\nFurther, various healthcare reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state levels. We cannot predict whether foreign, federal, state or local healthcare reform legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business. The implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes which would likely adversely affect our business. In addition, the enacted excise tax may materially and adversely affect our business.\nDistribution of our products outside the U.S. is subject to extensive government regulation. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market; the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations, vary from country to country. We do not know whether we will obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals.\nIf we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market future medical device products, we will be unable to commercialize these products until such clearance or approval is obtained.\nThe developing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of medical devices is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance and approval of certain medical technology products is costly and time consuming. Inherent in the development of new medical products is the potential for delay because product testing, including clinical evaluation, is required before many products can be approved for human use. With respect to medical devices, such as those that we manufacture and market, before a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product can be marketed (unless it is a Class I device), it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that the proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA approval pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The premarket approval process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Both the 510(k) and premarket approval processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances, seizure or recall of products, injunctions against the manufacture, holding, distribution, marketing and sale of a product and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals. Meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of our new products for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete against us.\nWe cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any products developed by us on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that approval will not entail limiting the indicated uses for which we may market the product, which could limit the potential market for any of these products.\nChanges to the FDA approval process or ongoing regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain FDA approval of new products or comply with ongoing requirements.\nNew government regulations may be enacted and changes in FDA policies and regulations and, their interpretation and enforcement, could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of new products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Therefore, we do not know whether we will be able to continue to comply with such regulations or whether the costs of such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes could, among other things, require different labeling, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, or limitations on product distribution. These changes, or others required by the FDA could have an adverse effect on our business, and specifically, on the sales of these products. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we will not be permitted to market our products and our business would suffer.\nModifications to our current products may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to a FDA-cleared product that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, requires a new FDA 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a premarket approval (PMA). The FDA requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, but the FDA may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer. In the future, we may make additional modifications to our products after they have received FDA clearance or approval and, in appropriate circumstances, determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our decisions not to seek new clearance or approval and may require us to obtain clearance or approval for previous modifications to our products. If that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the necessary clearance or approval. Under these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nChanges in reimbursement policies and regulations by governmental or other third-party payers may have an adverse impact on the use of our products.\nA significant portion of our wound care products are purchased principally for the Medicare and Medicaid eligible population by hospital outpatient clinics, wound care clinics, durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which typically bill various third-party payers, primarily state and federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), and managed care plans, for the products and services provided to their patients. Although our wound care products are currently eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B, adjustments to our reimbursement amounts or a change in Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS). reimbursement policies could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities in this area. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical to the success of our business because reimbursement status affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. In addition, our ability to obtain reimbursement approval in foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to expand our product offerings internationally.\nThird-party payers have adopted, and are continuing to adopt, a number of policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These policies include the imposition of conditions of payment by foreign, state and federal healthcare programs as well as private insurance plans, and the reduction in reimbursement amounts applicable to specific products and services.\nChanges in healthcare systems in the U.S. or internationally in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our products or denies coverage for these procedures would also have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices which our customers are willing to pay for them.\nWe and our sales personnel, whether employed by us or by others, must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to liability, or claims of alleged violations. Possible sanctions for violation of these fraud and abuse laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, Public Health Service (PHS), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions could occur. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws that also authorize substantial civil and criminal penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws may result in an adverse effect on our business.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of an individual or the ordering or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by any federal healthcare program, including Medicare.\nThe scope and enforcement of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws is uncertain and is subject to rapid change. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement agencies will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any state or federal investigation, regardless of the outcome, could be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nIf we engage additional physicians on a consulting basis, the agreements with these physicians will be structured to comply with all applicable laws, including the federal ban on physician self-referrals (commonly known as the \u201cStark Law\u201d) the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, state anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws. Even so, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may view these agreements as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties. Because our strategy includes the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with our physician advisors who refer or order our products to be in violation of one or more health care fraud and abuse laws. Such government action could harm our reputation and the reputations of our physician advisors. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial because we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from state and federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for non-compliance.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS OR OUR COMMON STOCK:\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations or new products and services by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf\nindustry developments;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u25cf\neconomic, political and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries, both generally or specific to us and our products; and\n\u25cf\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nAlthough publicly traded securities are subject to price and volume fluctuations, it is likely that our common stock will experience these fluctuations to a greater degree than the securities of more established and better capitalized organizations.\nOur common stock does not have a vigorous trading market and you may not be able to sell your securities when desired.\nAlthough there is a public market for our common stock, trading volume has been historically low, which could impact the stock price and the ability to sell shares of our common stock. We can give no assurance that a more active and liquid public market for the shares of our common stock will develop in the future.\nThe potential sale of large amounts of common stock may have a negative effect upon the market value of our shares.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, future sales of large amounts of common stock could adversely affect or inhibit our ability to raise capital. Substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable, without restriction or registration under the Securities Act (other than the sales volume restrictions of Rule 144 applicable to shares held beneficially by persons who may be deemed to be affiliates). The price of our common stock could also drop as a result of the exercise of options for common stock or the perception that such sales or exercise of options could occur.\nWe have not paid, and we are unlikely to pay in the near future, cash dividends on our securities.\nWe have not paid and do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock, which may limit the current return available on an investment in our stock. Future dividends on our stock, if any, will depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and such other factors as our management personnel may consider relevant. Currently, we intend to retain earnings, if any, to increase our net worth and reserves.\n\u201cPenny Stock\u201d Limitations.\nRule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d For purposes relevant to the Company, a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are likely not available to us. It is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks for the immediate foreseeable future. This classification severely and adversely affects any market liquidity of our common stock.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks and that the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and the broker or dealer must make a special written determination that the transaction in penny stocks is suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of a transaction in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market that, in highlight form, sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. These restrictions and regulations limit the appeal of penny stock to some investors and may limit the liquidity of shares of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about (a) the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading; (b) commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative; (c) current quotations for the securities; and (d) the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, the broker or dealer must send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nBecause of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced paperwork and disclosures. In addition, they may encounter difficulties when attempting to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market. These additional sales practices and disclosure requirements may impede the sale of our securities and the liquidity of our securities may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price. Our shares, in all probability, will be considered subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future, and our shareholders may, as a result, find it difficult to sell their shares.\nA few of our existing shareholders own a large percentage of our voting stock and have a significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval and may delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur directors own or control a large percentage of our common stock (See \u201cItem 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d). As a result, our directors could have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets as well as other corporate transactions. This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of our directors, and principal stockholders; e.g., our principal stockholders could delay or prevent an acquisition or merger even if the transaction would benefit other stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as amended, may delay or prevent a potential takeover of the Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a potential takeover of the Company, even if the takeover is in the best interest of our shareholders. For example, the Bylaws limit when shareholders may call a special meeting of shareholders, and these and other provisions may negatively affect the price of our stock. The Articles also allow our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to fill vacancies, including newly created directorships.\nOur Board can authorize the issuance of preferred stock, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock and make a change of control of the Company more difficult even if it might benefit our shareholders.\nThe Board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Accordingly, we may issue shares of preferred stock with a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution, or that may otherwise adversely affect the voting or other rights of the holders of common stock. Issuances of preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations of the preferred stock, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, even if that change of control might benefit our shareholders.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nWhen used in this Form 10-K or other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the Company\u2019s press releases or other public or shareholder communications, or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized officer of the Company\u2019s executive officers, the words or phrases \u201cwould be\u201d, \u201cwill allow\u201d, \u201cintends to\u201d, \u201cwill likely result\u201d, \u201care expected to\u201d, \u201cwill continue\u201d, \u201cis anticipated\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, or similar expressions are intended to identify \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThe Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and advises readers that forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties.
