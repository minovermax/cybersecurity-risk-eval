{"cik": "1709164", "company": "Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nHamilton Beach Brands, Inc.\nHBB\u2019s business is sensitive to the strength of the North American consumer markets and weakness in these markets could\nadversely affect its business.\nThe strength of the economy in the United States, and to a lesser degree in Canada and Mexico, has a significant impact on HBB\u2019s performance. Weakness in consumer confidence and poor financial performance by mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, warehouse clubs, department stores or any of HBB\u2019s other customers could result in reduced revenues and profitability. A general slowdown in the consumer sector could result in additional pricing and marketing support pressures on HBB.\nThe market for HBB\u2019s products is highly seasonal and dependent on consumer spending, which could result in significant variations in our revenues and profitability.\nSales of HBB\u2019s products are related to consumer spending. A downturn in the general economy or a shift in consumer spending away from small electric household and specialty housewares appliances could adversely affect its business. In addition, the market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. HBB generally recognizes a substantial portion of its sales in the last half of the year as sales of small electric appliances and specialty housewares appliances increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Accordingly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of past operating results of HBB are meaningful only when comparing equivalent time periods, if at all. Any economic downturn, decrease in consumer spending or shift in consumer spending away from small electric household and specialty housewares appliances may significantly reduce revenues and profitability.\nHBB is dependent on key customers and the loss of, or significant decline in business from, one or more of its key customers could materially reduce its revenues and profitability and its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB relies on several key customers. Although HBB has long-established relationships with many customers, it does not have any long-term supply contracts with these customers, and purchases are generally made using individual purchase orders. A loss of or significant reduction in sales to any key customer could result in significant decreases in HBB\u2019s revenues and profitability and an inability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB must receive a continuous flow of new orders from its large, high-volume retail customers; however, it may be unable to continually meet the needs of those customers. In addition, failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders or significant pressure to reduce prices from key customers could impair its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nAs a result of dependence on its key customers, HBB could experience a material adverse effect on its revenues and profitability if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022\nthe insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer;\n\u2022\na declining market in which customers materially reduce orders or demand lower prices; or\n\u2022\na strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers.\nIf HBB were to lose, or experience a significant decline in business from, any major customer or if any major customers were to go bankrupt, HBB might be unable to find alternate distribution outlets.\nHBB depends on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of all of its products, which subjects it to risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain.\nHBB is dependent on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of all of its products. HBB\u2019s ability to select reliable suppliers that provide timely deliveries of quality products will impact its success in meeting customer demand. Any inability of HBB\u2019s suppliers to timely deliver products that meet HBB\u2019s specifications or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to HBB. Any significant failure by HBB to obtain quality products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Because HBB\u2019s suppliers are primarily based in China, international operations subject HBB to additional risks including, among others:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\npotential political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and quotas;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and international customs and tariffs, including embargoes and customs restrictions;\n\u2022\nuncertainties involving the costs to transport products;\n\u2022\nlong distance shipping routes dependent upon a small group of shipping and rail carriers and import facilities;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nregulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;\n\u2022\nprotection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and administrative support; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including significant changes in tax law.\nThe foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on HBB\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the supply of products, which may result in material increases in expenses and decreases in revenues and profitability.\nHBB is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nHBB\u2019s products are supplied by third-party suppliers located primarily in China. HBB generally negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies could result in certain non-U.S. manufacturers increasing the U.S. dollar prices for future product purchases.\nIn addition, a portion of HBB\u2019s revenue is derived from international operations, and HBB anticipates that a portion of sales will continue to come from outside the U.S. in the future. HBB\u2019s international revenues may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any hedging activities HBB engages in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HBB cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which HBB can mitigate these risks.\nIncreases in costs of products may materially reduce our profitability.\nFactors that are largely beyond our control, such as movements in commodity prices for the raw materials needed by suppliers of HBB\u2019s products, may affect the cost of products, and HBB may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. As an example, HBB\u2019s products require a substantial amount of plastic. Because the primary resource used in plastic is petroleum, the cost and availability of plastic varies to a great extent with the price of petroleum. When the prices of petroleum, as well as steel, aluminum and copper, increase significantly, they may materially reduce our profitability.\nThe increasing concentration of HBB\u2019s branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among a few retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenues and profitability.\nWith the growing trend towards the concentration of HBB\u2019s branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among a few retailers, HBB is increasingly dependent upon fewer customers whose bargaining strength is growing as a result of this concentration. HBB sells a substantial quantity of products to mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers and other retail outlets. These retailers generally have a large selection of small electric household and specialty housewares appliance suppliers to choose from. As a result, HBB competes for retail shelf space with its competitors. In addition, certain of HBB\u2019s larger customers use their own private label brands on household appliances that compete directly with some of HBB\u2019s products. As the retailers in the small electric household appliance industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.\nThe small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry is consolidating, which could reduce HBB\u2019s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit our ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.\nOver the past several years, the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry has undergone consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry primarily consists of a limited number of large distributors. HBB\u2019s ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry or maintain or enhance HBB\u2019s relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors, including as a result of increased consolidation in the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry.\nIf HBB is unable to continue to enhance existing products, as well as develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products,\nwhich could materially reduce revenues and profitability, which have historically benefited from sales of new products.\nOne of HBB\u2019s strategic initiatives is to enhance placements through consumer-driven innovative products to generate revenue growth. HBB may not be able to compete as effectively with competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of customers, unless HBB can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which HBB competes. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological and product process levels and HBB may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Competitors\u2019 new products may beat HBB\u2019s products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features, obtain better market acceptance, or render HBB\u2019s products obsolete. Any new products that HBB develops may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful revenues or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and development.\nHBB\u2019s inability to compete effectively with competitors in its industry, including large established companies with greater resources, could result in lost market share and decreased revenues.\nThe small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many small manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Additional competitors may also enter this market and cause competition to intensify. For example, some of HBB\u2019s customers have expressed interest in sourcing, or expanding the extent of sourcing, small electric household and commercial appliances directly from manufacturers in Asia. We believe competition is based upon several factors, including product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, merchandising, promotion and warranty. If HBB fails to compete effectively with these manufacturers and distributors, it could lose market share and experience a decrease in revenues, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nHBB also competes with established companies, a number of which have substantially greater facilities, personnel, financial and other resources. In addition, HBB competes with its own retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and importers and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products. Some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete. As a result of this competition, HBB could lose market share and revenues.\nHBB may become subject to claims under foreign laws and regulations, which may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting.\nBecause HBB has employees, property and business operations outside of the United States, HBB is subject to the laws and the court systems of many jurisdictions. HBB may become subject to claims outside the United States for violations or alleged violations of laws with respect to the current or future foreign operations of HBB. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. International litigation is often expensive, time-consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce HBB\u2019s profitability and its ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nHBB\u2019s actual liabilities relating to environmental matters may exceed our expectations.\nHBB is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the\nmanagement and disposal of hazardous substances. If HBB fails to comply with these laws, then we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, future changes to environmental laws could require HBB to incur significant additional expense.\nHBB is investigating or remediating historical contamination at some current and former sites related to HBB\u2019s prior manufacturing operations or the operations of businesses HBB acquired. In addition, the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant cleanup costs that could have a material adverse effect on HBB\u2019s financial conditions and results of operations.\nHBB could, under some circumstances, also be held financially liable for or suffer other adverse effects due to environmental violations or contamination caused by prior owners of businesses HBB has acquired. In certain circumstances, HBB\u2019s financial liability for cleanup costs takes into account agreements with an unrelated third party. HBB\u2019s liability for these costs could increase if the unrelated third party does not, or cannot, perform its obligations under those agreements. In addition, under some of the agreements through which HBB has sold real estate, HBB has retained responsibility for certain contingent environmental liabilities arising from pre-closing operations. These liabilities may not arise, if at all, until years after HBB sold these operations and could require us to incur significant additional expenses, which could materially adversely affect HBB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that HBB relies on newly acquired businesses or new product lines to expand its business, these acquisitions or new product lines may not contribute positively to HBB\u2019s earnings because anticipated sales volumes and synergies may not materialize, cost savings may be less than expected or acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities.\nHBB may acquire partial or full ownership in businesses or may acquire rights to market and distribute particular products or lines of products. The acquisition of a business or of the rights to market specific products or use specific product names may involve a financial commitment by HBB, either in the form of cash or stock consideration. HBB may not be able to acquire businesses and develop products that will contribute positively to HBB\u2019s earnings. Anticipated synergies may not materialize, cost savings may be less than expected, sales of products may not meet expectations or acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities.\nHBB\u2019s business involves the potential for product recalls, which could affect HBB\u2019s sales and profitability.\nAs a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the CPSC to seek to exclude from the market those products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or HBB may voluntarily do so. Any repurchases or recalls of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation or the value of our brands. If HBB is required to remove, or HBB voluntarily removes our products from the market, our reputation or brands could be tarnished, and HBB might have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold. Furthermore, failure to timely notify the CPSC of a potential safety hazard can result in fines being assessed against HBB. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which HBB sells our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. HBB\u2019s results of operations are also susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality and safety of our products. In particular, product recalls may result in a decline in sales for a particular product.\nHBB\u2019s business subjects it to product liability claims, which could affect the reputation, sales and profitability of HBB and, potentially, KC.\nHBB faces exposure to product liability claims if one of our products is alleged to have caused property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. HBB bears all costs associated with product liability claims up to a defined self-insured loss limit per claim and maintains product liability insurance for claims above this self-insured level. If a product liability claim is brought against HBB, our sales and profitability could be affected adversely as a result of negative publicity related to the claim, costs associated with any replacement of the product or expenses related to defending these claims. This could be true even if the claims themselves are ultimately settled for immaterial amounts. In addition, HBB may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on terms acceptable to HBB in the future. If the number of product liability claims HBB experiences exceeds historical amounts, if HBB is unable to maintain product liability insurance or if HBB\u2019s product liability claims exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, HBB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely. The sales and profitability of KC, as an affiliate of HBB and a seller of certain HBB products, could also be affected adversely in the event of negative HBB publicity.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on HBB.\nThe SEC adopted conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act on August 22, 2012. The rules require disclosure of the use of certain minerals, commonly known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are mined from the DRC and adjoining countries. HBB may incur additional costs and expenses to comply with these rules, including (i) due diligence to verify the sources of such conflict minerals; and (ii) any changes that HBB may make to its products, processes, or sources of supply as a result of such diligence and verification activities. Since HBB\u2019s supply chain is complex, ultimately it may not be able to designate all products as \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d which may adversely affect its reputation with certain customers. In such event, HBB may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require products purchased from HBB to be \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d. If HBB is not able to meet such requirements, customers may choose not to purchase HBB products, which could adversely affect sales and the value of portions of HBB\u2019s inventory. Further, there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products containing only DRC conflict free parts, components and subassemblies and, as a result, HBB cannot be sure that it will be able to satisfy its purchase requirements from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Any one or a combination of these various factors could harm HBB\u2019s business, and materially and adversely affect HBB\u2019s results of operations.\nHBB is subject in the ordinary course of its business, in the United States and elsewhere, to many statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations that, if violated by HBB or its affiliates, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on HBB\u2019s business. HBB is required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws adopted in many of the countries in which HBB does business which prohibit HBB from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and also require maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions. Under the FCPA, companies operating in the United States may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. If HBB does not properly implement and maintain practices and controls with respect to compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws, or if HBB fails to enforce those practices and controls properly, HBB may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on HBB\u2019s business and capital raising activities, any of which could materially and adversely affect HBB\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHBB may be subject to risks relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans, which may affect its financial position.\nBecause HBB\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are frozen and no longer provide for the accrual of future benefits, the expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to its defined benefit pension plans are dependent on, changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which, in turn, are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require HBB to increase the cash contributed to its defined benefit pension plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe Kitchen Collection, LLC\nAs consumer shopping habits change, foot traffic to brick and mortar stores could continue to decline and result in a loss of\nmarket share, revenues and profitability, and store closures at a more rapid pace than in the past.\nThe continuing and accelerating shift in consumer shopping patterns from traditional brick and mortar stores to e-commerce has resulted in declining mall traffic which has impacted most retailers. Our stores are located in outlet and traditional malls and our success depends in part on the overall ability of these malls to successfully generate and maintain customer foot traffic. We cannot control the success of individual malls, or store closures by other retailers, which may lead to mall vacancies and reduced customer foot traffic. Reduced customer foot traffic could result in reduced revenues and profitability.\nThe market for KC\u2019s products is highly seasonal and dependent on consumer spending, which could result in significant variations in our revenues and profitability.\nSales of products sold at KC stores are subject to a number of factors related to consumer spending, including general economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment rates, business conditions, interest rates, levels of consumer confidence, energy prices, mortgage rates, the level of consumer debt and taxation. In addition, KC generally recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues and operating profit in the last half of the year as sales to consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Accordingly, any economic downturn, decrease in consumer spending or a shift in consumer spending away from KC\u2019s products could significantly reduce, or cause significant variations in, KC\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nKC faces an extremely competitive specialty retail market, and such competition could result in a reduction of KC\u2019s prices and loss of market share.\nThe retail market is highly competitive. KC competes against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores and internet and catalog retailers. Widespread sourcing of Chinese products allows many retailers to offer value-priced kitchen products. Many of KC\u2019s competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources. This competition could result in the reduction of KC product prices and a loss of market share, revenues and profitability.\nKC may not be able to forecast customer preferences accurately in its merchandise selections.\nKC\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to anticipate the tastes of its customers and to provide merchandise that appeals to their preferences. KC\u2019s strategy requires merchandising staff to introduce products that meet current customer preferences and that are affordable and distinctive in quality and design. KC\u2019s failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer trends could cause excess inventories and higher mark-downs or a shortage of products and could harm KC\u2019s business and operating results.\nKC depends on third-party suppliers for most of its products, which subjects KC to risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain.\nKC is dependent on third-party suppliers for all of its products. KC\u2019s inability to select reliable suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products could reduce its success in meeting customer demand. Any inability of KC\u2019s suppliers to timely deliver products or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to KC. The loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect KC\u2019s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured. In addition, KC may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms in the future. KC\u2019s business could also be adversely affected by delays in product shipments due to freight difficulties, strikes or other difficulties at its principal transport providers. Any significant failure by KC to obtain products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply could have a material adverse effect on KC\u2019s profitability.\nKC may be forced to close a significant number of stores, which could adversely impact its profitability.\nAlthough we have slowed the opening of new KC retail stores and have continued to close underperforming stores, the continuing and accelerating shift in consumer shopping patterns from traditional brick and mortar stores to e-commerce has resulted in declining outlet and traditional mall traffic, which has impacted most retailers. In the past, we have closed stores that did not generate acceptable profitability, and we may close additional stores in the future at a more rapid pace than in the past.\nIn addition, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future. Should significant consolidation continue, a large proportion of KC\u2019s stores could be concentrated with one or a few entities that could then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to KC due to their significant negotiating leverage. If KC is unable to negotiate favorable lease terms with these entities or if KC decides to close stores in the future and is unable to negotiate favorable terms with the landlords regarding the remaining lease obligations, KC could be liable for significant lease termination costs, which could have a material adverse effect on KC\u2019s financial results.\nHamilton Beach Holding\nHamilton Beach Holding has no history operating as an independent public company prior to the spin-off on which you can evaluate Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s business strategy.\nHamilton Beach Holding has no operating history as an independent public company prior to the spin-off. Accordingly, Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s public company business strategy may not be successful on a stand-alone basis.\nHamilton Beach Holding is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce its profitability.\nHamilton Beach Holding is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of its and its subsidiaries\u2019 key personnel and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s business. Therefore, Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain current and additional skilled and experienced management personnel. Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its business effectively and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nHamilton Beach Holding accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which it is now subject as an independent company. If Hamilton Beach Holding is not able to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of the spin-off, Hamilton Beach Holding is now directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on Hamilton Beach Holding management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources. To comply with these requirements, Hamilton Beach Holding may need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. Hamilton Beach Holding may incur additional annual expenses related to these steps. If Hamilton Beach Holding is unable to upgrade the financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, its ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHamilton Beach Holding\u2019s financing arrangements will subject Hamilton Beach Holding to various restrictions that could limit operating flexibility.\nHBB\u2019s and KC\u2019s respective credit facilities contain covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, require HBB and KC to satisfy certain financial tests, maintain certain financial ratios and restrict HBB\u2019s and KC\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness. The restrictions and covenants in HBB\u2019s and KC\u2019s respective credit facilities, and other future financing arrangements may limit HBB\u2019s and KC\u2019s ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings HBB and KC may incur.\nHamilton Beach Holding\u2019s business could suffer if HBB\u2019s or KC\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted, cease to operate effectively or become subject to a security breach.\nHamilton Beach Holding and its subsidiaries rely heavily on information technology systems to operate websites; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory; purchase, sell and ship merchandise on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of computer hardware and software systems and maintain cyber security. Despite our cyber security efforts, our information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power outages, third-party intrusions and other technical malfunctions. If our systems are damaged, or fail to function properly, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems and could endure delays in operations.\nIn addition, we regularly evaluate information technology systems and requirements and from time to time implement modifications and/or upgrades to our information technology systems. Modifications include replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems and acquiring new systems with new functionality. There are inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. We believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks but there can be no assurance that our actions will be successful or sufficient.\nAny material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by a security breach or our failure to successfully upgrade its systems, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed. Such a loss or delay could reduce demand and cause our sales and/or profitability to decline.\nThrough sales and marketing activities and business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from its customers, vendors and employees. For example, KC handles, collects and stores personal information in connection with customers\u2019 purchasing products or services, or otherwise communicating or interacting with KC. KC also accepts payments using a variety of methods, including debit and credit cards, gift cards, electronic transfer of funds and others. Although KC has taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Unauthorized parties may attempt to penetrate our and our vendors\u2019 network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. Additionally, methods to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information change frequently and may be difficult to detect, which can impact our ability to respond appropriately. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information or for failing to respond appropriately. Loss, unauthorized access to, or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe transition services agreement Hamilton Beach Holding entered into with NACCO contains early termination provisions that, if exercised by NACCO, could prevent Hamilton Beach Holding from operating Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s business in a cost-efficient manner and could disrupt Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s operations.\nHamilton Beach Holding entered into a transition services agreement with NACCO on September 29, 2017. Under the terms of the transition services agreement, the Company obtains certain services from NACCO on a transition basis for varying periods after the spin-off date, none of which is expected to exceed one year, with the option to extend the transition periods for one or more services. The transition services agreement is subject to early termination provisions. For instance, either Hamilton Beach Holding or NACCO may terminate the agreement if:\n\u2022\nthe other party has violated any material provision of the agreement and such violation has not been remedied within 30 days after written notice thereof; or\n\u2022\nthe other party has filed, or has had filed against it, a petition seeking relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditor\u2019s rights.\nIn addition, both NACCO and Hamilton Beach Holding may terminate any transition service that is being provided at any time by giving such party 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to do so. NACCO and Hamilton Beach Holding may also terminate the agreement by mutual written agreement. Early termination of this agreement by NACCO could increase Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s transition-related costs and could disrupt our new public company operations.\nHamilton Beach Holding may experience increased costs or decreased operational efficiencies as a result of its needing to replace corporate functions previously provided by NACCO.\nNACCO has historically assisted with certain Hamilton Beach Holding operations, including accounting, finance, tax administration, internal audit and strategic development. Pursuant to the transition services agreement, NACCO will provide support to Hamilton Beach Holding with respect to some of these functions, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral accounting support;\n\u2022\nsupport in responding to requests from regulatory and compliance agencies;\n\u2022\ntax compliance and consulting support;\n\u2022\ninternal audit services and internal audit consulting and advisory services;\n\u2022\ngeneral legal support;\n\u2022\nemployee benefit and human resources legal and consulting support;\n\u2022\ncompensation support; and\n\u2022\ninvestor relations support,\nfor varying periods after the spin-off date, none of which is expected to exceed one year, with the option to extend the transition periods for one or more services. Hamilton Beach Holding will need to replicate certain personnel and services to which Hamilton Beach Holding will no longer have access after our spin-off from NACCO. Hamilton Beach Holding may incur additional costs to implement and support these functions.\nIn addition, there may be an adverse operational impact on Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s businesses as a result of the significant Hamilton Beach Holding management and employee time that will be dedicated to building these capabilities during the first few years after the spin-off. If Hamilton Beach Holding begins to operate these functions independently, without implementing adequate business functions of our own, Hamilton Beach Holding may not be able to operate effectively and its profitability may decline.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under the Code, it may result in corporate-level taxable gain to NACCO under the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or NACCO\u2019s stock occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or NACCO\u2019s stock within two years before or two years after the spin-off are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or NACCO may be able to rebut that presumption. It is unclear whether any increase in voting power by holders of our Class B Common Stock by reason of the conversion by other holders of Hamilton Beach Holding Class B Common Stock to Hamilton Beach Holding Class A Common Stock should be considered an acquisition of voting power as part of a plan or series of related transactions. However, even if so treated, any such voting shift would not alone cause an acquisition of 50% or more of the voting power of our Common Stock and, as a result, would not, by itself, cause the spin-off to be taxable to NACCO under Section 355(e) of the Code.\nUnder the Tax Allocation Agreement entered into with NACCO, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the spin-off from being tax-free. Further, during the two-year period following the spin-off, without obtaining the consent of NACCO, a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm, we may be prohibited from:\n\u2022\napproving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of 35% or more of the value or 5% or more of the voting power of our common stock;\n\u2022\nredeeming equity securities;\n\u2022\nselling or otherwise disposing of more than 35% of the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nacquiring a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire 35% or more of the value or 5% or more of the voting power of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nengaging in certain internal transactions.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that could maximize the value of our business.\nThe amount and frequency of dividend payments made on Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s common stock could change.\nHamilton Beach Holding\u2019s board of directors (the \"Board\") has the power to determine the amount and frequency of the payment of dividends. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are based on earnings, capital, and future expense requirements, financial conditions, contractual limitations and other factors our Board may consider.\nCertain members of the extended founding family of NACCO own a substantial amount of Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s Class A and Class B common stock, and if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant actions.\nHamilton Beach Holding has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock (\"Class A Common\") and Class B common stock (\"Class B Common\"). Holders of Class A Common will be entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2017, accounted for approximately 15.57% of the voting power of Hamilton Beach Holding. Holders of Class B Common are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2017, accounted for the remaining voting power of Hamilton Beach Holding. As of December 31, 2017, certain members of NACCO\u2019s extended founding family held approximately 37.96% of Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s Class A Common and 69.99% of Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s Class B Common. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of NACCO\u2019s extended founding family could exercise 65.01% of Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s total voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they would exert significant control over the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant actions, such as certain amendments to Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and sales of Hamilton Beach Holding or substantially all of its assets. Because such family members could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, Hamilton Beach Holding may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions, as amended and restated in connection with us becoming a public company, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquiror from making a tender offer for our shares or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. These provisions, among other things, establish that our Board fixes the number of members of the Board, and establish advance notice requirements for nomination of candidates for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of our common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages that large accumulations of stock might provide.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors and the reduced disclosures may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (\"JOBS Act\"). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which include, among other things:\n\u2022\nexemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022\nexemption from the requirements of holding non-binding stockholder votes on executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022\nexemption from any rules of the Public Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis and, unless the SEC otherwise determines, any future audit rules that may be adopted by the PCAOB.\nWe could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of the spin-off date, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date on which we have, during the previous three year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the federal securities laws. We will qualify as a large accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700 million in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates and (ii) been public for at least 12 months. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are also permitted to elect to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards until companies that are not subject to periodic reporting obligations are required to comply with those standards, if such accounting standards apply to non-reporting companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with those of another public company which is neither (i) an emerging growth company nor (ii) an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 16920, "SIC": 3630, "TIC": "HBB"}
