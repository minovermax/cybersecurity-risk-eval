{"cik": "1739104", "company": "Elanco Animal Health Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the risks described below. If any of such risks actually materializes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Elanco's Business and Industry\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive.\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include standalone animal health businesses, the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies, specialty animal health businesses and companies that mainly produce generic products. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Several new start-up companies also compete in the animal health industry. We also face competition from manufacturers of drugs globally, as well as producers of nutritional health products. These competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling their products, initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities. Further, consolidation in the animal health industry could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities, thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition. For example, many of our competitors have relationships with key distributors and, because of their size, the ability to offer attractive pricing incentives, which may negatively impact or hinder our relationships with these distributors. In addition to competition from established market participants, new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share, render our products obsolete or disrupt our business model.\nTo the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, more favorable safety and efficacy product profiles, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale, the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us.\nDisruptive innovation and advances in veterinary medical practices, animal health technologies and alternatives to animal-derived protein could negatively affect the market for our products.\nThe markets for our products are regularly impacted by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d health products, specially bred disease-resistant animals or replacements for meat, milk, eggs or fish from alternative natural or synthetic sources. For example, the market for our pet health therapeutics has been particularly affected by innovation in new molecules and delivery formulations in recent years. Technological breakthroughs by others may render obsolete our products and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of competing animal health products and innovation or disruptive protein alternatives could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory restrictions and bans on the use of antibiotics and productivity products in farm animals, as well as changing market demand, may continue to negatively affect demand for certain of our farm animal products.\nOver the past few years, our operational results have been, and may continue to be, affected by regulations and changing market demand. In certain markets, including the U.S., sales of certain of our farm animal products have been negatively affected by an increase in consumer sentiment for proteins and dairy products produced without the use of antibiotics or other products intended to increase animal production.\n2021 Form 10-K | 22\nThere are two classes of antibiotics used in animal health: shared-class, or medically important, antibiotics, which are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in both humans and animals; and animal-only antibiotics, which are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in animals only. See \u201cBusiness of Elanco - Products - Antibiotics.\u201d Concerns that the use of antibiotics in farm animal production may lead to increased antibiotic resistance of human pathogens have resulted in increased regulation and changing market demand. In December 2013, the FDA announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase-out in the U.S. over a three-year period of the use of shared-class antibiotics in animal feed or water for growth promotion in farm animal production. The guidance allows for continued use of shared-class antibiotics in food-producing animals under the supervision of a veterinarian for treatment, control and, under certain circumstances, for prevention of disease. The FDA indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of shared-class antibiotics to treat infections in humans. As of January 1, 2017, under the FDA\u2019s guidance and the related rule known as the Veterinary Feed Directive, the use of shared-class antibiotics in the water or feed of food-producing animals requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian. In June 2021, the FDA announced final guidance establishing procedures for drug sponsors to make similar changes to the approved marketing status of all other dosage forms of shared-class antibiotics to permit their use only under the supervision of a veterinarian, and only when necessary for treatment, control or prevention of specific diseases. The only products we currently market that are impacted by this guidance are Tylan\u2122 200 and Tylan\u2122 50, which will be transitioned from over-the-counter to prescription status. In addition, other countries in which we sell or plan to sell our products, such as France and Vietnam, have passed restrictions or bans on antibiotic use. Other countries have placed restrictions or bans on the use of specific antibiotics in certain food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable).\nFrom 2015 to 2021, our revenue from shared-class antibiotics has declined at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. This was driven primarily by changing regulations in many markets, including the Veterinary Feed Directive, as well as changing market demand and our tiered approach to antibiotic stewardship, which included removing growth promotion from labels and requiring veterinary oversight in the U.S. and other markets. Globally, during 2021, our revenue from shared-class antibiotics increased approximately 36%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, but represented 9% (3% from sales in the U.S. and 6% from international sales) of total revenue, down from 16% in 2015. The increase was driven by of the addition of Bayer Animal Health product revenue. From 2015 to 2021, our revenue from animal-only antibiotics increased at a CAGR of less than 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. During 2021, our revenue from animal-only antibiotics increased approximately 18%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, and represented 14% of total revenue, down from 23% in 2015. In 2021, 12% of our revenue from animal-only antibiotics resulted from the sale of ionophores. Ionophores are a special class of animal-only antimicrobials, and because of their animal-only designation, mode of action and spectrum of activity, their use has not to date been impacted by regulations or changing market demand in many international markets.\nThe impact of changes in regulations and market preferences regarding the use of antibiotics in farm animals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is an increased public perception that consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products poses a risk to human health, there may be a further decline in the production of those food products and, in turn, demand for our products. In addition, antibiotic resistance concerns will likely result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations or public pressure to further reduce the use of antibiotics in farm animals, increased demand for antibiotic-free protein, or changes in the market acceptance or regulatory treatment of ionophores, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our revenue has been impacted by changing trade dynamics with China and other markets that restrict the use of productivity products, such as those containing ractopamine, in farm animals. This has resulted in many U.S. food producers eliminating their use of ractopamine to gain access to those markets. Our farm animal products Optaflexx\u2122 and Paylean\u2122 contain ractopamine. If more producers decide to access such markets or additional markets restrict the use of ractopamine or other productivity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n2021 Form 10-K | 23\nGeneric products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.\nWe face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. We depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the jurisdictions where such patents are obtained. The extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents, the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable jurisdiction. Some of our top products such as Rumensin, Maxiban, Denagard and Tylan Premix do not have patent protection. Other products are protected by patents that expire over the next several years. As the patents for a brand name product expire, competitors may begin to introduce generic or other alternatives, and as a result, we may face competition from lower-priced alternatives to many of our products. For example, we have experienced significant competitive headwinds from generic ractopamine in the U.S. In the third quarter of 2013, a large established animal health company received U.S. approval for generic ractopamine. U.S. revenue from Optaflexx, our ractopamine beef product, has declined at a compound annual growth rate of 18% from 2015 to 2021 as a result of generic competition and international regulatory restrictions. In the third quarter of 2019, an established animal health company received U.S. approval for generic monensin in cattle and goats for certain indications. U.S. revenue from Rumensin, our monensin product, declined at a compound annual growth rate of 3% from 2015 to 2021 partly due to competition and may continue to decline as a result of the generic competition. We may face similar competition in the future for existing products that do not benefit from exclusivity or for existing products with material patents expiring in the future. See \"Item 1. Business - Intellectual Property.\u201d\nGeneric competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching products before patent rights expire, and, because of attractive pricing, sales of generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. Although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health, product pricing and the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics, such as channel expansion, consolidation, an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses. If animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve targeted cost efficiencies and gross margin improvements.\nWe are pursuing strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including, but not limited to: improving manufacturing processes, reducing our manufacturing footprint, achieving lean initiatives, consolidating our CMO network, strategically insourcing projects, pursuing cost savings opportunities through alternate sources of supply and improving the productivity of our sales force. Following the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, we have announced restructuring programs which have included the elimination of positions across several countries, primarily in sales and marketing, research & development, manufacturing and quality, and back-office support. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these restructuring programs, including costly expenses related to severance, asset impairment and other charges as well as business disruption, loss of accumulated knowledge and procedural efficiency, failure to achieve some or all of the benefits of the restructuring programs, lawsuits arising from the restructuring programs, and the need for a significant amount of management and other employees\u2019 time and focus, which may divert attention from operating the business. We may pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future to improve gross margins and achieve our targeted cost efficiencies. We also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we may not succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, may take several years. We may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\n2021 Form 10-K | 24\nConsolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nThird-party distributors, veterinarians and farm animal producers are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, farm animal producers, particularly swine and poultry producers, and our distributors have seen recent consolidation in their industries. Furthermore, we have seen the expansion of larger cross-border corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). The pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies. If these trends towards consolidation continue, our customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn outbreak of infectious disease carried by farm animals could negatively affect the demand for, and sale and production of, our farm animal products.\nSales of our farm animal products could be materially adversely affected by a general outbreak of infectious disease, or an outbreak of disease carried by farm animals, which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of farm animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. In addition, outbreaks of disease carried by farm animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our farm animal products due to reduced herd or flock sizes.\nIn recent years, outbreaks of various diseases, including African Swine Fever, avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (otherwise known as BSE or \u201cmad cow\u201d disease) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (otherwise known as PEDV) have negatively impacted sales of our animal health products. The discovery of additional cases of any of these, or new, diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal protein, reduced herd or flock sizes, or reduced demand for animal protein, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, our future results of operations and our overall financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may further impact the U.S. and the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. There continues to be uncertainty around its duration, ultimate impact and the timing of recovery. Therefore, the pandemic has led to extended disruptions, and could continue to result in further disruptions, of economic activity and the impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material.\nAs a result of the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our economy and the economies in the countries in which we operate, the pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our supply chain as we experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. Prolonged shortages or supply chain disruptions may result in higher shipping costs, lower production levels or R&D delays, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n2021 Form 10-K | 25\nOur customers, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. With respect to our farm animal business, our livestock customers have been and may continue to be challenged by processing plant shutdowns, travel bans, quarantines inhibiting consumption of protein and the transportation of livestock, and labor shortages, which, in turn, have led and may lead to a further decrease in demand for our customers\u2019 livestock. For example, an effort by dairy farmers to decrease milk production could negatively impact demand for Rumensin. Such challenges could not only lead to a decrease in demand for our products but could also significantly impact our customers' ability to pay for our products. COVID-19 also impacted our pet health business, as social distancing guidelines decreased veterinary visits and reduced veterinary practice spending in the middle of 2020; however, spending returned to normal levels in most regions by the end of the year. We expect the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue to continue until conditions impacting the economy and life in general improve.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. Additionally, our suppliers and third-party distributors may face difficulties maintaining operations and normal liquidity in light of government-mandated restrictions. Further, the resulting global economic downturn may negatively impact the ability of certain of our customers to make payments on a timely basis, adversely impacting our cash flows from operations. While our liquidity has not been significantly impacted by delayed collections thus far, we do not yet know the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic impact, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations and business.\nOur R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products.\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition, including the acquisitions of Bayer Animal Health and KindredBio. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nWe may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. In addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations. The animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into other markets. Furthermore, the timing and cost of our R&D may increase, and our R&D may become less predictable as, among other things, regulations applicable to our industry may make it more time-consuming and/or costly to research, develop and register products. If we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nAs part of our development strategy, we often hire clinical research organizations to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug candidates. Clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be enrolled or completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product or indication. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our prospects. Furthermore, unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market\u2019s view of our future prospects.\n2021 Form 10-K | 26\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\nOur products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species. There may be increased risk of product liability claims if veterinarians, farm animal producers, pet owners or others attempt to use our products off-label, including the use of our products in species (including humans) for which they have not been approved. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those for which our products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for off-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices, and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns or identified concerns associated with our products may harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our performance.\nUnanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns arise from time to time with respect to animal health products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, potentially leading to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims. Regulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all, or a significant portion, of a product\u2019s sales.\nFor example, lawsuits seeking actual damages, injunctive relief, and/or restitution for allegedly deceptive marketing have been filed against us arising out of the use of Seresto, a non-prescription flea and tick collar for cats and dogs, based on reports alleging that the collar has caused injury and death to pets. Further, a U.S. House of Representatives' subcommittee chair requested that we produce certain documents and information related to the Seresto collar and further made a request to temporarily remove Seresto collars from the market. Similar actions relating to Seresto could be taken by regulatory agencies. If any such claims with respect to Seresto or our other products are resolved adversely to us, or if a regulatory agency determines that a recall of any of our products, including Seresto, is necessary, such action could cause harm to our reputation, reduce our product sales, result in monetary penalties and other costly remedies against us, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products in general, by food producers, veterinarians and pet owners. Any concern as to the safety, quality or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation. These concerns, including those relating to Seresto, and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.\nOur business results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and the extent of such fluctuations may be unpredictable.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated during the year, and we expect these fluctuations to continue. For example, on average, approximately 70% and 60% of total annual revenue contribution from our higher-margin parasiticide products Seresto and Advantage Family, respectively, occurs in the first half of the year. This dynamic is reflective of the flea and tick season in the Northern Hemisphere and our growing pet health portfolio.\nOther factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are:\n\u2022weather conditions and the availability of natural resources;\n\u2022increased or decreased inventory levels at our channel distributors;\n\u2022timing of customer orders and deliveries;\n\u2022competitive changes, such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make;\n\u2022timing of marketing programs and events; and\n2021 Form 10-K | 27\n\u2022availability of veterinarians to use our products, as there are seasonal impacts, due to veterinarian vacations or training events that limit their ability to serve their customers that result in the use of our products.\nFor more detailed information on some of the above-listed factors that can cause fluctuations in our operating results, see risks described below under \"Our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources\" and \"Increased or decreased inventory levels at our channel distributors can lead to fluctuations in our revenues and variations in our payment terms extended to our distributors can impact our cash flows.\"\nAccordingly, the fluctuations in our revenues due to seasonality and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, mean period-to-period comparisons of our historical results are not necessarily meaningful. Investors should not rely on such fluctuations as an indication of our future performance. To the extent that we experience the factors described above, our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources.\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions (including those that may be related to climate change), varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nFarm animal producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. Their animals\u2019 health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians or farm animal producers may purchase less of our products.\nFurther, heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production. Droughts may threaten pasture and feed supplies by reducing the quality and amount of forage available to grazing livestock, while climate change may increase the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect farm animals. Adverse weather conditions may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business. Changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases.\nIn addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from, and access to, the animals under their care. Veterinarians\u2019 patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other severe weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather.\nModification of foreign trade policy may harm our farm animal product customers.\nChanges in laws, agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers\u2019 businesses and adversely affect our results of operations. A number of our customers rely on duty reduction benefits provided by free trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Agreement. However, trade partnerships and treaties can be modified by domestic and foreign governments, which could result in new or increased tariffs. Additionally, countries are becoming increasingly protectionist, both to protect local industries as well as to ensure domestic supply chain continuity for key products, such as medicine. Finally, as global security decreases, more countries will use sanctions and export controls as a method to deal with such insecurity, which could result in decreased markets for our products.\n2021 Form 10-K | 28\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur results are reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. To the extent that revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. Given the volatility of exchange rates and despite the mitigating impact of foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts we enter into in order to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates in future periods, there is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products.\nIf any of our top products experience issues, such as disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective competitive products, negative publicity, changes to veterinarian or customer preferences, loss of patent protection, material product liability litigation, new or unexpected side effects, manufacturing disruptions and/or regulatory proceedings, our revenue could be negatively impacted, perhaps significantly. Our top five products, Seresto, Rumensin, Advantix, Advocate, and Interceptor Plus contributed approximately 24% of our revenue in 2021. Any issues with these top products, particularly Rumensin, which contributed approximately 5% of our revenue in 2021 and is now subject to generic competition in the U.S., could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income, as well as a lack of availability or significant increases in the cost of raw materials used in manufacturing our products, could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and operating results.\nFeed, fuel, transportation and other key costs for farm animal producers may continue to increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease. Either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our farm animal product customers, potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered. Our farm animal product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products, including by switching to lower-cost alternatives. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lower-cost alternatives to our products, which could result in a decrease in sales of our pet health products, especially in developed countries where there are higher rates of pet ownership. Rising costs or reduced income for our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to source many of our raw materials and to manufacture products that we distribute. See \"Item 1. Business - Manufacturing and Supply Chain.\" We have and may continue to experience cost increases in certain raw materials or other components required to manufacture our products due to increased shipping costs and other inflationary pressures. This may have a material adverse impact on our financial results if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers. Further, the unavailability or delivery delays of raw materials has affected and could continue to affect our ability to ship the related products timely, more severely impacting high-volume or high-margin products.\nFor our pet health products, increased use of alternative distribution channels, or changes within existing distribution channels, could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, pet owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. However, pet owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years. Pet owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on internet-based animal health information. Because we market our pet health prescription products primarily through the veterinarian distribution channel, any significant decrease in visits to veterinarians by pet owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pet owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\n2021 Form 10-K | 29\nLegislation has also been proposed in the U.S., and may be proposed in the U.S. or abroad in the future, which could impact the distribution channels for our pet health products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our pet health products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the American Veterinary Medical Association has long-standing policies in place to encourage this practice.\nOver time, these and other competitive conditions may further increase our use of online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our pet health products. We may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our pet health products if an increased portion of our sales occur through these channels. Also, we may realize lower margins on sales through these distribution channels than we do on sales through veterinarians. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if one or more of our pet health distributors discontinues or modifies their relationship with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For example, in 2020, we completed the previously communicated channel inventory reduction, moving to inventory levels across the world and across species that represent the minimum necessary to allow our distributors to maintain strong service levels with their end customers.\nIncreased or decreased inventory levels at our channel distributors can lead to fluctuations in our revenues and variations in payment terms extended to our distributors can impact our cash flows.\nIn addition to selling our products directly to veterinarians, we sell to distributors who, in turn, sell our products to third parties. Inventory levels at our distributors may increase or decrease as a result of various factors, including end customer demand, new customer contracts, heightened and generic competition, required minimum inventory levels, our ability to renew distribution contracts with expected terms, our ability to implement commercial strategies, regulatory restrictions, unexpected customer behavior, proactive measures taken by us in response to shifting market dynamics, and procedures and environmental factors beyond our control, including weather conditions or an outbreak of infectious disease such as COVID-19 or diseases carried by farm animals such as African Swine Fever. These increases and decreases can lead to variations in our quarterly and annual revenues. In addition, like all companies that manufacture and sell products, we have policies that govern the payment terms that we extend to our customers. Due to consolidation amongst our distributors, as well as changes in the buying habits of end customers or the need for certain inventory levels at our distributors to avoid supply disruptions, from time to time, our distributors have requested exceptions to the payment term policies that we extend to them. Extensions of customer payment terms can impact our cash flows, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of December 31, 2021, we had recorded on our balance sheet goodwill of $6.2 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $5.6 billion. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of marketed products acquired or licensed from third parties, licensed platform technologies that have alternative future uses in R&D, manufacturing technologies, and customer relationships from business combinations. We also have indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of acquired in-process R&D projects from business combinations that are subject to impairment and non-cash impairment charges.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management\u2019s valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and write-downs recorded on our consolidated balance sheets could vary if our management\u2019s conclusions change. Any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2021 Form 10-K | 30\nOur R&D relies on evaluations of animals, which may become subject to bans, additional restrictive regulations or increased attention from activism movements.\nAs an animal health medicines and vaccines business, we are required to evaluate the effect of our existing and new products in animals in order to register such products. Animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of new regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our R&D, and by extension our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation. For example, farm animal producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights, nutrition, health-related or other concerns. Any reputational harm to the farm animal industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including our company. Adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in farm animals also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nManufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.\nIn order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship sufficient quantities to our customers. We own and operate 20 internal manufacturing sites located in 12 countries. We also employ a network of approximately 140 third-party CMOs. Many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites.\nMinor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result, and have in the past resulted in, delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including:\n\u2022the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers, including logistical service providers, to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines;\n\u2022mislabeling;\n\u2022construction delays;\n\u2022equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022shortages of materials;\n\u2022labor problems;\n\u2022natural disasters;\n\u2022power outages;\n\u2022criminal and terrorist activities;\n\u2022changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and\n\u2022the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near our production sites.\nThese interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product\u2019s regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.\n2021 Form 10-K | 31\nWe have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants. These types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project and require licensing by or approvals from various regulatory authorities. Significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal matters.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal matters. These matters may include, among other things, allegations of violation of U.S. and foreign competition law, labor laws, securities laws and regulations, consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations, as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. For example, shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed against us in 2020 allege, in part, that we and certain of our executives made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose certain facts about our supply chain, inventory, revenue, projections and our relationships with third party distributors and revenue attributable to those distributors. We intend to vigorously defend the claims made in these lawsuits; however, the ultimate resolution cannot be predicted, and the claims raised in these lawsuits may result in further legal matters or actions against us, including, but not limited to, government enforcement actions or additional private litigation. In addition, changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject, or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our exposure to liability. For example, in the U.S., attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of, or injury to, a pet. If such attempts were successful, our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially.\nAlso, on July 1, 2021, we received a subpoena from the SEC relating to our channel inventory and sales practices prior to mid-2020. We have been responding to requests for documents and information from the SEC and will continue to do so. We believe that our actions were appropriate. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether the SEC investigation will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, enforcement actions, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or members of our senior management.\nLitigation matters and regulatory investigations, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management\u2019s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future legal matters. An adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in us being responsible for significant damages. Any of these negative effects resulting from litigation, regulatory investigations and other legal matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards or litigation claims.\nWe rely on a combination of insurance and self-insurance, and changes in predictions, assumptions, and interpretations could affect our operations. Insurance policies include limits and may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks or litigation claims. Our product liability insurance policy may not fully cover our potential liabilities. In addition, we may determine that we should increase our coverage, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our collaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities.\n2021 Form 10-K | 32\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation.\nAs a global company, we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations, including regulations relating to the development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, distribution, marketing, sale of our products. In addition, our manufacturing facilities, including the manufacturing facilities operated by our CMOs, are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies. An inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements. Our failure, or the failure of third parties we rely on, including CMOs, to comply with these regulatory requirements, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in, among other things, inspection observation notices, warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence, fines, a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market, and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims. Any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products. Even after a product reaches market, we may be subject to re-review and may lose our approvals. For example, pending claims have been asserted in a lawsuit against the FDA's approval of Experior\u2122, which was one of our eight new product launches in 2021. Our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or re-approval is obtained, if ever.\nIn the EU, the Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulation updated the rules related to the authorization and use of veterinary medicines effective January 28, 2022. The updated rules limit the use of antibiotics, tighten importation rules, and impose stricter pharmacovigilance standards. This regulation must still be implemented at the member state level and as such, additional requirements may be adopted by individual member states which would have the effect of increasing the compliance requirements for our business in the EU with resulting costs.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or other material foreign jurisdictions, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n2021 Form 10-K | 33\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen, diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening to animals. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent and/or which are sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory, warehouses, plants or while in transit, which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact animal health and safety, our reputation and our business. With the acquisition of the Bayer Animal Health business, we have now expanded our business more into direct to retailer and e-commerce channels in order to meet the pet owners where they want to purchase, which may increase the risk of counterfeiting of our products. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting, illegal compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.\nGiven the nature of our business, we have incurred, are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities for the investigation and remediation of contaminated land under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or under other federal, state, local and foreign environmental cleanup laws, with respect to our current or former sites, adjacent or nearby third-party sites, or offsite disposal locations. We could be subject to liability for the investigation and remediation of legacy environmental contamination caused by historical industrial activity as sites that we own or on which we operate. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury, property damage and natural resource damages, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment. Such liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and farm animal operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny has in the past and may in the future necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products.\nOur failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials, environmental damage or significant environmental, health and safety issues that might arise at a manufacturing or R&D facility. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation. It is possible that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2021 Form 10-K | 34\nThe actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.\nA third party may sue us, or our distributors or licensors, or otherwise make a claim alleging infringement or other violation of such third-party\u2019s patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. If our distributors, licensors or we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022pay monetary damages;\n\u2022obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022stop activities, including any commercial activities, relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales in the future.\nThe costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, even if we successfully defend such claim. Moreover, even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing third-party patent, we may choose to license such patent, which would result in associated costs and obligations. We may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to indemnify a distributor, licensor or other third party.\nThe intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. For example, while we generally enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees and third parties, which assign intellectual property rights to us, these agreements may not be honored or may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us under the local laws of some countries or jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would otherwise be able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our R&D efforts or harm the value of our brands.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to market innovative, competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, if at all. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents, or any patents that may issue in the future, may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.\nThe validity and scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. For example, some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself, and its first use, and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that vary based on the local law of the relevant jurisdiction. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country\u2019s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. Patent protection must be obtained on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and we only pursue patent protection in countries where we think it makes commercial sense for the given product. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements terminate, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n2021 Form 10-K | 35\nPatent law reform in the U.S. and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive. The America Invents Act permits enhanced third-party actions for challenging patents and implements a first-to-invent system. These reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products in these jurisdictions. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur trademarks and brands may provide us with a competitive advantage in the market as they may be known or trusted by consumers. In order to maintain the value of such brands, we must be able to enforce and defend our trademarks. We have pursued and will pursue the registration of trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally; however, enforcing rights against those who knowingly or unknowingly dilute or infringe our brands can be difficult. Effective trademark, service mark, trade dress or related protections may not be available in every country in which our products and services are available. Enforcement is especially difficult in first-to-file countries where \u201ctrademark squatters\u201d can prevent us from obtaining adequate protections for our brands. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken and will take to protect our proprietary rights in our brands and trademarks will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe, dilute or misappropriate our brands, trademarks, trade dress or other similar proprietary rights.\nMany of our products are based on or incorporate proprietary information. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by generally requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\nSignificant portions of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.\nOur international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:\n\u2022volatility in the international financial markets;\n\u2022changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar or high inflation;\n\u2022compliance with governmental controls;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022parallel trade in our products (importation of our products from EU countries where our products are sold at lower prices into EU countries where the products are sold at higher prices);\n\u2022compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with foreign labor laws;\n\u2022compliance with local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in emerging markets;\n\u2022burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements and those in emerging markets;\n\u2022changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers, including the imposition of limits on our profitability;\n\u2022political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armed conflicts such as the recent crisis in Ukraine;\n2021 Form 10-K | 36\n\u2022trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the EU, in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers;\n\u2022government limitations on foreign ownership;\n\u2022government takeover or nationalization of business;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and tariffs;\n\u2022imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions;\n\u2022costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations, including in the use of overseas third-party goods and service providers;\n\u2022corruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk;\n\u2022continued uncertainty, potential instability and volatility due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; and\n\u2022additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information.\nIn addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs, as well as restrictions and sanctions that may be imposed on one or more jurisdictions, including those arising from the recent crisis in Ukraine. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technologies. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products, and damage to our reputation. In addition, variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized re-importation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.\nWe are continuing to enhance a number of our business processes, including our financial reporting and supply chain processes and with respect to where and from whom we obtain information technology systems. We have made and will continue to make significant configuration, process and data changes within many of the information technology systems we use. If our information technology systems and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions, or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes, our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to successfully configure and change our systems, all technology systems, even with implementation of security measures, are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached, this could materially adversely affect our reputation and our ability to perform critical business functions, and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.\n2021 Form 10-K | 37\nBreaches of our information technology systems or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data, or a failure to comply with privacy laws, regulations and our contractual obligations concerning data privacy or the security of certain information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including customer, employee and company data. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. In addition, the legal environment surrounding information security, storage, use, processing, transmission, maintenance, disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing regulatory requirements.\nWe store, process, and transmit certain information with third parties, including the use of cloud technologies. Our information systems and those of our third-party vendors are subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks and are also vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and external hazards, as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior. Any potential cyber breach could result in the unauthorized access, public disclosure, loss or theft of confidential data, or unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our operations that rely on information systems. Such breach can also have negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, and diversion of management attention.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems as our office workers, who are primarily working remotely, rely on third-party applications to perform their job duties and are processing information through our network via their home networks, which may be less secure. As such, our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our technology systems and data and the ability of our employees to follow our cyber security policies and protocols.\nAny actual or perceived access, disclosure or other loss of information or any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, cyber-attack or corruption of customer, employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws or contractual obligations with customers, vendors, payment processors and other third parties, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws or contracts that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations, and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, revenue and competitive position. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect cyber-incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Our protective measures may not protect us against attacks and such attacks could have a significant impact on our business and reputation.\nIncreased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of farm animals could reduce demand for our farm animal products.\nCompanies in the farm animal sector are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. See \"Item 1. Business - Regulatory\" for further discussion. If farm animal producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations, they may reduce herd or flock sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many farm animal producers benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our farm animal products. More stringent regulation of the farm animal sector, including regarding the use of farm animal products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages.\nSome of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages, higher ongoing labor costs or other labor problems in the future at our sites. We may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets.\n2021 Form 10-K | 38\nFurther, labor-related issues, including at our suppliers or CMOs, could cause a disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income.\nA loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations.\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our highly qualified and well-trained key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. We face intense competition for these qualified personnel from our competitors and others, particularly for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit or identify suitable replacement personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed. In addition, if we fail to effectively manage organizational and/or strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed.\nWe have underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require current and future operating cash flow to fund these shortfalls, reducing the cash available for other uses.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension plans, predominantly in Germany and Switzerland, that our employees participate in that are either dedicated to our employees or where the plan assets and liabilities that relate to our employees were legally required to transfer to us at the time of our separation from Lilly. The funded status and net periodic pension cost for these plans is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2021, for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $455 million with plan assets of $200 million. Any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years. The need to make additional cash contributions will divert resources from our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Divestitures\nWe may not be able to successfully complete favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses when we pursue acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other significant transactions.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, such as the proposed carve-out of our microbiome R&D platform, that would further our strategic objectives. The completion of such transactions is often subject to conditions that may be outside our control, including obtaining the requisite approval of the stockholders of the target company and/or government approval pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete announced and signed transactions and therefore not realize the anticipated benefits therefrom.\nAfter the closing of an acquisition, including the transaction with KindredBio, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the portfolio and operations of the target company. Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process, including as a result of distraction of our management, include the following:\n\u2022the inability to realize the anticipated value from various assets of the target company;\n\u2022the inability to combine the businesses of the acquired company with ours in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings or other synergies anticipated as a result of the transaction or to achieve such cost savings or other anticipated synergies in a timely manner, which could result in us not realizing some anticipated benefits of the transaction in the time frame anticipated, or at all;\n2021 Form 10-K | 39\n\u2022loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or unfavorable conditions in connection with the closing of the transaction and the subsequent integration; and\n\u2022performance shortfalls at our or the target company as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business activities as a result of completing the transaction and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nIn the case of our announcement regarding our intention to carve-out our microbiome R&D platform, the terms, timing and structure of any such separation of this platform, or whether the separation can be completed at all, remain uncertain, as is our ability to achieve any operational and strategic benefits from the separation. In the meantime, the uncertainty of announcing the separation initiative may adversely impact potential customers and suppliers related to the microbiome R&D platform.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, if we sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public markets, the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the Bayer Animal Health business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nThe successful integration of the Bayer Animal Health business and operations into those of our own and our ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. We will also be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices, cultures and operations of each business. The risks and uncertainties relating to integrating the two businesses and realizing the anticipated cost synergies include, among other things:\n\u2022the inability to achieve the anticipated revenue, earnings, accretion and other benefits due to the impact of the COVID-19 global health pandemic;\n\u2022the challenge of integrating complex organizations, systems, including the enterprise resource planning system upon which the Bayer Animal Health business is currently operating, operating procedures, compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets of the Bayer Animal Health business;\n\u2022the difficulties harmonizing differences in the business cultures of our company and the Bayer Animal Health business;\n\u2022the inability to combine successfully our respective businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings, synergies and other anticipated benefits from the acquisition;\n\u2022the inability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns during the process of integrating the Bayer Animal Health business into our business;\n\u2022the inability to resolve potential conflicts that may arise relating to customer, supplier and other important relationships of our business and the Bayer Animal Health business;\n\u2022the inability to transfer agreements relating to customers, suppliers and other important relationships of the Bayer Animal Health business;\n\u2022the challenge of managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company and coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022difficulties in fully exploring intellectual property licensed from Bayer in connection with the acquisition, given Bayer's rights as licensor of such intellectual property.\n2021 Form 10-K | 40\nWe have incurred substantial expenses to consummate and will continue to incur substantial expenses to integrate the acquisition but may not realize the anticipated cost synergies and other benefits to the extent expected, on the timeline expected, or at all. In addition, even if we are able to integrate the Bayer Animal Health business successfully, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, competition in the animal health industry, including competition that has negatively impacted results in the pet health parasiticide market, may also cause us not to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Given the size and significance of the acquisition, we may encounter difficulties in the integration of the operations of the Bayer Animal Health business and may fail to realize the full benefits and synergies of the acquisition, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo ensure business continuity after the transfer of the Bayer Animal Health business, we entered into transitional services agreements and other long-term agreements with Bayer. Bayer\u2019s performance of its obligations under such long-term agreements is important to our transition of the Bayer Animal Health business. Our inability to resolve conflicts with Bayer that may arise under those long-term agreements could compromise our ability to successfully integrate the Bayer Animal Health business. We may also encounter difficulties in securing another vendor to provide us with those same services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9: Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOur high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements, including dividends;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022making us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may in the future be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry;\n\u2022impacting our effective tax rate; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\n2021 Form 10-K | 41\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future, even following the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health. Although the terms of the credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions do not prevent us from incurring other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition to our borrowings under our credit facilities, the covenants under the credit agreement governing our credit facilities are expected to, and the covenants under any other of our existing or future debt instruments could, allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and, subject to certain limitations, such additional indebtedness could be secured. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under \u201c-We have substantial indebtedness.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make adequate distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit facilities contain, and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n2021 Form 10-K | 42\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans or certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022create liens on certain assets;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022substantially alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, certain of our credit facilities require us to comply with a net total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA failure to comply with the covenants under the indenture that governs the senior unsecured notes and credit facilities, or any of our other existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of an event of default under our credit facilities, it is expected that the lenders:\n\u2022will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit;\n\u2022could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes (due to a cash sweep feature).\nSuch actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness, including our senior unsecured notes. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facilities and any of our other existing or future secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our credit facilities or such other indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities.\nChanges in our credit rating could increase our interest expense and restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on us and certain of our debt. As a result of the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, our credit ratings were downgraded, resulting in increased borrowing costs. Because the ratings of certain of our senior unsecured notes have been downgraded, we are required to pay additional interest under the senior unsecured notes. Any further downgrades could result in requirements to pay additional interest under the senior unsecured notes. Moreover, any decision to downgrade our ratings could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings and trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials or other vendors.\n2021 Form 10-K | 43\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flows.\nCertain of our credit facilities bear interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the FCA Announcement). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark.\nIn March 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the FCA, formally announced that LIBOR will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is the preferred alternative to U.S. LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR; however, there are presently many variations of SOFR, and it is unknown whether these or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance.\nSOFR measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Although our credit facilities provide for successor base rates, the discontinuance of LIBOR and the introduction of alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, could cause the interest rates calculated on our floating-rate debt and interest rate swaps to be materially different than expected.\nRisks Related to Elanco Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. We intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt. Certain of our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be our stockholders' major source of gain for the foreseeable future. While we may change this policy at some point in the future, we cannot assure you that we will make such a change.\nThe distributions we pay on our common stock may not qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning our common stock.\nGenerally, any distributions that we make to a stockholder with respect to its shares of our common stock will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Furthermore, our ability to generate earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any future year is subject to a number of variables that are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGenerally, any distribution not constituting a dividend under the rules described above will be treated as first reducing the investor's adjusted basis in shares of our common stock and, to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis in shares of our common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares, and if the investor is a domestic corporation, it will not be entitled to claim, with respect to such non-dividend distribution, a \u201cdividends-received\u201d deduction, which generally applies to dividends received from other domestic corporations.\n2021 Form 10-K | 44\nApplicable laws and regulations, provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage takeover attempts and business combinations that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nApplicable laws, provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For example, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that are intended to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover, which could deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022a board of directors divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022advance notice requirements regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with such powers, rights and preferences as the board of directors shall determine;\n\u2022only the board of directors to fill newly-created directorships or vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and require that all shareholder action be taken at a meeting rather than by written consent;\n\u2022a 66 2/3% shareholder vote requirement to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to amend our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022the requirement that a 66 2/3% vote is necessary to remove directors.\nThese limitations may adversely affect the prevailing market price and market for our common stock if they are viewed as limiting the liquidity of our stock or discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nWe recently adopted a \u201cproxy access\u201d bylaw, which permits an eligible shareholder or group of shareholders to nominate, and have included in our proxy materials, director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of our board of directors (whichever is greater), subject to the requirements and procedures in our bylaws; and we intend to put forward for shareholder approval at our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders a proposal to remove the 66 2/3% voting requirements in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and replace them with a majority standard. However, there can be no assurance that the requisite shareholder vote requirement for such proposal will be obtained, or that any such changes will reduce the risks described above.", "PERMNO": 18062, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ELAN"}
