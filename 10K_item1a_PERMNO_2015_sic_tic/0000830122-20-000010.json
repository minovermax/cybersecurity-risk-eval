{"cik": "830122", "company": "PICO HOLDINGS INC /NEW", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nThe following information sets out factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. Investors should carefully consider the following risks, together with other matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated herein by reference in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, in some cases significantly.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition and, the demand for and the fair value of our assets.\nOur operations are sensitive to the general economic conditions in the local markets in which our assets are located. International, national, and regional economic conditions may also affect our markets. General weak economic conditions and either slow or non-existent rates of growth in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the demand for and value of our water assets. Weak economic conditions include higher unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer demand, changes in buying patterns, a weakened dollar, higher consumer debt levels, higher interest rates, especially higher mortgage rates, higher tax rates, and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect commercial and residential real estate development.\nSpecifically, high national, regional, or local unemployment may arrest or delay growth of the residential and commercial real estate markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect the demand for and value of our water assets. Any prolonged lack of demand for our water assets could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, cash flows, and the return on our investment from these assets.\nOur future revenue is uncertain and depends on a number of factors that may make our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and the fair value of our assets volatile.\nOur future revenue and profitability of our water resource and water storage operations will primarily be dependent on our ability to develop and sell or lease our water assets. Because our water resource and water storage operations represent almost the entirety of our overall business at present, our long-term profitability and the fair value of the assets related to our water resource and water storage operations could be adversely affected by various factors, including drought in the southwest, regulatory approvals and permits associated with such assets, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resource and water storage development projects. Moreover, our profitability, and the fair value of our water resource assets and water storage operations, are significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely, as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic, and technological factors, as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets. Additionally, to the extent that we hold junior or conditional water rights, during extreme climatic conditions, such as periods of low river flow or drought, our water rights could be subordinated to superior water rights holders. The factors described above are not within our control.\nOne or more of the above factors could negatively affect our revenue and profitability, our financial condition and cash flows, cause our results of operations to be volatile, and could adversely affect our rate of return on our water assets and cause us to divest such assets for less than our intended return on our investment.\nA downturn in the homebuilding and land development sectors in our markets would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and the demand for and the fair value of our assets.\nThe homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained downturn in past years, resulting from factors that include, but are not limited to, weak general economic and employment growth, limited access to capital, a lack of consumer confidence, large supplies of resale and foreclosed homes, a significant number of homeowners whose mortgage loan balances exceeded the market value of their homes, and tight lending standards for mortgage loans that limited consumers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home. These factors resulted in an industry-wide weakness in demand for new homes and caused a material adverse effect on the growth of the local economies and the homebuilding industry in the southwestern United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) markets, where all of our water assets are located, including the states of Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The continuation of the improvement in residential and commercial real estate development activity is essential to our ability to generate revenue and operating income in our water resource and water storage business. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent this improvement will continue. Any future slow-down in real estate and homebuilding activity could adversely affect development projects within the markets in which our water assets are located, and could materially affect the demand for and the fair value of our assets and our ability to monetize them. Declines and weak conditions in the U.S. housing market in prior years have reduced our revenues and created losses in our water resource and water storage, and land development and homebuilding businesses and could do so in the future. Additionally, the recent tax law changes limiting, among other things, deductibility of mortgage interest and of state and local income taxes may have a negative effect on the national housing market and in the markets in which we operate, although the Nevada market may be less impacted due to the lack of a state income tax.\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated value of our water assets in our projected time frame, if at all.\nWe expect that the current rate of growth of the economy will continue to have an impact on real estate market fundamentals. Depending on how markets perform in the short and long-term, the state of the economy, nationally and locally where our assets are concentrated, could result in a decline in the value of our existing water assets, or cause us to retain such assets longer than we initially expected, which would negatively affect our rate of return on our water assets, cause us to divest such assets for less than our intended return on investment, or cause us to impair the book values of such assets to estimated fair value. Such events would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe fair values of our water assets are linked to growth factors concerning the local markets in which our assets are concentrated and may be affected by broader economic issues.\nBoth the demand for, and fair value of, our water assets are significantly affected by the growth in population and the general state of the local economies where our real estate and water assets are located. The local economies where our real estate and water assets are located, primarily in Arizona and northern Nevada, but also in southern Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico, may be adversely affected by factors such as the local level of employment, the availability and cost of financing for real estate development, and the affordability of housing. The unemployment rate in these states, as well as credit market conditions, may prolong a slowdown of the local economies where our real estate and water assets are located. These developments, if they occur, could materially and adversely affect the demand for, and the fair value of, our real estate and water assets and, consequently, adversely affect our growth and revenues, results of operations, cash flows, and the return on our investment from these assets.\nThe fair values of our water assets may decrease, which could adversely affect our results of operations with losses from asset impairments.\nThe fair value of our water resource and water storage assets depends on market conditions. We acquired water resources and land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of inventory and expansion within our current markets. The valuation of real estate and water assets is inherently subjective, based on the individual characteristics of each asset and the demand for that asset. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws, political conditions, the condition of financial markets, local and national economic conditions, change in efficiencies of water use, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject our asset valuations to uncertainties. In addition, our valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If population growth and, as a result, water and/or housing demand in our markets, fails to meet our expectations when we acquired our real estate and water assets, our profitability may be adversely affected, and we may be unable to recover our costs when we sell our real estate and water assets. We regularly review the value of our water assets. These reviews have resulted in recording significant impairment losses in prior years to our water resource assets. Such impairments have adversely affected our results of operations and our financial condition in those years.\nIf future market conditions adversely affect the anticipated timing and the volume of sales of our water assets, we may be required to record further significant impairments to the carrying value of our water assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\n* Our water resource and water storage operations are concentrated in a limited number of assets and markets, making the success of our operations highly dependent on the conditions and fluctuations of the local economies where those operations and assets are located.\nWe anticipate that a significant amount of our water resource and water storage revenue, results of operations, and cash flows will result from a limited number of assets, that primarily consist of our water rights in Nevada and our water storage operations in Arizona. Our two most significant assets are our water storage operations in Arizona and our water rights available to serve the north valleys area of Reno, Nevada. As a result of this geographic concentration, we expect the ultimate return on our invested capital, results of operations, and cash flows will be closely associated with the conditions and fluctuations of the local economies, including any changes in local and regional government land use, zoning, permitting approvals and other regulatory actions in these regions. Any economic downturn, or additional permitting, zoning or planning regulatory requirements in these markets, would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and our financial condition.\nOur Arizona Recharge Facility is one of the few private sector water storage sites in Arizona. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 250,682 acre-feet of water stored at the facility. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had approximately 28,350 acre-feet of water stored in the Phoenix Active Management Area. We have not stored any water on behalf of any customers and, as of December 31, 2019, had not generated any material revenue from the recharge facility. We cannot be certain that we will ultimately be able to sell all of the stored water at a price sufficient to provide an adequate economic return, if at all.\nWe constructed a pipeline approximately 35 miles long to deliver water from Fish Springs Ranch to the north valleys area of Reno, Nevada. As of December 31, 2019, the total cost of the pipeline project, including our water credits (net of impairment losses incurred to date), carried on our balance sheet was approximately $81.7 million. To date, we have sold only a small amount of the water credits, and we cannot provide any assurance that the sales prices we may obtain in the future will provide an adequate economic return, if at all. Any prolonged weak demand or lack of permitting approvals for new homes and residential and commercial development would adversely affect our assets in Nevada and Arizona and would have a material adverse effect on our future revenues, results of operations, cash flows, and the return on our investment from those assets. Demand for these water credits is anticipated to come primarily from both local and national developers planning to construct new projects in the north valleys area of Reno, Nevada. The success of these projects is dependent on numerous factors beyond our control, including local government approvals, employment growth in the greater Reno area, and the ability of the developers to finance these projects.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to our assets and the losses resulting from any damage may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims or other tortious conduct, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or uneconomical to insure, or may not be currently, or in the future, covered by our insurance or subject to significant deductibles or limits. If an uninsured loss, or a loss in excess of insured limits, occurs or is subject to a large deductible, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected asset(s), as well as anticipated future income from that asset. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles.\nWe may not receive all of the permitted water rights we expect from the water rights applications we have filed in Nevada and New Mexico.\nWe have filed water rights applications in Nevada and New Mexico. In Nevada the filings are primarily as part of the water teaming agreement with Lincoln County. We deploy the capital required to enable the filed applications to be converted into permitted water rights over time as and when we deem appropriate, or as otherwise required. We expend capital in those areas where our initial investigations lead us to believe that we can obtain a sufficient volume of water to provide an adequate economic return on the capital invested in the project. These capital expenditures largely consist of drilling and engineering costs for water production, costs of monitoring wells, legal and consulting costs for hearings with the relevant State Engineer, and other compliance costs. Until the Nevada State Engineer, or other authority in the relevant state, permits the water rights we are applying for, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be awarded all of the water that we expect based on the results of our drilling and our legal position and it may be a considerable period of time before we are able to ascertain the final volume of water rights, if any, that will be permitted by the Nevada State Engineer or other authority in the relevant state. Any significant reduction in the volume of water awarded to us from our original base expectation of the amount of water that could be permitted may result in the write down of capitalized costs that could adversely affect the return on our investment from those assets, our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows.\nVariances in physical availability of water, along with environmental and legal restrictions and legal impediments, could adversely affect profitability.\nWe value our water assets, in part, based upon the volume (as measured in acre-feet) of water we anticipate from water rights applications and our permitted water rights. Our water and water rights and the transferability of these rights to other uses, persons, and places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico. The volumes of water actually derived from the water rights applications or permitted rights may vary considerably based upon physical availability and may be further limited by applicable legal restrictions, including, with limitation, restrictions on transfer of water rights.\nAs a result, the volume of water anticipated from the water rights applications or permitted rights may not in every case represent a reliable, firm annual yield of water, but in some cases describe the face amount of the water right claims or management\u2019s best estimate of such entitlement. Additionally, we may face legal restrictions on the sale or transfer of some of our water assets, which may adversely affect their commercial value. If the volume of water yielded from our water rights applications is less than our expectations, or we are unable to transfer or sell our water assets, we may be unable to achieve some or all of our anticipated returns, which may adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and cash flows.\nPurchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their obligations to us and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nIn certain circumstances, we finance sales of real estate and water assets, and we secure such financing through deeds of trust on the property, which are only released once the financing has been fully paid. Purchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their financing obligations. Such defaults may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sale of water assets may be subject to environmental regulations which would impact our revenues, profitability, and cash flows.\nThe quality of the water assets we lease or sell may be subject to regulation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, acting pursuant to the United States Safe Drinking Water Act, and with other federal, state and local regulations. While environmental regulations may not directly affect us, regulations regarding the quality of water distributed affect our intended customers and may, therefore, depending on the quality of our water, affect the price and terms upon which we may in the future sell our water assets. If we need to reduce the price of our water assets in order to make sales to our intended customers, our balance sheet, return on investment, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer.\nOur water assets may be adversely affected by legal and political opposition in certain locations.\nThe water assets we hold, and the transferability of these assets and rights to other uses, persons, or places of use, are governed by the laws and regulations concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico, and may be directly or indirectly affected by other federal, state and local laws and regulations related to water and land use. Our development and sale of water assets is subject to the risks of delay associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, or the refusal to issue regulatory approvals or permits, and possible litigation. Additionally, the transfer of water resources from one use to another may affect the economic base or impact other community issues, including development, and will, in some instances, be met with local opposition. Moreover, municipalities who may regulate the use of water we sell to them in order to manage growth could also impose additional requirements that we must satisfy to sell our water assets.\nIf we are unable to effectively transfer, sell, and convey water resources, our ability to monetize those assets will suffer and our return on investment, revenues and financial condition would decline.\nIf our assets decline in value, our financial condition and the return on our investment could suffer.\nHistorically, we have acquired and invested in businesses and assets that we believed were undervalued or that would benefit from additional capital, restructuring of operations, strategic initiatives, or operational efficiencies. If any previously acquired business, investment or asset fails or its fair value declines, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, the results of operations, and cash flows. If we are not successful in managing our previous acquisitions and investments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. Such business failures, declines in the fair value of our assets, and/or failure to manage acquisitions or investments, could result in a negative return on equity. We could also lose part or all of our capital in these businesses and experience reductions in our net income, cash flows, assets and equity.\nFuture dispositions of our businesses, assets, operations and investments, if unsuccessful, could reduce the value of our common stock. Any future dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those historically affecting our financial condition, results of operations, and trading price at the present time.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund our business and financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\nWe currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such resources will be sufficient to fund our business over longer periods. We may be required to raise additional funds through public or private debt, equity, warrants or hybrid securities financings, including, without limitation, the issuance of securities.\nWe may experience difficulty in raising necessary capital in view of the recent volatility in the capital markets and increases in the cost of finance, especially for a small capitalization company like ours. Increasingly stringent rating standards could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, warrants or convertible or other debt securities, the ownership of our shareholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. Indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. The additional financing we may need may not be available to us, or available on favorable terms. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations or otherwise execute our business and operating plan would be significantly limited. In any such case, our business, operating results, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n* Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if our Company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d ((generally defined as a greater than fifty-percent (50%) change in the percentage of stock owned by one or more than five percent (5%) or more shareholders (measured by the relative fair market value of that shareholder\u2019s stock compared to the total value of all outstanding stock, excluding changes in ownership attributable to fluctuations in value between different classes of stock)) as of the testing date, measured over a three year period, or a period beginning with any previous testing date, whichever is shorter, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income may be limited. Notwithstanding our adoption of a tax benefit preservation plan, which was ratified by our shareholders at our 2018 annual meeting, it is possible that we could experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. Furthermore, Section 382 (and other tax code and regulatory provisions) relating to net operating losses have recently been subject to proposed regulations by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service which, if finalized in their current form, may have the effect of further reducing the value of net operating losses, in certain circumstances, for a corporation that undergoes an ownership change. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156.5 million and $140.6 million, respectively, which, depending on ownership changes, could be limited by Section 382 of the Code.\nWe may not be able to retain key management personnel we need to succeed, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our businesses.\nTo run our day-to-day operations and to successfully manage our businesses we must, among other things, continue to retain key management. We rely on the services of a small team of key executive officers. If any key executive departs, it could have a significant adverse effect upon our business. Also, increased competition for skilled management and staff employees in our businesses could cause us to experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability.\nAnalysts and investors may not be able to evaluate us adequately, which may negatively influence the price of our stock.\nWe own assets that are unique, complex in nature, and difficult to understand. In particular, our water resource business is a developing industry in the United States with very little historical and comparable data, complex valuation issues and a limited following of analysts. Because our assets are unique, analysts and investors may be unable to adequately evaluate our operations and enterprise as a going concern. This could cause analysts and investors to make inaccurate evaluations of our stock, or to overlook the Company in general. As a result, the trading volume and price of our stock could suffer and may be subject to excessive volatility.\nFluctuations in the market price of our common stock may affect your ability to sell your shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in financial performance and condition of our various businesses;\n\u2022\nshortfalls in revenue or earnings from estimates forecast by securities analysts or others;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates by such analysts;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monetize our water assets for an adequate economic return, including the length of time any such monetization may take;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other matters described herein;\n\u2022\nthe number of analysts who follow our stock and their understanding of our business; and\n\u2022\nthe volume of trading in our stock.\nOur results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and our future results of operations could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Causes of such fluctuations may include one time transactions and impairment losses. Statements or changes in opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, shareholders or customers could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Additionally, from time to time we or our subsidiaries will have disputes with companies, governmental and tribal entities, special interest groups, or individuals which may result in litigation that could necessitate our management\u2019s attention and require us to expend our resources. We may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure to specific litigation, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to us. We may be forced to resolve litigation in a manner not favorable to us, and such resolution could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have been the subject of shareholder activism efforts that could cause a material disruption to our business.\nIn the past, certain investors took steps to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of our Company due to governance and strategic-related disagreements with us. While we have formally settled with certain of those activists, other investors could take steps to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of our Company. Such shareholder activism efforts could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, harming our business and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more complicated and the removal and replacement of our directors and management more difficult.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions may also make it difficult for stockholders to remove and replace our board of directors and management. For example, these provisions limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. In addition, on July 24, 2017, our board of directors adopted a tax benefits preservation plan designed to preserve our ability to utilize our net operating losses as a result of certain stock ownership changes, which may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership.\nIf equity analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts may publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use our data centers and our networks to store and access our proprietary business information. We face various cyber security threats, including without limitation, cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our proprietary or sensitive information. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The result of these incidents could include disrupted operations, lost opportunities, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation and reputational damage. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\n*Our plan to monetize assets and return capital to our shareholders may lead to a permanent reduction in our market capitalization and adversely affect the trading volume and liquidity for our stock.\nOur current business plan is to monetize our assets and return capital to our shareholders through a stock repurchase program or by other means such as special dividends. Currently we have a stock repurchase program in place and as of December 31, 2019, we had utilized $38.3 million to repurchase approximately 3.4 million of our common shares. As we continue to monetize assets and use the associated sale proceeds for share repurchases or special dividends, it is possible that our market capitalization will permanently decline, which could adversely affect the trading volume and liquidity for our stock. In addition, we are currently a constituent member of the Russell 2000 index, along with other indexes and other indexed products. If we ceased to be represented in the Russell 2000 index, or other indexes or indexed products, as a result of our market capitalization falling below the threshold for inclusion in the index, whether due to a decline in our stock price or a reduction in the number of shares outstanding, or for any other reason, certain institutional shareholders may, due to their internal policies and investment guidelines, be required to sell their shareholdings. Such sales may result in further negative pressure on our stock price and, when combined with reduced trading volume and liquidity, could adversely affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares.\nTHE FOREGOING FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, CASH FLOWS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MAKE COMPARISON OF HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND BALANCES, DIFFICULT OR NOT MEANINGFUL.", "PERMNO": 76586, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "PICO"}
