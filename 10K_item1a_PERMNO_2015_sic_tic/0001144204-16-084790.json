{"cik": "1006269", "company": "LORAL SPACE & COMMUNICATIONS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nI. Financial and Telesat Investment Risk Factors\nTelesat\u2019s profitability may be adversely affected by swings in the global financial markets, which may have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s customers and suppliers.\nSwings in the global financial markets that include illiquidity, market volatility, changes in interest rates and currency exchange fluctuations can be difficult to predict and negatively affect the ability of certain customers to make payments when due. Such swings may materially and adversely affect us due to the potential insolvency of Telesat\u2019s suppliers and customers, inability of customers to obtain financing for their transponder leases, decreased customer demand, delays in supplier performance and contract terminations. Telesat\u2019s customers may not have access to capital or a willingness to spend capital on transponder leases, or their levels of cash liquidity with which to pay for transponder leases may be adversely affected. Access of Telesat\u2019s suppliers to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, production levels or product quality may be adversely affected, which could cause them to raise prices or cease operations. As a result, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These potential effects of swings in the global financial markets are difficult to forecast and mitigate.\nOur equity investment in Telesat may be at risk because of Telesat\u2019s leverage.\nAt December 31, 2015, Telesat had outstanding indebtedness of CAD 4.1 billion, which matures between 2017 and 2019, and additional borrowing capacity of CAD 140 million under its revolving facility, based on a U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.3839. Approximately CAD 3.0 billion of this total borrowing capacity is debt that is secured by substantially all of the assets of Telesat. This indebtedness represents a significant amount of indebtedness for a company the size of Telesat. The agreements governing this indebtedness impose operating and financial restrictions on Telesat\u2019s activities. These restrictions on Telesat\u2019s ability to operate its business could seriously harm its business by, among other things, limiting its ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities, which could in time adversely affect the value of our investment in Telesat.\nBorrowings under Telesat\u2019s senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose Telesat to interest rate risk. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a CAD 5 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities. Telesat has entered into, and in the future it may enter into, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. Telesat may not, however, maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all or any of its variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps Telesat enters into may not fully mitigate its interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Telesat\u2019s debt denominated in U.S. dollars was $2.6 billion, all of which was unhedged with respect to foreign exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates impact the amount that Telesat pays in interest and may significantly increase the amount that Telesat is required to pay in Canadian dollar terms to redeem the indebtedness either at maturity, or earlier if redemption rights are exercised or other events occur which require Telesat to offer to purchase the indebtedness prior to maturity, and to repay funds drawn under its US-dollar denominated facility. Unfavorable exchange rate changes could affect Telesat\u2019s ability to repay or refinance this debt.\nA breach of the covenants contained in any of Telesat\u2019s loan agreements, including without limitation, a failure to maintain the financial ratios required under such agreements, could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, Telesat\u2019s lenders would be able to accelerate repayment of the related indebtedness, and it may also trigger a cross default under other Telesat indebtedness.\nIf Telesat is unable to repay or refinance its secured indebtedness when due (whether at the maturity date or upon acceleration as a result of a default), the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which consists of substantially all of the assets of Telesat and its subsidiaries. Telesat\u2019s ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, will depend largely upon its future operating performance and market conditions. Disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult to renew or extend Telesat\u2019s facilities at current commitment levels on similar terms or at all. In the event that Telesat is not able to service or refinance its indebtedness, there would be a material adverse effect on the value of our equity investment in Telesat.\nTelesat\u2019s financial results and our U.S. dollar reporting of Telesat\u2019s financial results will be affected by volatility in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nPortions of Telesat\u2019s revenue, expenses and debt are denominated in U.S. dollars and changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate may have a negative impact on Telesat\u2019s financial results and affect the ability of Telesat to repay or refinance its borrowings. Telesat\u2019s main currency exposures as of December 31, 2015 lie in its U.S. dollar denominated cash and short term investments and debt financing. In addition, approximately 51% of Telesat\u2019s revenues, 42% of its operating expenses and a majority of its capital expenditures for 2015 were denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result of a significant decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar during 2015, Telesat recorded a mainly non-cash foreign exchange loss of approximately $427 million. As of December 31, 2015, a five percent increase (decrease) in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would have increased (decreased) Telesat\u2019s net income by approximately $115.5 million. This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.\nLoral reports its investment in Telesat using the equity method of accounting. Loral reports its investment in Telesat in U.S. dollars while Telesat reports its financial results in Canadian dollars. As a result, Telesat\u2019s results of operations are subject to conversion from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Changes in the U.S. dollar relationship to the Canadian dollar affect how Telesat\u2019s financial results are reported in our consolidated financial statements. During 2015, the exchange rate moved from US$1.00/CAD 1.1621 at December 31, 2014 to US$1.00/CAD 1.3839 at December 31, 2015.\nWhile we own 62.8% of Telesat on an economic basis, we own only 32.7% of its voting stock and therefore do not have the right to elect or appoint a majority of the members of its Board of Directors and our interests and those of the other Telesat shareholders may diverge or conflict.\nWhile we own 62.8% of the economic interests in Telesat, we hold only 32.7% of its voting interests. Although the restrictions on foreign ownership of Canadian satellites have been removed by the government of Canada, we are still subject to our shareholders agreement with the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (\u201cPSP\u201d) and the articles of incorporation of Telesat Holdco, which do not allow us to own more voting stock of Telesat Holdco than we currently own. Also, under our shareholders agreement, the governance and management of Telesat is vested in its 10-member Board of Directors, comprised of three Loral-appointed directors, three PSP-appointed directors and four independent directors, two of whom also own Telesat shares with nominal economic value and 31.06% and 6.82% of the voting interests for Telesat directors, respectively. While we own a greater voting interest in Telesat than any other single stockholder with respect to election of directors and we and PSP, which owns 29.4% of the voting interests for directors and 67.3% of the voting interests for all other matters, together own a majority of Telesat\u2019s voting power, circumstances may occur where our interests and those of PSP diverge or are in conflict. For example, it is likely that any strategic transaction involving our ownership interests in Telesat that we wish to pursue will require the cooperation of PSP, and PSP may not share our objectives or wish to pursue transactions in which we are interested or any transaction at all. In the event that our interests differ from those of PSP, PSP, with the agreement of at least three of the four independent directors, may, subject to veto rights that we have under Telesat\u2019s shareholders agreement, cause Telesat to take actions contrary to our wishes. These veto rights are, however, limited to certain extraordinary actions - for example, the incurrence of more than $100 million of indebtedness or the purchase of assets at a cost in excess of $100 million. Moreover, our right to block these actions under the shareholders agreement falls away if, subject to certain exceptions, either (i) ownership or control, directly or indirectly by Dr. Mark H. Rachesky (President of MHR Fund Management LLC, or MHR, which, through its affiliated funds is our largest stockholder) of our voting stock falls below certain levels other than in certain specified circumstances or (ii) there is a change in the composition of a majority of the members of Loral\u2019s board of directors over a consecutive two-year period without the approval of the incumbent directors.\nWe may face indemnification claims from our sale of SS/L.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, SS/L, to MDA. Under the terms of the purchase agreement related to the SS/L sale, we are obligated to indemnify MDA and its affiliates for (1) certain pre-closing taxes; and (2) Covered Litigation Costs and Covered Litigation Damages (as such terms are defined in the Purchase Agreement) relating to the ViaSat lawsuit, subject to certain sharing formulas and caps. Although the ViaSat lawsuit has been settled and we have been released by MDA, MDA Holdings and SS/L from any further indemnification obligations relating thereto, we remain obligated to indemnify MDA for certain pre-closing taxes. The amounts of indemnification claims relating to certain pre-closing taxes have not yet been determined. Where appropriate, we intend vigorously to contest the underlying tax assessments, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful. We may not be able to settle indemnification claims at or below the value recorded in our financial statements, and indemnification claims under the Purchase Agreement, whether pending now or made in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations.\nWe are jointly and severally liable together with MDA and SS/L for the ViaSat litigation settlement payments, and, if MDA and SS/L were to default on their share of the payments, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund the missed payments.\nIn September 2014, we, SS/L and ViaSat settled the lawsuit brought in February 2012 by ViaSat against us and SS/L and an additional lawsuit brought in September 2013 by ViaSat against SS/L. The terms of the settlement agreement provide, among other things, for payment by Loral and SS/L to ViaSat on a joint and several basis of $100 million, $40 million of which was paid in September 2014 in connection with entering into the settlement agreement, with the remaining $60 million to be paid quarterly from October 15, 2014 through January 15, 2017 with interest. Loral and MDA have agreed that Loral will be responsible for $45 million, and MDA and SS/L will be responsible for $55 million, of the $100 million due ViaSat. Pursuant to our agreement with MDA, as of January 31, 2016, Loral, on the one hand, and MDA and SS/L, on the other hand, is each obligated to make additional payments to ViaSat through January 2017 totaling $11.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, including interest. Although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund our share of the payments due ViaSat, because the payment obligations to ViaSat are on a joint and several basis with MDA and SS/L, if MDA and SS/L were to default on all or part of their payment obligations to ViaSat, Loral would be obligated to pay ViaSat any amounts not paid by MDA and SS/L. In such event, and depending on the extent and timing of the default by MDA and SS/L, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund the payments not made by MDA and SS/L; if so, we would have to raise the shortfall through one or a combination of the following: proceeds from a strategic transaction, a rights offering or other equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance whether or when any strategic transaction may occur, and the future cost of raising funds through the capital markets may be expensive or those markets may be unavailable. Inability to raise the necessary funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoral Space & Communications Inc. is a holding company with no current operations; we are dependent upon, and may not receive, sufficient cash flow from our affiliates or be able to incur sufficient borrowings to meet our financial obligations.\nLoral is a holding company with ownership interests in Telesat and XTAR and, as such, Loral has no independent operations or operating assets and has ongoing cash requirements. We are dependent upon, and may not receive, sufficient cash flow from our affiliates or be able to incur sufficient borrowings to meet our financial obligations.\nThe ability of Telesat and XTAR to make payments or distributions to Loral, whether as dividends or as payments under applicable management and consulting agreements or otherwise, will depend on their operating results, including their ability to satisfy their own cash flow requirements, and obligations including, without limitation, their debt service obligations. Moreover, covenants contained in the debt agreements of Telesat impose limitations on its ability to dividend or distribute funds to Loral. Even if the applicable debt covenants would permit Telesat to pay dividends or make distributions, Loral will not have the ability to cause Telesat to do so. See above \u201cWhile we own 62.8% of Telesat on an economic basis, we own only 32.7% of its voting stock and therefore do not have the right to elect or appoint a majority of the members of its Board of Directors and our interests and those of the other Telesat shareholders may diverge or conflict.\u201d Likewise, any dividends or distributions by XTAR would require the prior consent of our Spanish partner in the joint venture.\nLoral earns a consulting fee of $5.0 million a year from Telesat. Telesat\u2019s loan documents generally permit this consulting fee from Telesat to be paid to Loral in cash except if the senior secured leverage ratio under Telesat\u2019s credit and note agreements is greater than 5.25 to 1.0. When the ratio is greater than 5.25 to 1.0, the consulting fee is paid through the issuance of promissory notes to Loral with an annual interest rate of 7% and a maturity date of October 31, 2018. Whether Telesat meets the financial performance criteria to enable payment is dependent upon, among other things, foreign exchange rates which are constantly fluctuating. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no notes receivable from Telesat related to payment of consulting fees. It is uncertain at this time whether Telesat will be permitted to continue to pay the consulting fee in cash in the future.\nAlthough our equity in Telesat Holdco has substantial value, our shareholders agreement with PSP regarding Telesat limits our ability to pledge our shares in Telesat Holdco as collateral for borrowing. For so long as the shareholders agreement is in place in its current form (see below \u201cThe initial public offering of Telesat Holdco and related governance changes that we have requested may not occur or may proceed in a manner contrary to our requests\u201d), we may not be able to borrow or access the debt markets on a secured basis to fund our financial obligations, and our ability to borrow or access the debt markets on an unsecured basis may be limited or not available at all.\nXTAR has not generated sufficient revenues to meet all of its substantial contractual obligations, and XTAR may be unable to pay these obligations when due, which could ultimately result in a restructuring of XTAR.\nXTAR\u2019s take-up rate in its service has been slower than anticipated, and, in fact, in recent years revenues have been declining. For example, XTAR\u2019s revenues declined by approximately 11% from 2014 to 2015 and 17% from 2013 to 2014. As a result, XTAR has deferred certain payments owed to us, Hisdesat and Telesat, including payments due under an agreement with Hisdesat to lease certain transponders on the Spainsat satellite. These lease obligations were $26 million in 2015 with increases thereafter to a maximum of $28 million per year through the end of the useful life of the satellite, which is estimated to be in 2020. In addition, XTAR has entered into an agreement with Hisdesat whereby the past due balance on the Spainsat transponders of $32.3 million as of December 31, 2008, together with a deferral of $6.7 million in payments due in 2009, became payable to Hisdesat over 12 years through annual payments of $5 million. Approximately $4.8 million of the $5 million payment due during 2015 for the past due balance and $12.9 million of the $25 million payment due during 2015 for the current lease obligation were deferred as of December 31, 2015, with interest on the deferred amounts capitalized. XTAR\u2019s lease and other obligations to Hisdesat, which will aggregate in excess of $150 million over the remaining life of the satellite as of December 31, 2015, are substantial, especially in light of XTAR\u2019s limited revenues to date. XTAR has agreed that most of its excess cash balance would be applied towards making limited payments on these obligations, as well as payments of other amounts owed to us, Hisdesat and Telesat in respect of services provided by them to XTAR. Unless XTAR is able to generate a substantial increase in its revenues, these obligations will continue to accrue and grow, and, absent agreement to further defer all or some these obligations, XTAR may be unable to pay them when due, which ultimately could result in a restructuring of XTAR. As of December 31, 2015, $6.8 million was due to Loral from XTAR.\nThe soundness of financial institutions and counterparties could adversely affect Telesat or us.\nWe and Telesat have exposure to many different financial institutions and counterparties (including those under credit, financing and insurance arrangements), including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance providers and other institutions and industry participants. We and Telesat are exposed to risk, including credit risk resulting from many of the transactions executed in connection with hedging activities, in the event that any lenders or counterparties, including insurance providers, are unable to honor their commitments or otherwise default under an agreement with Telesat or us.\nWe have explored, are exploring and expect in the future to explore various strategic transactions; this process may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations whether or not a transaction is ultimately consummated.\nWe have previously explored, and are exploring, potential strategic transactions involving Telesat. In the future, we expect to continue to pursue strategic alternatives involving Telesat with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. The process of pursuing a strategic transaction will result in transaction costs and may result in the diversion of the attention of operating management of Telesat from business operations, the disclosure of confidential information to competitors or potential customers as part of a due diligence process and an adverse perception of Telesat in the marketplace which could, among other things, adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to win new business. Any of such results could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations whether or not a strategic transaction is consummated. There can be no assurance whether or when any transaction involving Loral or Telesat will occur, and, even if a transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance as to whether or to what degree such a transaction will be successful in maximizing value to our shareholders.\nWe may explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances other than those involving Telesat which require financing which may not be available at all or on favorable terms.\nLoral may, in addition to exploring strategic transactions involving Telesat, from time to time, explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds are likely to be required. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all.\nAs part of our business strategy, we or Telesat may complete acquisitions or dispositions, undertake restructuring efforts or engage in other strategic transactions. These actions could adversely affect our or Telesat\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we or Telesat may engage in discussions with third parties regarding, or enter into agreements relating to, acquisitions, dispositions, restructuring efforts or other strategic transactions in order to manage our or Telesat\u2019s product and technology portfolios or further our strategic objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable acquisition or alliance candidates and complete these transactions, some of which may be large and complex. Any of these activities may result in disruptions to our business and may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits anticipated.\nInstability in financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access additional capital.\nIn past years, the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets reached unprecedented levels. If these conditions reoccur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow money or have access to capital, if needed. Lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money. In addition, if we determine that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, the future cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets may be expensive or those markets may be unavailable. If we were unable to raise funds through debt or equity markets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Telesat information in this report other than the information included in the audited financial statements is based solely on information provided to us by Telesat.\nBecause we do not control Telesat, we do not have the same control and certification processes with respect to the information contained in this report on our satellite services segment that we would have if we controlled Telesat. We are also not involved in managing Telesat\u2019s day-to-day operations. Accordingly, the Telesat information contained in this report other than the information included in the audited financial statements is based solely on information provided to us by Telesat and has not been separately verified by us.\nII. Risk Factors Associated With Satellite Services\nTelesat\u2019s in-orbit satellites may fail to operate as expected due to operational anomalies resulting in lost revenues, increased costs and/or termination of contracts.\nSatellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and therefore are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. The risks include in-orbit equipment failures, malfunctions and other kinds of problems commonly referred to as anomalies. Satellite anomalies include, for example, circuit failures, transponder failures, solar array failures, telemetry transmitter failures, battery cell and other power system failures, satellite control system failures and propulsion system failures. Some of Telesat\u2019s satellites have had malfunctions and other anomalies in the past. Acts of war, terrorism, magnetic, electrostatic or solar storms, space debris, satellite conjunctions or micrometeoroids could also damage Telesat\u2019s satellites.\nDespite working closely with satellite manufacturers to determine the causes of anomalies and mitigate them in new satellites and to provide for intrasatellite redundancies for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, anomalies are likely to be experienced in the future, whether due to the types of anomalies described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components, and intrasatellite redundancy may not be available upon the occurrence of such anomalies. There can be no assurance that, in these cases, it will be possible to restore normal operations. Where service cannot be restored, the failure could cause the satellite to have less capacity available for sale, to suffer performance degradation, or to cease operating prematurely, either in whole or in part.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies or other failure (whether full or partial) of any of Telesat\u2019s satellites could cause Telesat\u2019s revenues, cash flows and backlog to decline materially, could require Telesat to repay prepayments made by customers of the affected satellite and could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s relationships with current customers and its ability to attract new customers for satellite services. A failure could result in a customer terminating its contract for service on the affected satellite. If Telesat is unable to provide alternate capacity to an affected customer, the customer may decide to procure all or a portion of its future satellite services from an alternate supplier or the customer\u2019s business may be so adversely affected by the satellite failure that it may not have the financial ability to procure future satellite services. It may also require Telesat to expedite its planned replacement program, adversely affecting its profitability, increasing its financing needs and limiting the availability of funds for other business purposes. Finally, the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to insure satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all, and may cause insurers to demand additional exclusions in policies they issue.\nThe actual orbital maneuver lives of Telesat\u2019s satellites may be shorter than Telesat anticipates and Telesat may be required to reduce available capacity on its satellites prior to the end of their orbital maneuver lives.\nTelesat anticipates that its satellites will have the end of orbital maneuver life dates described above in Item1-Business. For all but one of Telesat\u2019s satellites, the expected end-of orbital maneuver life date goes beyond the manufacturer\u2019s end-of-service life date. A number of factors will affect the actual commercial service lives of Telesat\u2019s satellites, including:\n\u2022 the amount of propellant used in maintaining the satellite\u2019s orbital location or relocating the satellite to a new orbital location (and, for newly-launched satellites, the amount of propellant used during orbit raising following launch);\n\u2022 the durability and quality of their construction;\n\u2022 the performance of their components;\n\u2022 conditions in space such as solar flares and space debris;\n\u2022 operational considerations, including operational failures and other anomalies; and\n\u2022 changes in technology which may make all or a portion of Telesat\u2019s satellite fleet obsolete.\nTelesat has been forced to remove satellites from service prematurely in the past due to an unexpected reduction in their previously anticipated end-of-orbital maneuver life. It is possible that the actual orbital maneuver lives of one or more of Telesat\u2019s existing satellites may also be shorter than originally anticipated. Further, on some of Telesat\u2019s satellites it is anticipated that the total available payload capacity may need to be reduced prior to the satellite reaching its end-of-orbital maneuver life.\nTelesat periodically reviews the expected orbital maneuver life of each of its satellites using current engineering data. A reduction in the orbital maneuver life of any of Telesat\u2019s satellites could result in a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite, the recognition of an impairment loss and an acceleration of capital expenditures. To the extent Telesat is required to reduce the available payload capacity prior to the end of a satellite\u2019s orbital maneuver life, its revenues from the satellite would be reduced.\nTelesat\u2019s satellite launches may be delayed, it may suffer launch failures or its satellites may fail to reach their planned orbital locations. Any such issue could result in the loss of a satellite or cause significant delays in the deployment of the satellite which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nDelays in launching satellites and in the deployment of satellites are not uncommon and result from construction delays, the unavailability of reliable launch opportunities with suppliers, delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals and launch failures. If satellite construction schedules are not met, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the satellite is ready to be launched. Satellites are also subject to certain risks related to failed launches. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need to construct replacement satellites, which typically takes up to 30 months or longer, and to obtain another launch vehicle. A delay or perceived delay in launching a satellite, or replacing a satellite, may cause Telesat\u2019s current customers to move to another satellite provider if they determine that the delay may cause an interruption in continuous service. In addition, Telesat\u2019s contracts with customers who purchase or reserve satellite capacity may allow the customers to terminate their contracts in the event of a delay. Any such termination would require Telesat to refund any prepayment it may have received, and would result in a reduction in Telesat\u2019s contracted backlog and would delay or prevent Telesat from securing the commercial benefits of the new satellite. Launch vehicles may also underperform, in which case the satellite may be lost or, if it can be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location, will have a shorter useful life. Any launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat\u2019s insurance will not protect it against all satellite-related losses. Further, Telesat may not be able to renew insurance on its existing satellites or obtain insurance on future satellites on acceptable terms or at all, and, for certain of Telesat\u2019s existing satellites, Telesat has elected to forego obtaining insurance.\nTelesat\u2019s current satellite insurance does not protect it against all satellite-related losses that it may experience, and it does not have in-orbit insurance coverage for all of the satellites in its fleet. As of December 31, 2015, the total net book value of Telesat\u2019s six in-orbit satellites for which it does not have insurance is approximately CAD 56 million. Telesat\u2019s insurance does not protect it against business interruption, loss of revenues or delay of revenues. In addition, Telesat does not insure the net book value of performance incentives that may be payable to a satellite\u2019s manufacturer as these are payable only to the extent that the satellite operates in accordance with contracted technical specifications. Telesat\u2019s existing launch and in-orbit insurance policies include, and any future policies that Telesat obtains can be expected to include, specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations. Typically, these insurance policies exclude coverage for damage or losses arising from acts of war, anti-satellite devices, electromagnetic or radio frequency interference and other similar potential risks for which exclusions are customary in the industry at the time the policy is written. In addition, they typically exclude coverage for satellite health-related problems affecting Telesat\u2019s satellites that are known at the time the policy is written or renewed. Any claims under existing policies are subject to settlement with the insurers and may, in some instances, be payable to Telesat\u2019s customers.\nThe price, terms and availability of satellite insurance has fluctuated significantly in recent years. These fluctuations may be affected by recent satellite launch or in-orbit failures and general conditions in the insurance industry. Launch and in-orbit policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To the extent Telesat experiences a launch or in-orbit failure that is not fully insured, or for which insurance proceeds are delayed or disputed, it may not have sufficient resources to replace the affected satellite. In addition, higher premiums on insurance policies increase Telesat\u2019s costs, thereby reducing its profitability. In addition to higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles, shorter coverage periods, higher loss percentages required for constructive total loss claims and additional satellite health-related policy exclusions. There can be no assurance that, upon the expiration of an in-orbit insurance policy, which typically has a term of one year, Telesat will be able to renew the policy on terms acceptable to it.\nSubject to the requirements of Telesat\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing Telesat\u2019s senior notes, Telesat may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage for certain of its existing satellites, or elect not to obtain insurance policies for its future satellites, especially if exclusions make such policies ineffective, the costs of coverage make such insurance impractical or if self-insurance is deemed more cost effective.\nReplacing a satellite upon the end of its service life will require Telesat to make significant expenditures and may require Telesat to obtain shareholder approval.\nTo ensure no disruption in Telesat\u2019s business and to prevent loss of its customers, Telesat will be required to commence construction of a replacement satellite approximately five years prior to the expected end of service life of the satellite then in orbit. Typically, it costs in the range of $250 million to $300 million to construct, launch and insure a satellite. There can be no assurance that Telesat will have sufficient cash, cash flow or be able to obtain third party or shareholder financing to fund such expenditures on favorable terms, if at all, or that Telesat will obtain shareholder approval, where required, to procure replacement satellites. Certain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are nearing their expected end-of-orbital maneuver lives. Should Telesat not have sufficient funds available to replace those satellites or should Telesat not receive approval from its shareholders, where required, to purchase replacement satellites, it could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat is subject to significant and intensifying competition within the satellite industry and from other providers of communications capacity. Telesat\u2019s failure to compete effectively would result in a loss of revenues and a decline in profitability, which would adversely affect Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint services for voice, data and video communications and for high-speed internet access. A trend toward consolidation of major FSS providers has resulted in the creation of global competitors who are substantially larger than Telesat in terms of both the number of satellites they have in orbit as well as in terms of their revenues. Due to their larger sizes, these operators are able to take advantage of greater economies of scale, may be more attractive to customers, may (depending on the specific satellite and orbital location in question) have greater flexibility to restore service to their customers in the event of a partial or total satellite failure and may be able to offer expansion capacity for future requirements. Telesat also competes against regional satellite operators who may enjoy competitive advantages in their local markets. As a result of the availability of export credit agency financing for projects that would not otherwise obtain financing from commercial lenders, new entrants, including governments that have traditionally purchased satellite capacity from established satellite operators, are acquiring their own satellites, which increases the amount of available satellite capacity in the marketplace and decreases the demand for Telesat\u2019s services.\nAs a condition of Telesat\u2019s licenses for certain satellites, it is required by DISED, the governmental department overseeing Canadian investment, innovation and economic development, to invest in research and development related to satellite communication activities. Telesat\u2019s global competitors may not face this additional financial burden.\nTelesat expects a substantial portion of its ongoing business will continue to be in the Canadian domestic market. This market is characterized by increasing competition among satellite providers and rapid technological development. Historically, the Canadian regulatory framework has required the use of Canadian-licensed satellites for the delivery of DTH video programming in Canada. It is possible that this framework could change and allow non-Canadian satellite operators that have adequate service coverage in Canadian territory to compete for future business from Telesat\u2019s DTH customers.\nTelesat\u2019s business is also subject to competition from ground based forms of communications technology. For many point-to-point and other services, the offerings provided by terrestrial companies can be more competitive than the services offered via satellite. A number of companies are increasing their ability to transmit signals on existing terrestrial infrastructures, such as fiber optic cable, DSL (digital subscriber line) and terrestrial wireless transmitters often with funding and other incentives provided by government. The ability of any of these companies to significantly increase their capacity and/or the reach of their network likely would result in a decrease in the demand for Telesat\u2019s services. Increasing availability of capacity from other forms of communications technology can create an excess supply of telecommunications capacity, decreasing the prices Telesat would be able to charge for its services under new service contracts and thereby negatively affecting Telesat\u2019s profitability. New technology could render satellite-based services less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in other ways. Telesat also competes for local regulatory approval in places where more than one provider may want to operate and with other satellite operators for scarce frequency assignments and a limited supply of orbital locations.\nTelesat\u2019s failure to compete effectively could result in a loss of revenues and a decline in profitability, a decrease in the value of its business and a downgrade of its credit rating, which would restrict its access to the capital markets.\nFluctuations in available satellite capacity could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s results.\nThe availability of satellite capacity has fluctuated over time, characterized by periods of undersupply of capacity, followed by periods of substantial new satellite construction which is, in turn, followed by an oversupply of available capacity. Given the number of new satellites launched over the past year and the number of satellites presently under construction, many of which contain high throughput payloads, unless Telesat experiences a corresponding increase in demand, the next several years may be characterized by an oversupply of capacity. To the extent Telesat were to experience another period of oversupply of capacity, it may be forced to decrease the prices it charges for services which would adversely affect its results.\nDevelopments that Telesat expects to support the growth in demand for satellite services, such as continued growth in corporate data and internet traffic, the continued proliferation of HDTV and economic growth in Latin America may fail to materialize or may not occur in the manner or to the extent Telesat anticipates.\nReductions in government spending could reduce demand for Telesat\u2019s services.\nGovernments, in particular the U.S. government, purchase a substantial amount of satellite services from commercial satellite operators, including Telesat. To the extent these governments reduce spending on satellite services, as a result of the need to reduce overall spending during periods of fiscal restraint, to reduce budget deficits or otherwise, demand for Telesat\u2019s services could decrease which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s revenue, the prices it is able to charge for services and its results.\nChanges in technology could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new technologies that can provide increased capacity to end users at lower cost may reduce demand for Telesat\u2019s services. The introduction of first generation HTS, such as ViaSat-1, Jupiter 1 and the recently launched Intelsat 29e, the first of Intelsat\u2019s \u201cEpic\u201d line of HTS, which are able to transmit substantially more content than pre-existing satellites, may decrease demand and/or prices for traditional satellite capacity. Additional HTS are currently under construction, including second generation HTS that purport to be capable of throughput that substantially exceeds the throughput of first generation HTS. While Telesat owns the high throughput Canadian payload on ViaSat-1 and has incorporated high throughput payloads on its Telstar 12 VANTAGE satellite and the Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites currently under construction, the introduction of more, and more capable, HTS by other operators into the markets in which Telesat participates could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nA number of global low-earth-orbit satellite projects have recently been announced which, if implemented successfully, could have significant advantages over geostationary satellite systems, in particular for latency sensitive applications. In addition to new satellite technologies, new projects which could compete with traditional satellite services have recently been announced, including for the provision of telecommunications services using balloons or drones.\nImprovements in existing technologies could adversely impact the demand for satellite services. For example, improvements in signal compression could allow Telesat\u2019s customers to transmit the same amount of data using a reduced amount of capacity.\nTelesat derives a substantial amount of its revenues from only a few of its customers. A loss of, or default by, one or more of these major customers, or a material adverse change in any such customer\u2019s business or financial condition, could materially reduce Telesat\u2019s future revenues and contracted backlog.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Telesat\u2019s top five customers together accounted for approximately 52% of its revenues. At December 31, 2015, Telesat\u2019s top five backlog customers together accounted for approximately 81% of its backlog. If any of Telesat\u2019s major customers chooses to not renew its contract or contracts at the expiration of the existing terms or seeks to negotiate concessions, particularly on price, it could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. Telesat\u2019s customers could experience a downturn in their business or find themselves in financial difficulties, which could result in their ceasing or reducing their use of Telesat\u2019s services (or becoming unable to pay for services they had contracted to buy). In addition, some of Telesat\u2019s customers\u2019 industries are undergoing significant consolidation, and Telesat\u2019s customers may be acquired by each other or other companies, including by Telesat\u2019s competitors. Such acquisitions could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to sell services to such customers and to any end-users whom they serve. Some customers have in the past defaulted, and Telesat\u2019s customers may in the future default, on their obligations to Telesat due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Such defaults could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s revenue, operating margins and cash flows. If Telesat\u2019s contracted revenue backlog is reduced due to the financial difficulties of its customers, Telesat\u2019s revenue, operating margins and cash flows would be further negatively impacted.\nChanges in consumer demand for traditional television services and expansion of terrestrial networks have adversely impacted the growth in subscribers to DTH television services in North America which may adversely impact Telesat\u2019s future revenue.\nA substantial amount of Telesat\u2019s revenue is earned from customers who use Telesat\u2019s services to provide DTH television services to the public in North America. Telesat believes that DTH has certain cost, quality and efficiency advantages over terrestrial delivery systems, including fiber, for the consumption of linear television programming (i.e. traditional television viewing where the consumer receives a broad array of channels from their provider and views programming which is delivered at a scheduled time via a specified channel) either live or at a later time using a recording device such as a personal video recorder or PVR. However, for various reasons, the consumption of traditional linear television programming via DTH has recently been challenged in various regions, including North America.\nIn many regions of the world, including North America, the terrestrial networks with which Telesat competes continue to expand. Terrestrial networks have advantages over traditional DTH services for the delivery of two-way services, such as on demand video services. Moreover, one of Telesat\u2019s largest DTH customers also has a substantial fiber terrestrial broadcast distribution network that it is continuing to expand, which has led to certain of its own DTH customers migrating to its terrestrial network. The migration of DTH customers to terrestrial networks in order to access improved two-way services or for other reasons could decrease the demand for Telesat\u2019s services, adversely impacting its revenue and financial performance.\nThe growth of \u201cover the top\u201d (\u201cOTT\u201d) video distribution (e.g., Netflix) may also have an adverse impact on Telesat\u2019s business. OTT distribution is a two way (i.e. non-linear) platform that provides on demand delivery of broadcasting services to consumers through an internet service provider that may not be involved in the control or distribution of the content itself. The growth of OTT distribution may have a negative impact on the demand for the services of some of Telesat\u2019s large DTH customers which could result in lower demand for its satellite capacity.\nIn Canada, the CRTC has mandated that broadcast distributors, including DTH operators, provide consumers with the option of \u2018\u2018skinny basic\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018pick and pay\u2019\u2019 packages. These packages will allow consumers to choose both the number and the specific channels they wish to receive beyond the entry level service offering as compared to the traditional subscription model which required consumers to sign up and pay for a large basic service and encouraged them to subscribe for up to several hundred channels. If consumers only subscribe to an entry level package or significantly reduce their subscriptions it could reduce the revenue Telesat\u2019s customers receive for their DTH offerings. In turn, Telesat\u2019s customers may choose to reduce the number of channels they deliver to consumers which would reduce the amount of satellite capacity they consume, adversely impacting Telesat\u2019s revenue.\nTelesat operates in a highly regulated industry and government regulations may adversely affect its ability to sell its services, or increase the expense of such services or otherwise limit Telesat\u2019s ability to operate or grow its business.\nAs an operator of a global satellite system, Telesat is regulated by government authorities in Canada, the United States and other countries in which it operates.\nIn Canada, Telesat\u2019s operations are subject to regulation and licensing by DISED pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act (Canada) and by the CRTC, under the Telecommunications Act (Canada). DISED has the authority to issue licenses, establish standards, assign Canadian orbital locations, and plan the allocation and use of the radio frequency spectrum, including the radio frequencies upon which Telesat\u2019s satellites and earth stations depend. The Minister responsible for DISED has broad discretion in exercising this authority to issue licenses, fix and amend conditions of licenses, and to suspend or even revoke them. The CRTC has authority over the allocation (and reallocation) of satellite capacity to particular broadcasting undertakings. Some of Telesat\u2019s service agreements are subject to CRTC approval. Telesat is required to pay different forms of \u2018\u2018universal service\u2019\u2019 charges in Canada and have certain research and development obligations that do not apply to other satellite operators with which it competes. These rates and obligations could change at any time. In 2015, the CRTC conducted a regulatory proceeding to review the pricing of Telesat\u2019s C-band FSS services. The results of that proceeding may have an adverse impact on Telesat\u2019s ability to earn revenue from these services.\nIn the United States, the FCC regulates the provision of satellite services to, from, or within the United States. Certain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are owned and operated through a U.S. subsidiary and are regulated by the FCC. In addition, to facilitate the provision of FSS satellite services in C-, Ku- and Ka-band frequencies in the United States market, foreign licensed operators can apply to have their satellites placed on the FCC\u2019s Permitted Space Station List. Telesat\u2019s Anik Fl, Anik FlR, Anik, Anik and Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 satellites are currently on this list. The export from the United States of satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations, in particular the ITAR which currently includes satellites on the list of items requiring export permits. These ITAR provisions have constrained Telesat\u2019s access to technical information and have had a negative impact on its international consulting revenues. In addition, Telesat and its satellite manufacturers may not be able to obtain and maintain necessary export authorizations which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to procure new United States-manufactured satellites; control its existing satellites; acquire launch services; obtain insurance and pursue its rights under insurance policies; or conduct its satellite-related operations and consulting activities.\nTelesat also operates satellites through licenses granted by, and are subject to regulations in, countries other than Canada and the United States. For example, the Brazilian national telecommunications agency, ANATEL, has authorized Telesat, through its subsidiary, TBCS, to operate Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2, a Ku-band FSS satellite at 63\u00b0 WL pursuant to a Concession Agreement. Telstar 18 operates at the 138\u00b0 EL orbital location under an agreement with APT, which has been granted the right to use the 138\u00b0 EL orbital location by The Kingdom of Tonga.\nIn addition to regulatory requirements governing the use of orbital locations, most countries regulate transmission of signals to and from their territory, and Telesat is required to obtain and maintain authorizations to carry on business in the countries in which Telesat operates.\nIf Telesat fails to obtain or maintain particular authorizations on acceptable terms, such failure could delay or prevent Telesat from offering some or all of its services and adversely affect its results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. In particular, Telesat may not be able to obtain all of the required regulatory authorizations for the construction, launch and operation of any of its future satellites, for the orbital locations and spectrum for these satellites and for its ground infrastructure, on acceptable terms or at all. Even if Telesat were able to obtain the necessary authorizations and orbital locations, the licenses Telesat obtains may impose significant operational restrictions, or not protect Telesat from interference that could affect the use of its satellites. Countries or their regulatory authorities may adopt new laws, policies or regulations, or change their interpretation of existing laws, policies or regulations, that could cause Telesat\u2019s existing authorizations to be changed or cancelled, require Telesat to incur additional costs, impose or change existing pricing, or otherwise adversely affect its operations or revenues. As a result, any currently held regulatory authorizations are subject to rescission and renewal and may not remain sufficient or additional authorizations may be necessary that Telesat may not be able to obtain on a timely basis or on terms that are not unduly costly or burdensome. Further, because the regulatory schemes vary by country, Telesat may be subject to regulations in foreign countries of which Telesat is not presently aware that it is not in compliance with, and as a result could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government.\nTelesat\u2019s operations may be limited or precluded by ITU rules or processes, and Telesat is required to coordinate its operations with those of other satellite operators.\nThe ITU, a specialized United Nations agency, regulates the global allocation of radio frequency spectrum and the registration of radio frequency assignments and any associated orbital location in the geostationary satellite orbit. Telesat participates in the activities of the ITU. Only national administrations, however, have full standing as ITU members. Consequently, Telesat must rely on the relevant government administrations to represent its interests.\nThe ITU establishes the Radio Regulations, an international treaty which contains the rules concerning frequency allocations and the priority to, coordination of, and use of, radio frequency assignments. The ITU Radio Regulations define the allocation of radio frequencies to specific uses. The ITU Radio Regulations are periodically reviewed and revised at World Radiocommunication Conferences, which take place typically every three to four years. As a result, Telesat cannot guarantee that the ITU will not change its allocation decisions and rules in the future in a way that could limit or preclude Telesat\u2019s use of some or all of its existing or future orbital locations or spectrum.\nThe ITU Radio Regulations also establish operating procedures for satellite networks and prescribe detailed coordination, notification and recording procedures. With respect to the frequencies used by commercial satellites, the ITU Radio Regulations set forth a process for protecting earlier-registered satellite systems from interference from later-registered satellite systems. In order to comply with these rules, Telesat must coordinate the operation of its satellites, including any replacement satellite that has performance characteristics that are different from those of the satellite it replaces, with other satellites. This process requires potentially lengthy and costly negotiations with parties who operate or intend to operate satellites that could affect or be affected by Telesat\u2019s satellites. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, the Russian Satellite Communications Company (\u201cRSCC\u201d) launched a satellite to operate at 14\u00b0 WL, adjacent to Telesat\u2019s Telstar 12 at 15\u00b0 WL. Pursuant to its coordination agreement with RSCC, Telesat was required to cease using certain frequencies on its Telstar 12 satellite as soon as RSCC\u2019s new satellite commenced service, which required Telesat to relocate some of its customers to alternate frequencies and reduced the available capacity on the satellite from which Telesat is able to earn revenue. The coordination agreement with RSCC also limited the frequencies Telesat was able to incorporate into its Telstar 12 VANTAGE satellite that was launched and entered service in the fourth quarter of 2015, which may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to attract customers for Telstar 12 VANTAGE.\nIn certain countries, a failure to resolve coordination issues is used by regulators as a justification to limit or condition market access by foreign satellite operators. In addition, while the ITU Radio Regulations require later-in-time systems to coordinate their operations with Telesat, Telesat cannot guarantee that other operators will conduct their operations so as to avoid transmitting any signals that would cause harmful interference to the signals that Telesat, or its customers, transmit. This interference could require Telesat to take steps, or pay or refund amounts to its customers, that could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. The ITU\u2019s Radio Regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement regulations and neither the ITU specifically, nor international law generally, provides clear remedies if the ITU coordination process fails. Failure to coordinate Telesat\u2019s satellites\u2019 frequencies successfully or to obtain or maintain other required regulatory approvals could have an adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s business operations, prospects and financial condition, as well as on the value of its business.\nIf Telesat does not make use of its orbital spectrum rights by specified deadlines, or does not continue to use the orbital spectrum rights it currently uses, those rights may become available for other satellite operators to use.\nTelesat\u2019s in-orbit satellites do not currently occupy all of the geostationary orbital (\u201cGSO\u201d) locations for which it has obtained regulatory authorizations. In some cases, the Telesat satellite that occupies an orbital location is not designed to use all of the frequency spectrum for which Telesat has been authorized. Similarly, Telesat has been granted regulatory authorizations for certain spectrum in non-geostationary orbits (\u201cNGSO\u201d) that are not yet occupied.\nIn accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations, governments have rights to use certain GSO locations and NGSO orbits and the associated radio frequencies. Certain of these governments have in turn authorized Telesat to use GSO locations, NGSO orbits and associated radio frequencies in addition to those used by its current satellites. Under the ITU Radio Regulations, Telesat must bring into use these orbital locations, orbits and frequency assignments within a fixed period of time, or the governments in question would lose their international priority rights and the GSO location or NGSO orbits, and associated frequencies likely would become available for use by another satellite operator.\nIn addition to ITU requirements, the governments that have authorized Telesat to use these orbital resources have generally conditioned such use on Telesat meeting certain milestones, including making use of the orbital spectrum by a specified time.\nIf Telesat is unable to place satellites into currently unused GSO locations or NGSO orbits in a manner that satisfies the ITU Radio Regulations and national regulatory requirements, or if the ITU or national regulatory requirements were to change, or if Telesat is unable to maintain satellites or make use of all of the spectrum for which it has been authorized at the GSO locations that it currently uses, Telesat may lose its rights to use these orbital resources and they would become available for other satellite operators to use. The loss of one or more of Telesat\u2019s orbital resources could negatively affect its plans and its ability to implement its business strategy.\nTelesat\u2019s business is capital intensive, and Telesat may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance its business strategies, or Telesat may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict its ability to operate its business.\nImplementation of Telesat\u2019s business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. As Telesat pursues its business strategies and seeks to respond to developments in its business and opportunities and trends in its industry, its actual capital expenditures may differ from its expected capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that Telesat will be able to satisfy its capital requirements in the future. In addition, if one of Telesat\u2019s satellites failed unexpectedly, there can be no assurance of insurance recovery or the timing thereof and Telesat may need to exhaust or significantly draw upon its revolving credit facility or obtain additional financing to replace the satellite. If Telesat determines that it needs to obtain additional funds through external financing and is unable to do so, Telesat may be prevented from fully implementing its business strategy.\nThe availability and cost to Telesat of external financing depends on a number of factors, including its credit rating and financial performance and general market conditions. Telesat\u2019s ability to obtain financing generally may be influenced by the supply and demand characteristics of the telecommunications sector in general and of the satellite services sector in particular. Declines in Telesat\u2019s expected future revenues under contracts with customers and challenging business conditions faced by its customers are among the other factors that may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s credit and access to the capital markets. Other factors that could impact Telesat\u2019s credit rating include the amount of debt in its current or future capital structure, activities associated with strategic initiatives, the health of its satellites, the success or failure of its planned launches, its expected future cash flows and the capital expenditures required to execute its business strategy. The overall impact on Telesat\u2019s financial condition of any transaction that it pursues may be negative or may be negatively perceived by the financial markets and rating agencies and may result in adverse rating agency actions with respect to its credit rating and access to the capital markets. Long-term disruptions in the capital or credit markets as a result of uncertainty or recession, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s access to capital. A credit rating downgrade or deterioration in Telesat\u2019s financial performance or general market conditions could limit its ability to obtain financing or could result in any such financing being available only at greater cost or on more restrictive terms than might otherwise be available and, in either case, could result in Telesat deferring or reducing capital expenditures including on new or replacement satellites. In certain circumstances, Telesat is required to obtain the approval of its shareholders to incur additional indebtedness. There can be no assurances that Telesat will receive such approval, if required.\nMarket conditions may make it difficult for Telesat to extend the maturity of or refinance its existing indebtedness, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Telesat had outstanding senior secured credit facilities consisting of: a CAD 375 million term loan A maturing in March 2017; a CAD 136 million term loan B maturing in March 2019; and a $1.698 billion term loan B maturing in March 2019. Together with Telesat\u2019s CAD 140 million revolving credit facility, the U.S. term loan B is subject to a springing maturity which will occur on February 13, 2017, if Telesat\u2019s senior notes are not refinanced by that date. Telesat will need to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness on or before maturity. Disruptions in the financial markets have occurred in the past and are likely to reoccur in the future, which could make it more difficult to renew or extend the facilities at current commitment levels, on similar terms or at all. A reduced commitment from the lenders, increased borrowing costs or modification to the financial covenant would result in an increase in Telesat\u2019s financing costs and/or a decrease in its liquidity, which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s growth, its financial condition, its results of operations and its ability to make debt payments, including repayments on the senior notes when they become due.\nTelesat may experience a failure of ground operations infrastructure or interference with its satellite signals that impairs the commercial performance of, or the services delivered over, its satellites or the satellites of other operators for whom it provides ground services, which could result in a material loss of revenues.\nTelesat operates an extensive ground infrastructure including a satellite control center in Ottawa, its main earth station and back up satellite control facility at Allan Park, nine earth stations throughout Canada, one teleport located in the United States and one in Brazil and its telemetry, tracking and control (\u201cTT&C\u201d) facility in Perth, Australia. These ground facilities are used for controlling Telesat\u2019s satellites and for the provision of end-to-end services to Telesat\u2019s customers.\nTelesat may experience a partial or total loss of one or more of these facilities due to natural disasters (tornado, flood, hurricane or other such acts of God), fire, acts of war or terrorism or other catastrophic events. A failure at any of these facilities would cause a significant loss of service for Telesat customers. Additionally, Telesat may experience a failure in the necessary equipment at the satellite control center, at the back-up facility, or in the communication links between these facilities and remote earth station facilities. A failure or operator error affecting tracking, telemetry and control operations might lead to a breakdown in the ability to communicate with one or more satellites or cause the transmission of incorrect instructions to the affected satellite(s), which could lead to a temporary or permanent degradation in satellite performance or to the loss of one or more satellites. Intentional or non-intentional electromagnetic or radio frequency interference could result in a failure of Telesat\u2019s ability to deliver satellite services to its customers. A failure at any of Telesat\u2019s facilities or in the communications links between its facilities or interference with its satellite signal could cause its revenues and backlog to decline materially and could adversely affect its ability to market its services and generate future revenues and profit.\nTelesat purchases equipment from third party suppliers and depends on those suppliers to deliver, maintain and support these products to the contracted specifications in order for Telesat to meet its service commitments to its customers. Telesat may experience difficulty if these suppliers do not meet their obligations to deliver and support this equipment. Telesat may also experience difficulty or failure when implementing, operating and maintaining this equipment or when providing services using this equipment. This difficulty or failure may lead to delays in implementing services, service interruptions or degradations in service, which could cause Telesat\u2019s revenues and backlog to decline materially and could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to market its services and generate future revenues and profit.\nTelesat\u2019s dependence on outside contractors could result in delays related to the design, manufacture and launch of its new satellites, which could in turn adversely affect Telesat\u2019s operating results and prospects.\nAny delays in the design, construction or launch of Telesat\u2019s satellites could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. There are a limited number of manufacturers that are able to design and build satellites according to the technical specifications and standards of quality Telesat requires, including Airbus Defense and Space, Thales Alenia Space, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, MELCO, Orbital and SS/L. There are also a limited number of suppliers able to launch such satellites, including International Launch Services, Arianespace, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (\u201cSpaceX\u201d) and Lockheed Martin. Should any of Telesat\u2019s suppliers\u2019 businesses fail, it would reduce competition and could increase the cost of satellites and launch services. Adverse events with respect to any of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers or launch suppliers could also result in the delay of the design, construction or launch of its satellites. For example, many of Telesat\u2019s past launches were provided by International Launch Services, an entity owned by the Russian government. In response to the ongoing situation involving the Russian Federation in the Ukraine, various governments have implemented economic and other sanctions against Russia and its interests. U.S. law requires satellite manufacturers to obtain a license from the U.S. government for the export of certain prescribed U.S. technologies, if the export of the technology is to a Russian counterparty. Virtually all satellites manufactured outside of China contain prescribed U.S. technology. Should the U.S. implement sanctions having the effect of blocking the export of satellites containing prescribed U.S. technologies to Russian-controlled launch providers, it would lead to a reduction in launch alternatives and, as a result, could lead to increased launch costs in the future, which could have an adverse impact on Telesat\u2019s business.\nGeneral economic conditions may also affect the ability of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers and launch suppliers to provide services on commercially reasonable terms or to fulfill their obligations in terms of manufacturing schedules, launch dates, pricing or other items. Even where alternate suppliers for such services are available, Telesat may have difficulty identifying them in a timely manner, or may incur significant additional expense in changing suppliers, and this could result in difficulties or delays in the design, construction or launch of Telesat\u2019s satellites.\nA natural disaster could diminish Telesat\u2019s ability to provide communications service.\nNatural disasters could damage or destroy Telesat\u2019s ground stations resulting in a disruption of service to its customers. Telesat has in place certain operational procedures designed to protect its antennas and ground stations during natural disasters such as a hurricane, but these procedures may not be sufficient and the collateral effects of such disasters such as flooding may impair the functioning of its ground equipment and its ability to control its satellites. If a future natural disaster impairs or destroys any of Telesat\u2019s ground facilities, Telesat may be unable to provide service to its customers in the affected area for a period of time.\nTelesat\u2019s future reported net income could be adversely affected by impairments of the value of certain intangible assets.\nThe assets on Telesat\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 include goodwill valued at approximately CAD 2.4 billion and other intangible assets valued at approximately CAD 315 million. A valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets (such as orbital locations) with indefinite useful lives is undertaken on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount is likely to exceed their recoverable amount. Telesat measures for impairment using a projected discounted cash flow method and confirms the assessment using other valuation methods. If the asset\u2019s carrying value is more than its recoverable amount, the difference is recorded as a reduction in the amount of the asset on the balance sheet and an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. Testing for impairment requires significant judgment by management to determine the assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Any changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the impairment analysis and result in an impairment charge. Telesat cannot predict whether an event that triggers impairment will occur, when it will occur or how it will affect the reported asset values. If Telesat\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets are deemed to be impaired in whole or in part, it could be required to reduce or write off such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nThe content of third-party transmissions over Telesat\u2019s satellites may affect Telesat since Telesat could be subject to sanctions by various governmental entities for the transmission of certain content.\nTelesat provides satellite capacity for transmissions by third parties. Telesat does not decide what content is transmitted over its satellites, although its contracts generally provide it with rights to prohibit certain types of content or to cease transmission or permit Telesat to require its customers to cease their transmissions under certain circumstances. A governmental body or other entity may object to some of the content carried over Telesat\u2019s satellites, such as \u2018\u2018adult services\u2019\u2019 video channels or content deemed political in nature. Issues arising from the content of transmissions by these third parties over Telesat\u2019s satellites could affect its future revenues, operations or relationship with certain governments or customers.\nTelesat\u2019s failure to maintain or obtain authorizations under and comply with the U.S. export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe export of satellites and technical data related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services are subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws, implemented by U.S. State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations. If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the export control laws and regulations of the United States, it may be unable to export technical data or equipment to non-U.S. persons and companies, including to Telesat\u2019s own non-U.S. employees, as required to fulfill existing contracts. If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under and comply with the trade sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, it may not be able to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to certain of its customers. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in civil and criminal sanctions or penalties. Telesat\u2019s ability to acquire new satellites, launch new satellites or operate its satellites could also be negatively affected if its suppliers do not obtain required U.S. export authorizations.\nTelesat is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.\nTelesat\u2019s operations internationally are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business globally. Telesat is subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While Telesat\u2019s employees and contractors are required to comply with these laws, Telesat cannot be sure that its internal policies and procedures will always protect it from violations of these laws, despite Telesat\u2019s commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s business, performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nIII. Other Risks\nWe have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a strategic transaction with respect to our interest in Telesat Holdco; there can be no assurance, however, as to when or whether we will be able to conclude any such transaction.\nOur principal asset is our majority ownership interest in Telesat Holdco. In an effort to maximize shareholder value, we have been exploring potential strategic transactions to alter the status quo in our ownership of Telesat Holdco, including monetizing our interest through the sale of Loral or through the combination of Loral and Telesat into one public company. The initiative to monetize our interest in Telesat Holdco through the sale of Loral terminated in early 2015, and PSP has informed us that it does not wish to proceed with a combination transaction. In 2015, we exercised our rights under the Telesat Holdco Shareholders Agreement (the \u201cShareholders Agreement\u201d) to require Telesat Holdco to conduct an initial public offering of the equity shares of Telesat Holdco. See \u201cThe initial public offering of Telesat Holdco and related governance changes that we have requested may not occur or may proceed in a manner contrary to our requests\u201d below. In addition, we have been and are continuing to explore a cash distribution to Telesat Holdco shareholders (and, in turn, a cash distribution to our stockholders), either in conjunction with a strategic transaction or Telesat initial public offering or on a stand-alone basis. While we remain interested in and plan to continue to pursue a strategic transaction, there can be no assurance as to when or whether we will be able to conclude any such transaction or that any strategic initiatives or transaction or cash distribution involving Telesat, Telesat Holdco or Loral may occur, or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to any initiative, transaction or distribution involving Telesat, Telesat Holdco or Loral\u2019s interest therein will be achieved.\nThe initial public offering of Telesat Holdco and related governance changes that we have requested may not occur or may proceed in a manner contrary to our requests.\nOur Shareholders Agreement with PSP regarding Telesat provides for either PSP or Loral to initiate the process of conducting an initial public offering of the equity shares of Telesat Holdco (a \u201cTelesat IPO\u201d). In connection with our exploration of strategic initiatives to alter the status quo in our ownership of Telesat Holdco, in July 2015, we exercised our rights under the Shareholders Agreement to require Telesat Holdco to conduct a Telesat IPO. Specifically, we requested that Telesat Holdco issue not more than 25 million newly issued shares of Telesat Holdco voting common stock. We also requested the termination of the Shareholders Agreement and the elimination of certain provisions in Telesat Holdco\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, both of which we believe are necessary to accommodate a successful public offering. If those provisions are eliminated, an impediment to the conversion of our non-voting Telesat Holdco shares to voting shares would be eliminated. Termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement and conversion of our non-voting shares to voting shares would enable us, after the Telesat IPO and subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, to obtain majority voting control of Telesat Holdco. Telesat Holdco has selected two co-managing underwriters and has informed us that it is working to implement the Telesat IPO. In addition, we are in discussions with PSP to attempt to agree on our requests regarding the Shareholders Agreement and Telesat Holdco\u2019s Articles of Incorporation. If we are unable to reach agreement with PSP on these matters, the advice of the lead underwriters selected for the Telesat IPO will be sought to assist resolution. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms the Telesat IPO, termination or modification of the Shareholders Agreement or any requested changes to Telesat Holdco\u2019s Articles of Incorporation may occur. If the Telesat IPO proceeds under unfavorable terms or at an unfavorable price, we may withdraw our demand for the Telesat IPO or otherwise seek to enforce our rights. There can be no assurance that the Telesat IPO will occur, or that any particular economic, tax, structural or other objectives or benefits with respect to the Telesat IPO will be achieved.\nA public offering of stock in Telesat Holdco could adversely affect the market for, and price of, our common stock and the value of our interest in Telesat.\nIf the Telesat IPO that we have requested occurs, it is uncertain whether the offering would include a primary offering of shares by Telesat Holdco, a secondary offering of shares by either or both of the Telesat shareholders or a combination of both types of offerings. It is also uncertain what effect the Telesat IPO (and any corporate restructuring required in connection with such offering under the terms of the Telesat shareholders agreement) would have on Loral\u2019s governance rights in Telesat. Changes in our Telesat governance rights could adversely affect the value of our interest in Telesat and the price at which our common stock trades. In addition, a public market for Telesat equity would create a situation where there would be two separate public-market proxies for the value of Telesat - our stock and the Telesat stock. Telesat stock would represent a direct interest in Telesat, whereas the value of the common shares of Loral would also include other assets and liabilities, many of which are difficult to value. Having both Telesat stock and our stock trading publicly could create confusion in the market and could adversely affect the liquidity and/or trading values of either our or Telesat\u2019s common stock.\nThird parties have significant rights with respect to our affiliates.\nThird parties have significant rights with respect to, and we do not have control over management of, our affiliates. For example, while we own 62.8% of the participating shares of Telesat, we own only 32.7% of the voting power. Also, Hisdesat enjoys substantial approval rights in regard to XTAR, our X-band joint venture. The rights of these third parties and fiduciary duties under applicable law could result in others acting or failing to act in ways that are not in our best interest. For example, it is likely that any strategic transaction involving Telesat or XTAR that we wish to pursue will require the cooperation of our joint venture partners, and our partners may not share our objectives or wish to pursue a transaction in which we are interested or any transaction at all.\nThe loss of executive officers and our inability to retain other key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to pursue strategic alternatives.\nLoral and Telesat rely on a number of key employees, including members of management and certain other employees possessing unique experience in technical and commercial aspects of the satellite services business. If Loral or Telesat are unable to retain these employees, it could be difficult to replace them. In addition, the business of Telesat, with its constant technological developments, must continue to attract highly qualified and technically skilled employees. In the future, the inability to retain or replace these employees, or the inability to attract new highly qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, business prospects and financial condition of Loral or Telesat.\nAlso, we have retained Michael B. Targoff, our former chief executive officer and president, as a consultant, in particular to provide assistance and guidance in the oversight of strategic matters relating to Telesat and XTAR. The consulting agreement may be terminated by either the Company or Mr. Targoff at any time for any reason or for no reason on ten days prior notice. There can be no assurance that Mr. Targoff will not terminate the agreement, and, were he to do so, the ability of the Company to pursue strategic alternatives with regard to Telesat and XTAR could be adversely affected.\nInterruption or failure of, or cyber-attacks on, Telesat\u2019s or our information technology and communications systems could hurt Telesat\u2019s or our ability to operate our respective businesses effectively, which could harm Telesat\u2019s or our business and operating results.\nTelesat\u2019s and our ability to operate our respective businesses depends, in part, on the continuing operation of Telesat\u2019s and our information technology and communications systems, which are an integral part of Telesat\u2019s and our businesses. We and Telesat rely on our information and communication systems, as well as software applications developed internally and externally to, among other things, effectively manage the accounting and financial functions, including maintaining internal controls, operate Telesat\u2019s satellites and satellites for third parties, provide consulting services by Telesat to customers and transmit customer proprietary and/or confidential content and data. Although we and Telesat take steps to secure information and communications systems, including computer systems, intranet and internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks, the security measures implemented have not always been effective. While we and Telesat continue to bolster systems with additional security measures, and, working with external experts, mitigate the risk of security breaches, systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss, telecommunications or equipment failures, transportation interruptions, accidents or other disruptive events or attempts to harm our or Telesat\u2019s systems. In addition, Telesat\u2019s and our facilities are also potentially vulnerable to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Moreover, some of these systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Telesat\u2019s and our business and operations could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, operations are disrupted or shut down, confidential or proprietary information is stolen or disclosed, costs are incurred or fines are required in connection with confidential or export-controlled information that is disclosed, significant resources are dedicated to system repairs or to increase cyber security protection or we or Telesat otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of any such event. While Telesat\u2019s or our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of these types of events, to the extent any such losses are not covered by insurance, a serious disruption to systems could significantly limit Telesat\u2019s or our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMHR may be viewed as our controlling stockholder and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, various funds affiliated with MHR and Dr. Rachesky held approximately 38.0% of the outstanding voting common stock of Loral as well as all issued and outstanding shares of Loral non-voting common stock, which, when taken together, represent approximately 57.1% of the outstanding common equity of Loral as of December 31, 2015. As of February 16, 2016, representatives of MHR occupy two of the seven seats on our board of directors. One seat on our board, previously occupied by a former managing principal of MHR, is currently vacant. In addition, one of our other directors was selected by the creditors\u2019 committee in our predecessor\u2019s chapter 11 cases, in which MHR served as the chairman. Conflicts of interests may arise in the future between us and MHR. For example, MHR and its affiliated funds are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Under our agreement with PSP, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that either (i) ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by Dr. Rachesky, of our voting stock falls below certain levels other than in certain specific circumstances or (ii) there is a change in the composition of a majority of the members of the Loral board of directors over a consecutive two-year period without the approval of the incumbent directors, we will lose our veto rights relating to certain actions by Telesat. In addition, after either of these events, PSP will have certain rights to enable it to exit from its investment in Telesat, including a right to cause Telesat to conduct an initial public offering in which PSP\u2019s shares would be the first shares offered or, if no such offering has occurred within one year due to a lack of cooperation from Loral or Telesat, to cause the sale of Telesat and to drag along the other shareholders in such sale, subject to our right to call PSP\u2019s shares at fair market value.\nThere is a thin trading market for our voting common stock.\nTrading activity in our voting common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ National Market, has generally been light, averaging approximately 55,000 shares per day for the year ended December 31, 2015. Moreover, over 50% of our voting common stock is effectively held by MHR and several other stockholders. If any of our significant stockholders should sell some or all of their holdings, it will likely have an adverse effect on our share price. Although the funds affiliated with MHR have restrictions on their ability to sell our shares under U.S. securities laws, we have filed a shelf registration statement in respect of the voting common stock and non-voting common stock they hold in Loral that effectively eliminates such restrictions. Such funds also have other demand and piggyback registration rights in respect of their Loral voting common stock and non-voting common stock that would also, if exercised, effectively eliminate such restrictions.\nThe market for our voting common stock could be adversely affected by future issuance of significant amounts of our voting common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 21,427,078 shares of our voting common stock and 9,505,673 shares of our non-voting common stock were outstanding. On that date, there were also outstanding 75,262 vested restricted stock units. These restricted stock units may be settled either in cash or Loral voting common stock at the Company\u2019s option. As of December 31, 2015, 1,315,618 shares of our voting common stock were available for future grants under our stock incentive plan. We may further amend our stock incentive plan in the future to provide for additional increases in the number of shares available for grant thereunder.\nSales of significant amounts of our voting common stock to the public, or the perception that those sales could happen, could adversely affect the market for, and the trading price of, our voting common stock. For example, if, MDA and SS/L were to default on their share of the ViaSat litigation settlement payments, we will be obligated to fund the shortfall and may have to do so by raising proceeds through a rights offering or other equity financing (see \u201cWe are jointly and severally liable together with MDA and SS/L for the ViaSat litigation settlement payments, and, if MDA and SS/L were to default on their share of the payments, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund the missed payments\u201d above).\nChanges in tax rates or policies or changes to our tax liabilities could affect operating results.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxation on our worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the United States. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate our tax liabilities, and our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the applicable tax laws, composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or our valuation and utilization of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, and there can be no assurance that any final determination by a taxing authority will not result in additional tax liability which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe future use of tax attributes is limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had various tax attributes including federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $252.2 million, state NOLs, primarily California ($77.8 million) and New York ($1.1 million), and federal and state tax credits, that are available to offset future tax liability (see Notes 2 and 7 to the Loral consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting treatment of such tax attributes). As our reorganization on November 21, 2005 constituted an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use these tax attributes existing at such effective date, is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $32.6 million, subject to increase or decrease based on certain factors. If Loral experiences an additional \u201cownership change\u201d during any three-year period after November 21, 2005, future use of these tax attributes may become further limited. An ownership change may be triggered by sales or acquisitions of Loral equity interests in excess of 50% by shareholders owning five percent or more of our total equity value, i.e., the total market value of our equity interests, as determined on any applicable testing date. We would be adversely affected by an additional \u201cownership change\u201d if, at the time of such change, the total market value of our equity multiplied by the federal applicable long-term tax exempt rate, which at December 31, 2015 was 2.61%, was less than $32.6 million. As of December 31, 2015, the total market value of our equity ($1.3 billion) multiplied by the federal applicable long-term tax exempt rate was approximately $32.9 million.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, our intermediaries or companies in which we have an interest, such as Telesat and XTAR, fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nAccounting standards periodically change and the application of our accounting policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nThe regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards, including, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The effect of such revised or new standards on our consolidated financial statements can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our management must exercise judgment in appropriately applying many of our accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, the accounting policy or method chosen might be reasonable under the circumstances and yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported if we had selected a different policy or method. Accounting policies are critical to fairly presenting our results of operations and financial condition and may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.", "PERMNO": 91024, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "LORL"}
