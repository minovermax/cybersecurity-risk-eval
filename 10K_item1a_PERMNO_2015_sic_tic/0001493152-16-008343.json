{"cik": "868278", "company": "ProPhase Labs, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These risks could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to significant competitive pressures\nThe OTC healthcare product, pharmaceutical, dietary supplement and consumer product industries are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, distribution and experience than we do. Our competitors may have certain advantages, including the ability to allocate greater resources for new product development, marketing and other purposes.\n- 7 -\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support, and new and existing product innovation and commercialization. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. If we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings may be significantly negatively impacted.\nCough-cold category and product innovation\nOur flagship Cold-EEZE\u00ae cold remedy brand is an established brand within the cough-cold category. However, some retailers are reallocating shelf space away from the cough-cold category to other product categories. With cough-cold shelf space at a premium, opportunities in the future to introduce new Cold-EEZE\u00ae branded products in the cough-cold category may be limited. Therefore, to continue to grow our Company, we are in the process of implementing a series of new product development and pre-commercialization initiatives in the dietary supplement category. While management anticipates the growth potential in this product category may be better, the risks associated with introducing new products that do not leverage the Cold-EEZE\u00ae brand name may be significant. Therefore, no assurance can be made that our new product efforts will be successful.\nNew product development; our long range business plan may not be successful\nWe face significant technological risks inherent in developing new products. We may be subject to delays and/or ultimately unable to successfully implement our business plan and strategy to develop and commercialize one or more non-prescription remedies and/or dietary supplements. The commercialization and ultimate product market acceptance is subject to, among other influences, consumer purchasing trends, demand for our product, health and wellness trends, regulatory factors, retail acceptance and overall economic and market conditions. As a consequence, we may suspend or abandon some or all of our proposed new products before they become commercially viable. Even if we develop and obtain approval of a new product, if we cannot successfully commercialize it in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have aligned our operations to focus principally in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of OTC health care and cold remedy consumer products, natural based health products and more recently, dietary supplement products. In addition, we may seek to acquire from third parties or enter into other arrangements with respect to new formulations, ingredients, applications and other products developed by third parties who may be seeking our commercialization, marketing and distribution expertise.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate our business plan successfully or that our revenue will grow. In addition, we may not be successful in acquiring or otherwise entering into any new lines of business, including dietary supplement products, and, if we are successful in doing so, there can be no assurance that such new business will achieve profitability.\nWe will need to obtain additional capital to support long term product development and commercialization programs\nOur ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability depends in large part on our ability to commence, execute and complete new and existing product innovation and commercialization and, if required, clinical programs to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and elsewhere. We can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve such product innovation and commercialization, to obtain any required approvals or to achieve significant levels of sales.\nThe amount of capital that may be needed to complete product development initiatives will depend on many factors which may include but are not limited to (i) the cost involved in applying for and obtaining FDA, international regulatory or other technical approvals, (ii) whether we elect to establish partnering arrangements for development, sales, manufacturing and marketing of such products, (iii) the level of future sales of OTC health care, cold remedy or dietary supplement products, and expense levels for marketing efforts, (iv) whether we can establish and maintain strategic arrangements for development, sales, manufacturing and marketing of our products, and (v) whether any or all of the options for our common stock, $0.0005 par value, (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d) issued to employees of the Company are exercised and the timing and amount of these exercises.\n- 8 -\nShould research or commercialization activity progress on certain formulations, resulting expenditures may require substantial financial support. The current sales level of our OTC health care and cold remedy products may not generate all the funds we anticipate will be needed to support future product acquisition or development. Accordingly, in addition to funding from operations, we may in the short and long term seek to raise capital through the issuance of securities or to secure other financing sources to support our research, new product technologies, applications, licensing, commercialization and other development opportunities. If we obtain such funding through the issuance of equity securities, it would result in the dilution of current stockholders\u2019 ownership in the Company. Any debt financing, if available, may include financial and other covenants that could restrict use of proceeds of such financing or impose other business and financial restrictions on us. In addition, we may consider alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture, or partnership arrangements to provide long term capital. There can be no assurances that we will have access to the capital required to fun these aspects of our business on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to access our Equity Line of Credit under commercially reasonable terms\nOn July 30, 2015 we executed a new equity line of credit agreement (such arrangement, the \u201c2015 Equity Line\u201d) with Dutchess Opportunity Fund II LP (\u201cDutchess\u201d) whereby, Dutchess committed to purchase, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, up to 3,200,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, over a period of 36 months expiring August 2018.\nIn Fiscal 2015, we sold an aggregate of 438,480 shares of Common Stock to Dutchess under a previous 2014 equity line of credit with Dutchess in which we derived net proceeds of $524,000. In addition, we sold an aggregate of 750,000 shares of Common Stock to Dutchess under the 2015 Equity Line in which we derived net proceeds of $1.0 million. At March 25, 2016, we have 2,450,000 shares of our Common Stock available for sale, at our discretion, under the terms of the 2015 Equity Line and covered pursuant to a registration statement.\nPursuant to the 2015 Equity Line, Dutchess is committed to purchase, subject to certain conditions, the remaining 2,450,000 shares of our Common Stock from time to time through August 2018. Dutchess will not be obligated to purchase shares under the 2015 Equity Line unless certain conditions are met, which include, among others: effectiveness of the registration statement; the continued listing of our stock on either the NASDAQ Global Market (our current listing), NASDAQ Capital Market or OTC Bulletin Board; our compliance with our obligations under the purchase agreement and registration rights agreement entered into with Dutchess; the absence of injunctions or other governmental actions prohibiting the issuance of our Common Stock to Dutchess; the absence of violations of shareholder approval requirements with respect to such issuance of our Common Stock to Dutchess and the accuracy of representations and warranties made to Dutchess. If we are unable to access funds through the 2015 Equity Line, we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all.\nTo the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to access our 2015 Equity Line to finance our growth. Our 2015 Equity Line is limited and may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. If we need to seek other sources of capital, uncertainty in the credit markets and the potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through our 2015 Equity Line on terms that we believe to be reasonable, or at all.\nAny draw downs under our 2015 Equity Line with Dutchess may result in dilution to our shareholders\nIf we sell shares to Dutchess under the 2015 Equity Line, it will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current shareholders, and may result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. If we draw down amounts under the 2015 Equity Line, we will issue shares to Dutchess at a discount of 5% from the average price of our Common Stock. If we draw down amounts under the 2015 Equity Line when our share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher. Issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing, and may further decrease our share price.\n- 9 -\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service payments\nOn December 11, 2015, we executed two Subscription Agreements (the \u201cSubscription Agreements\u201d) with the investors named therein (the \u201cInvestors\u201d) providing for the purchase of 12% Secured Promissory Notes - Series A (\u201cNotes\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $3.0 million and warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock ( the \u201cWarrants\u201d ). The Warrants grant the Investors the right to purchase 17,000 shares of common stock for every $500,000 of principal amount of Notes purchased by the Investors.\nNotes in the amount of $1,500,000 and 51,000 Warrants, at an exercise price of $1.35 per share, were issued by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Pharmaloz Manufacturing Inc. and Quigley Pharma Inc. (collectively, the \u201cObligors\u201d) and funded on December 11, 2015. The Notes are secured by all of our tangible and intangible assets. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum, payable semi-annually and the principal is due and payable on June 15, 2017. The Notes may be pre-paid at any time prior to maturity without penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total secured Notes outstanding of $1.5 million, excluding $34,000 in unamortized interest for loan origination costs and the fair value of the Warrants. We may incur additional debt to finance future research and development, and product launch and related marketing activities.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt service payments depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our business may generate insufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, and currently anticipated cost savings, capital investment plans, working capital reductions and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule, or at all. To the extent our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, aside from our current liquidity, we would be dependent on outside capital to meet the funding of our debt service obligations and to fund capital expenditures and other obligations.\nIf we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or issue additional equity securities. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or issue equity securities on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and result in the acceleration of our debt obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nIn recent years, there has been substantial volatility in financial markets due at least in part to the global economic environment. In addition, there has been substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing is uncertain. Moreover, customer spending habits may be adversely affected by the current economic environment and prevailing high under employment rates in the United States. These conditions could have an adverse effect on our industry and business, including our access to funding sources, demand for our products and our customers\u2019 ability to continue to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to issue equity or to incur indebtedness to finance our growth. Turmoil and volatility in the credit markets and the potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings, under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms that we believe to be reasonable, or at all.\nCommodity price increases will increase our operating costs and may negatively affect financial results\nCommodity prices impact our business directly through the cost of raw materials used to make our products (such as corn syrup, sucrose and other commodities and ingredients) and the amount we pay to purchase packaging for our products (such as paper, board and plastic). Commodities such as these are susceptible to price volatility caused by conditions outside of our control, including fluctuations in commodities markets, currency fluctuations, availability of supply, weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Increases in the price of our commodities and other raw materials would negatively impact our gross margins and/or our sales volume if we were unable to offset such increases through increases in our selling price, changes in product mix or cost reduction/productivity enhancement efforts.\n- 10 -\nThe sales of our primary product fluctuates by season and from Cold Season to Cold Season\nOur sales are derived principally from our OTC health care and cold remedy products. A significant portion of our business is highly seasonal, which causes major variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. The first and fourth quarters generally represent the largest sales volume for our OTC health care and cold remedy products. In addition, our sales are influenced by and subject to fluctuations in the timing of purchase and the ultimate level of demand for our products which are a function of the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Generally, a Cold Season is defined as the period of September to March when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our working capital needs and inventory to meet the fluctuating demand for these products. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand may result in the production of excess inventory which may be expensive to store or which we may be required to dispose if such excess inventory remains unsold. Conversely, if products achieve greater success than anticipated for any given quarter, this may result in insufficient inventory to meet customer demand. If we do not manage our working capital needs and inventory, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur performance may fluctuate when our retail customers are affected simultaneously by the same economic, regulatory or health and wellness factors\nOur revenues are significantly concentrated in our OTC health care and cold remedy products. Our retail customers are subject to fluctuations of business based upon consumer purchasing trends, demand for cold remedy products and overall economic and market conditions. Consequently, many retailers will likely be influenced at the same time by similar economic conditions, regulatory factors or health and wellness trends, which can affect the level of demand for our products. It is reasonable to expect that, if one retailer reduces or delays its purchasing in response to a general economic, regulatory or health and wellness factor, other retailers may also decide to reduce or delay their purchasing at approximately the same time. Accordingly, our sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of such factors.\nWe have a concentration of sales to and accounts receivable from several large retail customers\nAlthough we have a broad range of retail customers that includes many national chain, regional, specialty and local retail stores, our five largest customers accounted for a significant percentage of our sales, approximately 48% and 58% of total revenues for Fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, retail customers comprising the five largest accounts receivable balances represented 60% and 67% of total accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We extend credit to retail customers based upon an evaluation of their financial condition and credit history, and collateral is not generally required. If one or more of these large retail customers cannot pay, the write-off of their accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The loss of sales to any one or more of these large retail customers would also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRetail customer\u2019s strategic business plans may negatively influence the distribution of our products to consumer\nChanges in our retail and distribution customers strategic business plans including, but not limited to, (i) expansions, mergers, and/or consolidations, (ii) retail shelf space allocations for products within each outlet and in particular the cough/cold category in which we compete, (iii) changes in their private label assortment and (iv) product selections, distribution allocation, merchandising programs, commercial terms and retail pricing of our products as well as competitive products could affect the consumer sales of our products and result in a material adverse effect to our business and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on the continued sales of our principal product\nFor Fiscal 2015 and 2014, our health care and cold remedy products, principally Cold-EEZE\u00ae, represented approximately 90% and 95%, respectively, of our total sales. Accordingly, we depend on the continued acceptance of Cold-EEZE\u00ae products by our customers. Our investments in and strategies used for our brand marketing are critical to achieve brand awareness with current consumers, educate potential new consumers and convert potential consumers into customers. However, there can be no assurance that Cold-EEZE\u00ae products will continue to receive, maintain or increase market acceptance. The inability to successfully commercialize Cold-EEZE\u00ae products in the future and/or expand the product line, for any reason, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, prospects and ability to continue operations.\n- 11 -\nOur products and potential new products are or may be subject to extensive governmental regulation\nOur business is regulated by various agencies of the states and localities where our products are sold. Governmental regulations in foreign countries where we plan to commence or expand sales may prevent or delay entry into a market or prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation of certain of our products. In addition, no prediction can be made as to whether new domestic or foreign legislation regulating our activities will be enacted. Any new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. Non-compliance with any applicable requirements may subject us or the manufacturers of our products to agency action, including warning letters, fines, product recalls, seizures and injunctions.\nThe manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our health care and cold remedy products are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including (i) the FDA, (ii) the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), (iii) the Consumer Product Safety Commission, (iv) the United States Department of Agriculture, (v) the United States Postal Service, (vi) the United States Environmental Protection Agency and (vii) the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nIn addition to OTC and prescription drug products, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals and herbs, food additives, food supplements, over-the-counter and prescription drugs and cosmetics. The FTC also has overlapping jurisdiction with the FDA to regulate the promotion and advertising of vitamins, over-the-counter drugs, cosmetics and foods. In addition, our cold remedy products are homeopathic remedies which are subject to standards established by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (\u201cHPUS\u201d). HPUS sets the standards for source, composition and preparation of homeopathic remedies which are officially recognized under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, as amended.\nPreclinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of potential new products are also subject to federal and state regulation in the United States and other countries. Clinical trials and product marketing and manufacturing are subject to the rigorous review and approval processes of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. To obtain approval of a new drug product, a company must demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug product is safe and effective for its intended use. Obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive. Typically, obtaining regulatory approval for pharmaceutical products requires substantial resources and takes several years. The length of this process depends on the type, complexity and novelty of the product and the nature of the disease or other indication to be treated. Preclinical studies must comply with FDA regulations. Clinical trials must also comply with FDA regulations to ensure safety of the human subjects in the trial and may require large numbers of test subjects, complex protocols and possibly lengthy follow-up periods. Consequently, satisfaction of government regulations may take several years: may cause delays in introducing potential new products for considerable periods of time and may require imposing costly procedures upon our activities. If regulatory approval of new products is not obtained in a timely manner or not at all, we could be materially adversely affected. Even if regulatory approval of new products is obtained, such approval may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations.\nWe have a history of losses and limited working capital\nWe have experienced net losses for each of the four of the past five fiscal years. There can be no assurance that our strategic focus will result in any revenue growth or that we will be successful in initiating or acquiring any new lines of business, or that any such new lines of business will achieve profitability. As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of approximately $7.3 million which we believe is an acceptable and adequate level of working capital to support our business for at least the next twelve months ending March 31, 2017. Our ability to fund working capital and debt service needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\n- 12 -\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continued service of key personnel, such as Mr. Ted Karkus, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert V. Cuddihy, Jr., Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and certain managers and strategists within the Company. If we are unable to attract and retain such personnel, the loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn order to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, marketing and health product positions. In particular, our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified health and science professionals. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services that we require is intense and hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills required is time-consuming and expensive. If we are not be able to hire sufficient professional staff to support our operations, or to train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we do hire, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.\nWe are dependent on our manufacturing facility and suppliers for certain of our cold remedy products\nOur manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center is located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. In the event of a disruption of this facility, we would need to outsource to third parties, at least temporarily, our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution requirements. While such secondary sources have been identified for our products, if we are unable to find other sources or there were a delay in the ramp-up for the production and distribution operations for some of our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nCertain raw material active ingredients used in connection with the Cold-EEZE\u00ae products are purchased from a single unaffiliated supplier. Should the relationship terminate or the vendor become unable to supply material, we believe that current contingency plans would prevent such termination from materially affecting our operations, although there may be delays in production of our products until an acceptable replacement supplier is located.\nOur inability to find alternative sources for some of our manufacturing and raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition, the terms on which manufacturers and suppliers will make products and raw materials available to us could have a material effect on our success.\nThe manufacturing of OTC products and dietary supplements is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations and FDA inspections. We believe we are in substantial compliance with material provisions of the applicable cGMP regulations. Contract manufacturers are also subject to these same requirements and we require such compliance in our contractual relationships with such manufacturers. However, we cannot assure that the FDA will agree with our determination of compliance. If the FDA disagrees, it could, upon inspection of our facility, issue a notice of violations, referred to as a form FDA-483, or issue a Warning Letter, or both. If the FDA concludes that there is an imminent public health threat or if we fail to take timely corrective actions to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency can initiate legal actions, such as seizure and injunction, which could include a recall order or the entry of a consent decree, or both. In addition, we could be subject to monetary penalties and even criminal prosecution for egregious conduct. The FDA could initiate similar legal actions against the contract manufacturer if it concludes its facility is not in compliance, which would affect the availability of our products. While secondary sources have been identified for our products, our inability to find other sources or a delay in the ramp-up for the production and distribution operations for some of its products may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n- 13 -\nWe are uncertain as to whether we can protect our proprietary rights\nThe strength of our patent position and proprietary formulations and compounds may be important to our long-term success. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents in connection with potential products; however there can be no assurance that these patents and proprietary formulations and compounds will effectively protect our products from duplication by others. In addition, we may not be able to afford the expense of any litigation which may be necessary to enforce our rights under any of the patents. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not obtain access to or independently develop our technologies, know-how, ideas, concepts and documentation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that current and future products do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, if any of our current or future products do infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others, we may have to modify the products or obtain an additional license for the manufacture and/or sale of such products. We could also be prohibited from selling the infringing products. If we were found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, it is uncertain whether we would be able to take corrective actions in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and operations.\nOur existing products and potential new products expose us to potential product liability claims\nOur business results in exposure to an inherent risk of potential product liability claims, including claims for serious bodily injury or death caused by the sales of our existing products and the products which are being developed. These claims could lead to substantial damage awards. While we currently maintain product liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us in excess of, or outside of, existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, may also have a material adverse effect on the consumer demand for our products.\nWe are involved in litigation matters\nWe are, from time-to-time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, can be time-consuming and expensive to defend and can divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. During the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall.\nOur compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley may require that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\n- 14 -\nOur stock price is volatile\nThe market price of our Common Stock has experienced significant volatility. From January 1, 2015 to March 25, 2016, the closing price of our stock has ranged from $1.16 to $1.71 per share. There are several factors which could affect the price of our Common Stock, including announcements of technological innovations for new commercial products by us or our competitors, developments concerning propriety rights, new or revised governmental regulation or general conditions in the market for our products. Sales of a substantial number of shares by existing stockholders could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of the Common Stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur, could affect prevailing trading prices of our Common Stock. As of March 25, 2016, we had 17,080,776 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nAs of March 25, 2016, there are outstanding options, which are fully vested, to purchase an aggregate of 1,709,250 shares of our Common Stock at an average exercise price of $1.21 per share. If these options are exercised, and the holders of these options were to attempt to sell a substantial amount of their holdings at once, the market price of our Common Stock would likely decline. Moreover, the perceived risk of this potential dilution could cause stockholders to attempt to sell their shares and investors to \u201cshort\u201d our stock, a practice in which an investor sells shares that he or she does not own at prevailing market prices, hoping to purchase shares later at a lower price to cover the sale. As each of these events would cause the number of shares of Common Stock being offered for sale to increase, our Common Stock\u2019s market price would likely further decline. All of these events could combine to make it very difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market, which would adversely affect the price and liquidity of our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. If our Common Stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our Common Stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our Common Stock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets, and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our Common Stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Delisting from The NASDAQ Global Market could also result in other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, the unpredictability of our financial results likely reduces the certainty, and therefore reliability, of the forecasts by securities or industry analysts of our future financial results, adding to the potential volatility of our stock price.\nOur officers and directors own a substantial amount of our Common Stock\nAs of March 25, 2016, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 30.0% of our Common Stock. These individuals have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. Consequently, they exercise substantial influence over all major decisions including major corporate actions such as mergers and other business combinations transactions which could result in or prevent a change of control of the Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our officers and directors could be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders. Accordingly, a shareholder\u2019s ability to influence us through voting their shares may be limited or the market price of our Common Stock may be adversely affected.\n- 15 -\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock since our inception. Our intention is to retain earnings, if any, for use in the business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions that may be barriers to a takeover\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions which may deter, discourage, or make it difficult for another person or entity to gain control of the Company through a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or similar transaction or series of transactions. These provisions may deter a future tender offer or other takeover attempt which could include a premium over the market price of our Common Stock at the time. Such provisions could depress the trading price of our Common Stock\nWe have agreed to indemnify our Officers and Directors from liability\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any person who is or was made a party to, or is or was threatened to be made a party to, any pending, completed, or threatened action, suit or proceeding because he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the Company\u2019s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. These provisions permit us to advance expenses to an indemnified party in connection with defending any such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnified party to repay those amounts if it is later determined that the party is not entitled to indemnification. We entered into indemnity agreements with each member of our board of directors and Mr. Cuddihy. These agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify each officer and director in the event they become a party or otherwise a participant in any action or proceeding on account of their service as a director or officer of the Company (or service for another corporation or entity in any capacity at the request of the Company) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. These indemnity provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and discourage or deter stockholders from suing directors or officers for breaches of their duties to the Company, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company or its stockholders. In addition, to the extent that we expend funds to indemnify directors and officers, funds will be unavailable for operational purposes.", "PERMNO": 85205, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRPH"}
