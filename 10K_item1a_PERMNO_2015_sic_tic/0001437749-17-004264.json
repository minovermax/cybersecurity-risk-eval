{"cik": "713095", "company": "FARMERS CAPITAL BANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or laws could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect the Company\u2019s powers, authority, and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Further, in the performance of their supervisory duties and enforcement powers, the Company\u2019s banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy practices they deem as unsafe or unsound or violations of law. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations, which may be material to its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company in the future may become subject to additional supervisory actions and/or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on its business, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of its common stock.\nUnder federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, the KDFI (for state-chartered banks), the Federal Reserve (for bank holding companies), and the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on the Company\u2019s part if they determine that the Company has insufficient capital or is otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, bank regulators can require the Company to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.\nIf the Company is unable to comply with the terms of future regulatory orders to which it may become subject, then it could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If the Company\u2019s regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. If the Company\u2019s bank is unable to comply with regulatory requirements, it could ultimately face failure. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and take significant management time to resolve.\nNonperforming assets are made up of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned, and other foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, performing restructured loans, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income in several ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting interest income. When the Company repossesses collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to record the property at its fair value less estimated selling costs, which typically decreases net income. The Company\u2019s level of nonperforming assets have improved considerably in the last few years, but remain elevated at 2.4% of total assets at year-end 2016. However, 57% of nonperforming assets consist of performing restructured loans.\nNonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital the Company\u2019s regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. While the Company seeks to reduce its problem loans through workouts, restructurings, and otherwise, decreases in the value of these assets, the underlying collateral, or our borrowers\u2019 performance or financial conditions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management of our bank, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future. If economic conditions do not improve or worsen in our markets, the Company could continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming assets.\nLosses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance established for that purpose, which will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nVolatility and deterioration in the broader economy increase the Company\u2019s risk of credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. If a significant number of loans in the Company\u2019s portfolio are not repaid, it would have an adverse effect on its earnings and overall financial condition. The Company\u2019s bank subsidiary maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses reflects management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in their loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. This evaluation is primarily based upon a review of the bank\u2019s historical loan loss experience, known risks contained in the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, composition and growth of the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, and other economic and qualitative factors. Additionally, the bank\u2019s regulators may require additional provision for the loan portfolio in connection with their examinations, agreements, or orders. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. As a result, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to cover actual losses in its loan portfolio. Consequently, the Company risks having additional future provision for loan losses that may materially affect its earnings.\nIf the Company\u2019s local markets experience a prolonged recession or economic downturn, it may be required to make further increases in its allowance for loan losses and to charge off additional loans, which would adversely affect its results of operations and capital.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s loans are to businesses and individuals located in Kentucky. A downturn or prolonged decline in the Central and Northern Kentucky economies could negatively impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the ability of customers to repay their loans, collateral values securing loans, and the stability of funding sources. This could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, approximately 66% of the Company\u2019s investments in municipal bonds are issued by political subdivisions or agencies located in Kentucky.\nGenerally, the Company\u2019s nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers. Deterioration in real estate and other financial markets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial performance. If trends in the housing and real estate markets worsen, the Company could experience an increase in delinquencies and credit losses. As a result, the Company may be required to increase its provision for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. If additional provisions and charge-offs cause the Company to experience losses, it may be required to contribute additional capital to the bank to maintain capital ratios required by regulators.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is increased by its real estate development lending.\nReal estate development lending has historically been considered to be higher credit risk than that of other types of lending, such as for single-family residential properties. At year-end 2016, $6.4 million or 5% of the outstanding balance of our real estate development loans was classified as impaired. Real estate development loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers. These loans can be affected by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy in general because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development and, in most cases, sale of the underlying property. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortized over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity of the loan. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically depends on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. In the current economic environment, although improving, the ability of borrowers to refinance or sell newly developed property or vacant land remains challenging. If the real estate markets were to worsen or not improve, the Company likely will experience increased credit losses and require additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This \u201cdisintermediation\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, and it may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\nMaintaining or increasing the Company\u2019s market share may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and services.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce net interest margin and revenues from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require the Company to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company might not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nThe Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio is comparatively larger than other community banks and it is more dependent on its investment portfolio to generate net income.\nThe Company relies more heavily on its investment securities portfolio as a source of interest income than many other community banks because its loan portfolio makes up a smaller proportion of its earning assets. If the Company is not able to successfully manage the interest rate spread on the investment portfolio, its net interest income will decrease, which would adversely affect its results of operations and negatively impact net income. Investment securities tend to have a lower risk than loans, and as such, generally provide a lower yield. For 2016, average investment securities made up 32.3% of the Company\u2019s average total assets. Interest income on investment securities accounted for 19.2% of total interest income for 2016.\nThe Company periodically sells investment securities at irregular intervals in the normal course of business to execute its current asset/liability management strategies. This will result in the realization of either a net gain or loss. Moreover, proceeds from sales may be reinvested in investment securities with lower yields, which could reduce future earnings from investment securities. The Company monitors its investment securities portfolio for deteriorating values and for other-than-temporary impairment. Uncertainty surrounding the credit risk associated with mortgage collateral or guarantors may cause material discrepancies in valuation estimates obtained from third parties. Volatile market conditions may reduce the valuations of investment securities due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks in addition to interest rate risk. There can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in material impairments of these assets, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could lead to additional losses.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liability when it takes title to properties.\nIn the course of its business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, it could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. Additionally, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination stemming from the property. If the Company becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of merging its subsidiary banks and data processing company into one bank.\nOn February 20, 2017, the Company merged its four subsidiary banks and data processing subsidiary into one bank. While the Company anticipates lower operating costs as a result of the merger, the actual savings may differ materially from expectations. The merger could result in, among other things, disruptions to the Company\u2019s business, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, or loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition and offset any savings resulting from the merger.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economy on its future results of operations or the market price of its stock.\nThe slow, uneven growth of the economy continues to present challenges and uncertainty for the national economy and the financial services sector in particular. The Company cannot accurately predict the timing, severity, or duration of an economic slowdown, which can adversely impact its performance and the markets it serves. Any deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in the Company\u2019s local markets would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could also cause the market price of the Company\u2019s stock to decline. While it is impossible to predict how long these conditions may exist, the economic uncertainty could continue to present risks for some time for our industry and the Company.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly harm the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, the policies of its regulators, and the prevailing interest rates in the United States and the Company\u2019s markets. In addition, it is increasingly common for the Company\u2019s competitors, who may be aggressively seeking to attract deposits as a result of liquidity concerns arising from changing economic or other conditions, to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates. A significant component of the Company\u2019s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets, such as loans, and the expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits. A change in market interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it collects on loans and investments; or, alternatively, if interest rates earned on earning assets decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities. Consequently, as with most financial institutions, the Company is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in market interest rates may also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and mortgage-back investment securities resulting in the receipt of funds that may be reinvested at a lower rate.\nThe FDIC periodically amends its deposit insurance rate assessment structure, which can increase costs to the Company.\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC must establish and implement a plan to restore the deposit insurance fund\u2019s designated reserve ratio to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020. The FDIC must continue to assess and consider the appropriate level of the reserve ratio annually by considering each of the following: risk of loss to the insurance fund; economic conditions affecting the banking industry; the prevention of sharp swings in the assessment rates; and any other factors the FDIC deems important. The FDIC\u2019s current fund management strategy includes a targeted long-term reserve ratio of 2.0%.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required changes to a number of components of the FDIC insurance assessment. While these changes have resulted in a lower amount of deposit insurance assessments for the Company, future changes in assessment rates or methodology could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future earnings and liquidity in a material amount.\nA decrease to the corporate federal income tax rate may impair the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d).\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s DTAs were approximately $15.2 million. While a decline in the corporate tax rate may lower the Company\u2019s tax provision expense, it may also significantly reduce the value of the Company\u2019s DTAs in the year the rate decrease is enacted. Such reduction could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nTransactions between the Company and its captive insurance subsidiary (the \u201cCaptive\u201d) may be subject to certain IRS responsibilities and penalties.\nThe Company\u2019s Captive is a Kentucky-based, wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of the Company that provides property and casualty insurance coverage to its subsidiaries for risk management purposes or where insurance may not be available or economically feasible. The Treasury Department of the United States and the IRS by way of Notice 2016-66 have stated that transactions believed similar in nature to transactions between the Captive and the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries may have the potential for tax avoidance or evasion and may be deemed by the IRS as an abusive tax structure subject to significant penalties, interest and possible criminal prosecution.\nAny future losses may require the Company to raise additional capital; however, such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain certain levels of capital to support its operations. While the Company\u2019s current capital levels materially exceed regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if ever needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time and on the Company\u2019s future financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot make assurances with respect to its ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. The Company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital.\nThe tightening of available liquidity could limit the Company\u2019s ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand, which could adversely affect its earnings and capital levels.\nLiquidity is crucial to the Company\u2019s business. While the Company\u2019s liquidity materially exceeds regulatory requirements, a tightening of the credit and liquidity markets and the Company\u2019s inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits may negatively affect its earnings and capital levels. In addition to deposit growth, maturity of investment securities, and loan payments from borrowers, the Company relies from time to time on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits. In the event of a downturn in the economy, these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to the Company. The Company\u2019s liquidity position could be significantly constrained if it were unable to access funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank or other wholesale funding sources.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook may be adversely affected by damage to its reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook is highly dependent upon perceptions of its business practices and reputation. Its ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged. Negative public opinion could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including regulatory actions taken against the Company, lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers of its subsidiaries, or sharing or inadequate protection of customer information. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could give rise to loss of customers and legal risks, which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nThe Company conducts most of its operations in Central and Northern Kentucky. The banking and financial services businesses in these areas are highly competitive and increased competition in its primary market areas may adversely impact the level of its loans and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitors include national banks, regional banks, and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial intermediaries. The Company\u2019s competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers, and the range of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to increase its loans and level of deposits.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult to resell the stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe Company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future. The market value of its common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, most of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets;\n\u25cf\nchanges in global financial markets, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility, and other geopolitical events;\n\u25cf\nconditions in our local and national credit, mortgage, and housing markets;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments with respect to financial institutions generally, including government regulation;\n\u25cf\nour dividend practice;\n\u25cf\nactual and anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and earnings;\n\u25cf\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nnews reporting relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; and\n\u25cf\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s common stock may also be impacted by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in: (1) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, the Company\u2019s common stock and (2) sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the Company\u2019s operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the Company\u2019s equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional common or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the Company of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors is authorized generally to cause it to issue additional common and preferred stock without any action on the part of the Company\u2019s shareholders, except as may be required under the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, the board has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences, and other terms. This could include preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if the Company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nYou may not receive dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as, and if its board of directors declares them and as permitted by its regulators. Although we have recently declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividends in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiary bank and certain regulatory considerations.\nThe Parent Company is a financial holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary bank. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its bank subsidiary.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of many other similar companies.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market. As of December 31, 2016, the 50-day average trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock on NASDAQ was 40,606 shares or .54% of the total common shares outstanding of 7,509,444. An efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of a stock at any given time. The Company has no control over such individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, larger sales volumes of its common stock could cause the value of its common stock to decrease. Moreover, due to its lower trading volume, it may take longer to liquidate your position in the Company\u2019s common stock without detrimentally affecting the price.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock constitutes equity and is subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness, and is effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non-common equity claims against its subsidiaries.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock represent equity interests in the Company and do not constitute indebtedness. Accordingly, the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock rank junior to all of its indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on Farmers Capital Bank Corporation with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims.\nThe Company\u2019s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability of the Company\u2019s common stockholders to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. As a result, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries, including claims of bank depositors.\nMarket volatility could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity position, and access to additional capital.\nThe capital and credit markets experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during much of the most recent economic downturn, with unprecedented levels of volatility and other disruptions. In many cases, this led to downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If similar market disruptions and volatility recur, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital.\nRisks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of our limited market area.\nCommercial banks and other financial institutions, including the Company, are affected by economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by governmental monetary policies. These conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely affect profitability. In addition, almost all of the Company\u2019s primary business area is located in Central and Northern Kentucky. Significant downturns in this economic region may result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit quality, reduce demand for credit, and may harm the financial stability of the Company\u2019s customers. Due to the Company\u2019s regional market area, these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on the Company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger, more diverse market area.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.\nLending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u25cf\nunanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow;\n\u25cf\nchanges in economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe duration of the loan; and\n\u25cf\nin the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral.\nDue to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans, such loans present a greater risk to the Company than other types of loans when non-payment by a borrower occurs.\nConsumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.\nInability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management, and staff could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and net income.\nThe Company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue-generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThe Company\u2019s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, the Company faces significant operational risks.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.\nA failure in or breach, including cyber attacks, of the Company\u2019s operational or security systems, or those of its third party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase its costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against it or its customers and that may result in financial losses to the Company or its customers, privacy breaches against its customers, or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. Such fraudulent activity may be in various forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest acts. In recent periods, there has been a rise in electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, the Company has also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its computer systems and networks. Although the Company takes protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its and its customers\u2019 information, and modifies these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, the Company\u2019s computer systems, software and networks and those of its customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by the Company and its customers. Despite the defensive measures the Company takes to manage its internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties, such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within the Company. Given the increasingly high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and remedied.\nThe Company also faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate its business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, the Company\u2019s operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with its customers grows, the Company increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to its customers\u2019 electronic systems.\nAlthough to date the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. The Company\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of the Company\u2019s business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Company maintains an insurance policy which it believes provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of its size and scope with similar technological systems. However, the Company cannot assure that this policy will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, or penalties, including lost revenues, should it experience any one or more of its or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing an attack.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors.\nThe Company utilizes certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. The Company is exposed to the risk that such vendors fail to perform under these arrangements. This could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s policies and procedures designed to monitor and mitigate vendor risks will be effective in preventing or limiting the effect of vendor non-performance.\nSignificant legal actions could subject the Company to substantial uninsured liabilities.\nFrom time to time the Company is subject to claims related to its operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant costs to defend. To protect the Company from the cost of these claims, it maintains insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that are believed to be appropriate for its operations. However, the insurance coverage may not cover all claims against the Company or continue to be available at a reasonable cost. As a result, the Company may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nCustomers or others may make claims and take legal action against the Company related to fiduciary responsibilities. If claims and legal action against the Company are not resolved in a favorable manner to the Company, it could result in a material financial liability or damage to our reputation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has increased the Company\u2019s costs of operations which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity\nThe goals of the Dodd-Frank Act include restoring public confidence in the financial system, preventing another financial crisis, and allowing regulators to identify failings in the system before another crisis can occur. As part of the reform, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which has broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act also changes the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators, imposes additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements in areas such as executive compensation and proxy access, and limits or prohibits proprietary trading, hedge fund, and private equity activities of banks. It also impacts areas such as deposit insurance, mortgage lending, capital requirements, securitizations, and insurance.\nThe scope of the Dodd-Frank Act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry and requires the development and adoption of numerous implementing regulations, some of which have yet to be finalized. Consequently, the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry and the Company will depend, in large part, upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them and the approaches taken to implement the regulations. The Company continually assesses the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on its business and operations and believes that compliance with these new laws and regulations has resulted in higher costs, but the probable impact cannot be measured with a high degree of certainty. Compliance with the new laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, any of which may impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 10913, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFKT"}
