{"cik": "1065059", "company": "CENTRUS ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect our financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us.\nWar in Ukraine\nThe current war in Ukraine has led to the U.S., Russia and other countries imposing sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade. The situation is rapidly changing, and it is not possible to predict future actions that could be taken. The Company has multiple sources of supply; however, the supply contract with Tenex remains our largest source. At present, sanctions have not impacted the ability of the Company or TENEX to perform under the TENEX supply contract. Recently sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. on exports of fossil fuels. Russia has imposed sanctions on the export of commodities but does not include the export of LEU. Additional sanctions or other measures by the U.S. or foreign governments (including the Russian government) could be imposed. Any sanctions or measures directed at trade in LEU from Russia or the parties involved in such trade or otherwise could interfere with, or prevent, implementation of the TENEX Supply Contract. While the initial sanctions announced do not affect the ability of the Company or TENEX to implement the TENEX Supply Contract, the situation at this time is unpredictable and therefore there is no assurance that future developments would not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s procurement, payment, delivery or sale of LEU under the TENEX Supply Contract.\nIf measures were taken to limit the supply of Russian LEU or to prohibit or limit dealings with Russian entities, including, but not limited to, TENEX or ROSATOM, the Company would seek a license, waiver or other approval from the government imposing such measures to ensure that the Company could continue to fulfill its purchase and sales obligations. There is no assurance that such a license, waiver, or approval would be granted. If a license, waiver or approval were not granted, the Company would need to look to alternative sources of LEU to replace the LEU that it could not procure from TENEX. The Company has contracts for alternative sources that could be used to mitigate a portion of the near term impacts. However, to the extent these sources were insufficient or more expensive or additional supply cannot be obtained, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and competitive position.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nOur future prospects are tied directly to the nuclear energy industry worldwide, and the financial difficulties experienced by, and operating conditions of, our customers and suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nPotential events that could affect either our customers or suppliers under current or future contracts with us or the nuclear industry as a whole, include:\n\u2022pandemics, armed conflicts (including the war in Ukraine), government actions and other events that disrupt supply chains, production, transportation, payments and importation of nuclear materials or other critical supplies or services;\n\u2022natural or other disasters (such as the 2011 Fukushima disaster) impacting nuclear facilities or involving shipments of nuclear materials;\n\u2022changes in U.S. or foreign government policies and priorities;\n\u2022regulatory actions or changes in regulations by nuclear regulatory bodies applicable to us, our suppliers or our customers;\n\u2022decisions by agencies, courts or other bodies under applicable trade and other laws applicable to us, our suppliers or our customers;\n\u2022disruptions in other areas of the nuclear fuel cycle, such as uranium supplies or conversion;\n\u2022civic opposition to, or changes in government policies regarding, nuclear operations;\n\u2022business decisions concerning reactors or reactor operations;\n\u2022the financial condition of reactor owners and operations;\n\u2022the need for generating capacity; or\n\u2022consolidation within the electric power industry.\nThese events could adversely affect us to the extent they result in a reduction or elimination of customers\u2019 contractual requirements to purchase from us; the suspension or reduction of nuclear reactor operations; the reduction or blocking of supplies of raw materials, natural or enriched uranium or separative work units (SWU), lower demand, burdensome regulation, disruptions of shipments, production importation or payment (including the blocking or restriction of transportation services or hardware); increased competition from third parties; and increased costs or difficulties or increased liability for actual or threatened property damage or personal injury. Additionally, customers may face financial difficulties, including from factors unrelated to the nuclear industry, that could affect their willingness or ability to make purchases. We cannot provide any assurance that events will not preclude us from making deliveries to our customers, increase our costs or that our customers, suppliers, or contractors will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection. If a customer files for bankruptcy protection, for example, we likely would be unable to collect all, or even a significant portion, of amounts that are owed to us. A default and bankruptcy filing by one or more customers or suppliers, or events (such as government actions) which prevent or limit our ability to obtain or sell material or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business, financial and operating performance could be adversely affected by epidemics and other health related issues including but not limited to the coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government and has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted supply chains, and has resulted in significant travel, transport, and other restrictions. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the supply chains and day-to-day operations of the Company, our suppliers, our contractors, and our customers, which could materially adversely affect our operations. In this regard, global supply chains and the timely availability of products or product components sourced domestically or imported from other nations, including SWU contained in LEU we purchase, could be materially disrupted by quarantines, slowdowns or shutdowns, border closings, and travel restrictions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic or other global pandemic or health crises. Further, impacts of COVID-19 infections and other COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on our management and workforce, or our suppliers, contractors, or customers, could adversely impact our business. While we have taken steps to protect our workforce and carry on operations, we may not be able to mitigate all of the potential impacts. We anticipate increased costs related to, or resulting from, the COVID-19 pandemic, due to, among other things, delays in supplier deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, site access and quarantine requirements, and the impacts of remote work and adjusted work schedules.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been primarily affecting our technical solutions segment since much of the work required under the HALEU Contract must be performed on the Company\u2019s sites and on our suppliers\u2019 sites. As a result, our costs under the HALEU Contract have been impacted. Further, as a result of the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) not supplying us cylinders as required under the HALEU Contract, operation of the cascade has been deferred and will be performed under a subsequent competitively bid contract that may or may not be awarded to us.\nIn the event that the COVID-19 pandemic prevents our employees or our contractors from working in-person at our site or, our suppliers are unable to provide goods and services on the schedule we anticipated, the impacts on our schedule and costs could be material. Again, while we have worked to mitigate the impact, we are experiencing increased costs as the result of the impact of the pandemic on their operations.\nWe continue to work with our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance in future periods,\nincluding our ability to execute our strategic plan and programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any potential subsequent variants of COVID-19 and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or on government budgets, our customers, contractors and suppliers that could impact our business are also difficult to predict but could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe continued excess supply of LEU in the market could adversely affect market prices and our business results.\nEvents related to the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused irreparable damage to four reactors in Fukushima, Japan created an over-supply of nuclear fuel that continues to heavily influence market prices. In addition, reactor operators facing aggressive price competition from natural gas and subsidized renewable generation like wind and solar, have closed or are planning to close reactors, further reducing demand for our product and services. Despite the decrease in demand, some of our competitors supported by foreign governments continued to expand their capacity. Market uncertainty, and reduced demand, coupled with excess capacity and supply has adversely affected our ability to sell LEU and SWU and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur business is exposed to price volatility associated the procurement of SWU and uranium.\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk for purchases of SWU and uranium. Our earnings and cash flows are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates. The supply markets for SWU and uranium are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions.\nOperational Risks\nRestrictions on imports or sales of SWU or uranium that we buy from our Russian supplier and our other sources of supply could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business.\nThe majority of the SWU and LEU that we use to fill existing contracts with customers is sourced from outside the United States, including from Russia under the TENEX Supply Agreement, and we expect the arrangement to continue into the future. Our ability to place this SWU and LEU into existing and future contracts with customers is subject to trade restrictions, sanctions, and other limitations imposed by the United States and other governments and our customers. For example, our imports from Russia are subject to U.S. quotas. Given the quotas, restrictions, and customer limitations that limit our ability to sell SWU and LEU purchased under the TENEX Supply Agreement both in the United States and globally, there is no guarantee that we can make sufficient sales to meet our minimum purchase obligation under the TENEX Supply Agreement. (For further information refer to Part I, Item 1, Competition and Foreign Trade).\nFurther, currently evolving international events, including the war in Ukraine could result in new or additional sanctions or other U.S. or foreign government actions that could directly or indirectly limit or prevent our purchase, importation, or ability to sell material under our TENEX Supply Agreement. Even absent such restrictions, some of our U.S. and foreign customers are unable or unwilling to accept Russian SWU and uranium.\nGeopolitical events, including domestic or international reactions or responses to such events, as well as concerns about national security or other issues, also could lead to U.S. or foreign government or international actions that could disrupt our ability to purchase, sell, or make deliveries of LEU, SWU, or other uranium products, or even to continue to do business with one or more of our suppliers or their affiliates. Our inability to meet our purchase or sales obligations, or to earn revenues from U.S. and international sales, would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the viability of our business. All of these outcomes, individually and collectively, could cause us to incur significant financial losses, in addition to impeding or preventing us from fulfilling our existing contracts, or winning new contracts, and could adversely affect our profitability and the viability of our business.\nWe may be unable to sell all of the LEU we are required to purchase under supply agreements for prices that cover our costs, which could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from supply agreements we enter into. The prices we are charged under some supply agreements are determined by formulas that may not be aligned with the prevailing market prices at the time we enter into contracts with customers. As a result, the sales prices in our contracts may not cover our purchase costs, or those purchase costs may limit our ability to secure profitable sales.\nWe are dependent on purchases from our suppliers and other sources to meet our obligations to customers and rely on third parties to provide essential services.\nWe are currently dependent on purchases from suppliers to meet our obligations to customers, including purchases from the Russian government entity, TENEX. A significant delay in, or stoppage or termination of, deliveries of material to us under our supply agreements, could adversely affect our ability to make deliveries to customers. The recent action of Russian military forces in Ukraine has escalated tensions between Russia and the U.S. The U.S. has imposed, and is likely to impose additional, financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain Russian organizations and/or individuals. Sanctions and export controls, as well as any actions by Russia, could adversely affect our supply and our ability to meet our obligations to customers.\nWe also rely on third parties to provide essential services to the Company, such as the storage and management of inventory, transportation, and radiation protection. Those service providers may not perform on time, with the desired quality, or at all for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control. An interruption of deliveries from our suppliers or the provision of essential services by third parties, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe face significant competition from major producers who may be less cost sensitive or may be favored due to support from foreign governments.\nWe compete with major producers of LEU, all of which are wholly or substantially owned by governments: Orano (France), Rosatom/TENEX (Russia), Urenco (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and two German utilities), and CNEIC (China). Our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Foreign competitors enjoy financial and other support from their government owners, which may enable them to be less cost or profit-sensitive than we are. In addition, decisions by foreign competitors may be influenced by political and economic policy considerations rather than commercial considerations. For example, foreign competitors may elect to increase their production or exports of LEU, SWU, or other uranium products, including HALEU, even when not justified by market conditions, thereby depressing prices and reducing demand for our LEU, SWU, and other uranium products. This could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, our competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of improved market conditions and increase capacity to meet any future market expansion.\nThe ability to compete in certain foreign markets may be limited for legal, political, economic or other reasons.\nDoing business in foreign markets poses additional risks and challenges. For example, agreements for cooperation between the U.S. government and various foreign governments or governmental agencies control the export of nuclear materials from the United States. We are unable to supply fuel for foreign reactors unless there is an agreement for cooperation in force. If an agreement with a country in which one or more of our customers is located were to lapse, terminate, or be amended, our sales or deliveries could be curtailed or terminated, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, the lack of such agreements for cooperation between the United States government and those governments or agencies in emerging markets may restrict our ability to sell into such markets. Additionally, countries may impose other restrictions on the import or export of material or services.\nPurchases of LEU and SWU by customers in the European Union are subject to a policy of the Euratom Supply Agency that seeks to limit foreign enriched uranium to no more than 20% of European Union consumption per year. Similarly, China has a policy of using Chinese sources of LEU and SWU. Such policies limit our ability to sell in those countries.\nCertain foreign markets lack a comprehensive nuclear liability law that protects suppliers by channeling liability for injury and property damage suffered by third persons from nuclear incidents at a nuclear facility to the facility\u2019s operator. The lack of legal protection for suppliers could adversely affect our ability to compete for sales to meet the growing demand for LEU or SWU in these markets and our prospects for future revenue from such sales.\nDependence on our largest customers could adversely affect us.\nIn 2021, our ten largest nuclear fuel customers represented approximately 57% of total revenue and our two largest customers represented approximately 24% of total revenue. Further, individual orders average $7.4 million. A reduction in purchases from our customers, whether due to their decision not to purchase optional quantities or for other reasons, including a disruption or change in their operations or financial condition that reduces purchases of LEU, SWU, or other uranium products from us, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. Once lost, customers may be difficult to regain because they typically purchase under long-term contracts. Consequently, we may face reduced revenues and difficulty in selling the material we are obligated to buy, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe dollar amount of the sales order book, as stated at any given time, is not necessarily indicative of future sales revenues and is subject to uncertainty.\nOur order book of sales is the estimated aggregate dollar amount of SWU and uranium sales that we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods under existing contracts with customers. It includes deferred revenue for sales in which we have been paid but still have a delivery obligation, which means we will not receive cash in the future from those deliveries. There is no assurance that the revenues projected will be realized, or, if realized, will result in profits. Our estimate of the order book is based on a number of factors including customers\u2019 estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and estimates of future selling prices. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU or uranium market price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are unpredictable. Any inaccuracy in estimates of future prices would add to the imprecision of the order book estimate. From time to time, we have worked with customers to modify contracts that have delivery, scheduling, origin or other terms that may require modifications to address our anticipated supply sources. If we were to initiate such discussions in the future, we have no assurance that our customers would agree to revise existing contracts or would not require concessions, which could adversely affect the value of our order book and our prospects.\nOur ability to operate the HALEU enrichment facility we are deploying under the HALEU Contract after the completion of the deployment is dependent on our ability to secure additional contracts and funding from the U.S. government or other sources.\nIn 2019, Centrus began work on a three-year, cost-shared contract with the DOE to deploy a cascade of 16 of our AC100M centrifuges to demonstrate production of HALEU with domestic technology. As a result of the on-going supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, DOE has been unable to provide the cylinders required to begin HALEU production under the current contract. Consequently, operation of the demonstration cascade will be performed pursuant to a separate subsequent, competitively-awarded contract which may not be awarded to us. Although we believe we are well positioned to compete for the subsequent contract to operate the cascade beginning in 2022, there is no assurance that we will be awarded such contract.\nOur goal is to be in a position to begin production and scale up the facility in modular fashion as demand for HALEU grows in the commercial and/or government sectors. However, our right to operate the facility we are building depends on the award of one or more follow-on contracts by the U.S. government, as well as continued\nfunding for operation from the U.S. government or other sources. There is no assurance that we will be awarded such contracts or that such funding will be available. Further, it is uncertain whether or when demand to support the scale up of the facility will materialize. If we do not secure the necessary contracts and funding and if sufficient demand does not emerge, we may not be able to continue or expand operations at that facility and may not be able to support providing HALEU fuel for the advanced reactors under development.\nIf we are required to delease the facility where we are deploying the HALEU cascade under the HALEU Contract and return it, along with the centrifuges and supporting equipment, to the DOE at the expirations of our contract, this would likely result in the termination of our NRC operating license and us laying off our Piketon workforce. However, if we are able to continue operating the facility, we would incur additional costs and liabilities associated with the facility.\nIf the Company\u2019s operation of the Piketon facility were terminated, there can be no assurance that we could regain use of the Piketon facility or obtain a new NRC license in the future at the Piketon site or an alternative site, in which event we would be unable to begin commercial production of HALEU. We may also incur additional costs related to reducing our workforce or closing the Piketon facility. Failure to secure U.S. government or other funding to support the continued operation of the Piketon facility, and retain our NRC license, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition along with our plans for future growth.\nOur technical solutions segment conducts business under various types of contracts, including fixed-price and cost-share contracts, which subjects us to risks associated with cost over-runs.\nThe technical solutions segment conducts business under various types of contracts, including fixed-price contracts and cost-share contracts, where costs must be estimated in advance of our performance. These types of contracts are priced, in part, on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on assumptions including prices and availability of experienced labor, equipment and materials, and estimates of the amount of other contract work we expect to perform. In the event we have cost overruns, we may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-price or cost-share contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could result in reduced profits, greater costs, or a loss for that contract. If the cost overrun on a contract is significant, or we encounter issues that affect multiple contracts, the cost overrun could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have significant long-term liabilities.\nWe continue to have significant long-term liabilities, including the indebtedness under our 8.25% Notes, which mature in February 2027. We also still have substantial pension and postretirement health and life benefit obligations and other long-term liabilities.\nOur significant long-term liabilities (and other third-party financial obligations) could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to lenders and other creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness or breaches of such other commitments;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage by making us more vulnerable to react to adverse economic conditions or changes in the nuclear industry;\n\u2022hindering our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022reducing our cash resources for payments on our 8.25% Notes thereby limiting our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022placing certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary, United States Enrichment Corporation (\u201cEnrichment Corp.\u201d), to transfer cash and other assets to us, which could constrain our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock or to fund our commitments or the commitments of our other subsidiaries, pursuant to the indenture governing our 8.25% Notes, subject to certain exceptions; and\n\u2022restricting our ability to engage in certain mergers or acquisitions pursuant to the indenture governing our 8.25% Notes also requires us to offer to repurchase all such outstanding notes at 101% of their outstanding principal amount in the event of certain change of control events.\nThe terms of the indenture governing our 8.25% Notes do not restrict Centrus or any of its subsidiaries from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness the foregoing risks would intensify, however. Additional information concerning the 8.25% Notes including the terms and conditions of the 8.25% Notes are described in Note 8, Debt of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has material unfunded defined benefit pension plans obligations and postretirement health and life benefit obligations. Levels of returns on pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and postretirement benefit liabilities could adversely affect earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nCentrus and its subsidiary, Enrichment Corp., maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans that are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d), a wholly-owned U.S. government corporation that was created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). Centrus also maintains non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain executive officers. These plans are anticipated to require material cash contributions in the future, which may divert funds from other uses and could adversely impact our liquidity depending on the timing of any required contributions or payments in relation to our sources of cash and other payment obligations.\nFurther, earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for employee benefit plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require a company to calculate expenses for these plans using actuarial valuations. The IRS and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 regulate the minimum amount we contribute to our pension plans. The amount we are required to contribute to pension plans could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nRevenue is recognized when or as we transfer control of the promised LEU or uranium to the customer. Customer demand is affected by, among other things, electricity markets, reactor operations, maintenance, and the timing of refueling outages. As a result, a relatively small change in the timing, amount, or other terms of customer orders for LEU due to a change in a customer\u2019s refueling schedule or other reasons may cause operating results to be substantially above or below expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nResults of operations could be negatively impacted if adverse conditions or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment loss related to our intangible assets.\nIntangible assets originated from our reorganization and application of fresh start accounting as of September 30, 2014. The intangible assets represented the fair value adjustment to the assets and liabilities for our LEU segment. The intangible assets remaining on our balance sheet relate to our sales order book and customer relationships. The order book intangible asset is amortized to expense as the order book valued at emergence is reduced, principally as a result of deliveries to customers. The customer relationships intangible asset is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful life of 15 years with 7 \u00be years of scheduled amortization remaining.\nThe carrying values of the intangible assets are subject to impairment tests whenever adverse conditions or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment loss. If impairment is indicated, the asset carrying value will be reduced to its fair value. Inherent in our fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including projections of future cash flows, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and strategic plans with regard to operations. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of the intangible asset to be less than its respective carrying amount.\nCentrus is dependent on intercompany support from Enrichment Corp.\nSubstantially all of our revenue-generating operations are conducted at our subsidiary, Enrichment Corp. The financing obtained from Enrichment Corp. funds our general corporate expenses, including interest payments on the 8.25% Notes, which are guaranteed on a limited and subordinated basis by Enrichment Corp. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centrus, Enrichment Corp. has its own set of creditors and a separate board of directors (the \u201cEnrichment Board\u201d), who are elected by Centrus. Current and future funding and support are conditional and dependent on Enrichment Corp.\u2019s own financial condition and a determination by the Enrichment Board that such funding is in the interest of Enrichment Corp.\nThere is limited trading volume for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nThe price of our Class A Common Stock remains subject to volatility. The market price and level of trading of our Class A Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading history, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our Class A Common Stock, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. Additionally, future sales of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, in public or private offerings may depress our stock price.\nHolders of our Class B Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (\u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d and together with the Class A Common Stock, \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) may make decisions regarding their investment in the Company based upon factors that are unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance. Any sales of shares by holders of our Class B Common Stock would result in automatic conversion (with limited exceptions) of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, which in turn could adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nOur 8.25% Notes are not listed on any securities exchange. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the 8.25% Notes. The 8.25% Notes may only be traded infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations for the 8.25% Notes may not be available. In addition, the trading prices of the 8.25% Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the trading volumes, and the other factors discussed above with respect to the Class A Common Stock.\nA small number of holders of our Class A Common Stock may exert significant influence over the direction of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2021, based solely on amounts reported in Schedule 13D and 13G filings with the SEC, two stockholders with the largest holdings of our Class A Common Stock collectively own approximately 19% of our Class A Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger of the Company, or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. These stockholders may have interests that differ from, and may vote in a way adverse to, other holders of Class A Common Stock, or adverse to the recommendations of the Company\u2019s management. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in the Company, may limit the ability of the Company to pass\ncertain initiatives or other items that require stockholder approval, and may also have the effect of delaying, preventing, or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of the Company.\nA small number of Class A stockholders, who also have significant holdings of the Company\u2019s 8.25% Notes, may be motivated by interests that are not aligned with the Company\u2019s other Class A stockholders.\nCurrently, a small number of persons who also are stockholders collectively own greater than 25% of our 8.25% Notes. As a result, these stockholders may have interests that differ from the remainder of the holders of our Class A Common Stock, and, as a result, may vote or take other actions in a way adverse to other holders of Class A Common Stock.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) or net unrealized built-in losses could be limited or eliminated in the event (i) we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as described under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) we do not reach profitability or are only marginally profitable, or (iii) there are changes in U.S. government laws and regulations. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as a greater than 50% change in equity ownership by value over a rolling three-year period. Past or future ownership changes, some of which may be beyond our control, as well as differences and fluctuations in the value of our equity securities may adversely affect our ability to utilize our NOLs and could reduce our flexibility to raise capital in future equity financings or other transactions, or we may decide to pursue transactions even if they would result in an ownership change and impair our ability to use our NOLs. In addition, the \u201cSection 382 Rights Agreement\u201d we have adopted with respect to our common stock contains limitations on transferability intended to prevent the possibility of experiencing an \u201cownership change,\u201d but we cannot be certain that these measures will be effective. We also may decide to pursue transactions even if they would result in an ownership change and impair our ability to use our NOLs. In addition, any changes to tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations could negatively impact our ability to recognize any potential benefits from our NOLs or net unrealized built-in losses.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nOur operations are highly regulated by the U.S. government, including the NRC and the DOE as well as the States of Ohio and Tennessee and could be significantly impacted by changes in government policies and priorities.\nOur operations, including the facilities we lease near Piketon, Ohio, are subject to regulation by the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d). The NRC has granted us two licenses for the Piketon facility: a license for a Lead Cascade test facility that was granted in February 2004, and a separate license to construct and operate a commercial plant that was granted in April 2007. Our license to construct and operate a commercial plant will expire on April 13, 2037. In June 2021, the NRC approved an amendment to permit HALEU production as a subset of the larger commercial plant license. We are currently performing work under a three-year contract with DOE for the construction of a cascade to produce HALEU. This contract is currently set to expire on June 1, 2022.\nThe NRC also could refuse to renew our license to construct and operate a commercial plant if it determines that: (1) we are foreign owned, controlled, or dominated; (2) the issuance of a renewed license would be inimical to the maintenance of a reliable and economic domestic source of enrichment; (3) the issuance of a renewed license would be adverse to U.S. defense or security objectives; or (4) the issuance of a renewed license is otherwise not consistent with applicable laws or regulations in effect at the time of renewal.\nThe NRC has the authority to issue notices of violation for violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the \u201cAtomic Energy Act\u201d), the NRC regulations and conditions of licenses, certificates of compliance, or orders. The NRC has the authority to impose civil penalties or additional requirements and to order cessation of operations for violations of its regulations. Penalties under the NRC regulations could include substantial fines, imposition of additional requirements, or withdrawal or suspension of licenses or certificates. Any penalties\nimposed on us could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The NRC also has the authority to issue new regulatory requirements or to change existing requirements. Changes to the regulatory requirements also could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our operations are subject to DOE regulation or contractual requirements. Our facility in Oak Ridge is also regulated by the State of Tennessee under NRC\u2019s Agreement State Program as well as applicable state laws. Our operations at the facility near Piketon also are subject to regulation by various agencies of the Ohio state government. These state and federal agencies may have the authority to impose civil penalties and additional requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, changes in federal, state or local government policies and priorities can impact our operations and the nuclear industry. This includes changes in interpretations of regulatory requirements, increased inspection or enforcement activities, changes in budgetary priorities, changes in tax laws and regulations and other actions or in-actions governments can take.\nOur operations involve the use, transportation and disposal of toxic, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and could result in liability without regard to fault or negligence.\nOur operations involve the use, transportation, and disposal of toxic, hazardous and radioactive materials. A release of these materials could pose a health risk to humans or animals. If an accident were to occur, its severity would depend on the volume of the release and the speed of corrective action taken by emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions taken in response to an actual or suspected release of these materials, including a precautionary evacuation, could result in significant costs for which we could be legally responsible. In addition to health risks, a release of these materials may cause damage to, or the loss of, property and may adversely affect property values. Additionally, we may be responsible for decontamination or decommissioning of facilities where we conduct, or previously conducted, operations. Activities of our contractors, suppliers or other counterparties similarly may involve toxic, hazardous, and radioactive materials and we may be liable contractually, or under applicable law, to contribute to remedy damages or other costs arising from such activities, including the decontamination or decommission of third-party facilities.\nWe lease facilities from DOE near Piketon, Ohio. Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, as well as the HALEU Contract, DOE has agreed to indemnify the Company\u2019s subsidiaries who are party to those agreements, and other Company entities who fall under the definition of a person indemnified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, against claims for public liability (as defined in the Atomic Energy Act) arising out of or in connection with activities under those leases and the HALEU Contract, as applicable, resulting from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation including transportation. If an incident or evacuation is not covered under DOE indemnification, we could be financially liable for damages arising from such incident or evacuation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile DOE has provided indemnification pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, there could be delays in obtaining reimbursement for costs from DOE and DOE may also determine that some or all costs are not reimbursable under the indemnification. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act indemnification does not cover loss or damage due to a nuclear incident to property located on the leased facilities.\nCentrus and Enrichment Corp. have been named as defendants in class action lawsuits alleging damages resulting from releases at the facilities we leased in the past at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and the centrifuge facilities we still lease near Piketon, Ohio. These claims include allegations of damages that the plaintiffs assert are not covered by the Price-Anderson Act, which claims we and the other defendants have challenged. If DOE were to determine that the Price-Anderson Act did not apply, we would have to pay all or part of any damages awarded as a result of such claims, the cost to us, including legal fees, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters, of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report for further details.\nIn our contracts, we seek to protect ourselves from liability, but there is no assurance that such contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases. The costs of defending against a claim arising out of a nuclear\nincident or precautionary evacuation, and any damages awarded as a result of such a claim, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to equity securities held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. If levels of foreign ownership set forth in our certificate of incorporation are exceeded, we have the right, among other things, to redeem or exchange common stock held by foreign persons, and in certain cases, the applicable redemption price or exchange value may be equal to the lower of fair market value or a foreign person\u2019s purchase price.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to shares of our common stock held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. Foreign persons are defined in our certificate of incorporation to include, among others, an individual who is not a U.S. citizen, an entity that is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and an entity that is controlled by individuals who are not U.S. citizens, or by entities that are organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the following events is a \u201cforeign ownership review event\u201d and triggers the board of directors\u2019 right to take various actions under our certificate of incorporation: (1) the beneficial ownership by a foreign person of (a) 5% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities, (b) 5% or more in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, or (c) less than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities or less than 5% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, if such foreign person is entitled to control the appointment and tenure of any of our management positions or any director; (2) the beneficial ownership of any shares of any class of our equity securities by or for the account of a foreign uranium enrichment provider or a foreign competitor (defined in our certificate of incorporation as a \u201cContravening Person\u201d); or (3) any ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, shares of any class of our equity securities or other exercise or attempt to exercise control of us that is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any regulatory restrictions, or that could jeopardize the continued operations of our facilities (defined in our certificate of incorporation as an \u201cAdverse Regulatory Occurrence\u201d). These rights include requesting information from holders (or proposed holders) of our securities, refusing to permit the transfer of securities by such holders, suspending or limiting voting rights of such holders, redeeming or exchanging shares of our stock owned by such holders on terms set forth in our certificate of incorporation, and taking other actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions.\nThe terms and conditions of our rights with respect to our redemption or exchange right in respect of shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons are as follows:\n\u2022Redemption price or exchange value: Generally, the redemption price or exchange value for any shares of our common stock redeemed or exchanged would be their fair market value. However, if we redeem or exchange shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons and our Board in good faith determines that such person knew or should have known that its ownership would constitute a foreign ownership review event (other than shares for which our Board determined at the time of the person\u2019s purchase that the ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, such shares did not at such time constitute an Adverse Regulatory Occurrence), the redemption price or exchange value is required to be the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged.\n\u2022Form of payment: Cash, securities or a combination, valued by our board of directors in good faith.\n\u2022Notice: At least 30 days written notice of redemption is required; however, if we have deposited the cash or securities for the redemption or exchange in trust for the benefit of the relevant holders, we may redeem shares held by such holders on the same day that we provide notice.\nAccordingly, there are situations in which a foreign stockholder or Contravening Person could lose the right to vote its shares or in which we may redeem or exchange shares held by a foreign person or Contravening Person and\nin which such redemption or exchange could be at the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged, which could result in a significant loss for that person.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailures to protect classified or other sensitive information, or security breaches of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems could result in significant liability or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires us to use and protect classified, sensitive, and other protected information as well as business proprietary information and intellectual property (collectively, \u201csensitive information\u201d). Our computer networks and other information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are designed to protect this information through the use of classified networks and other procedures. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to the Company\u2019s sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, attacks by more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other government contractors because we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, the Company\u2019s data, customers\u2019 data, our employees\u2019 data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data could be compromised. As a consequence of the persistence, sophistication, and volume of these attacks, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nWe have a number of suppliers and indirect suppliers with a wide variety of systems and cybersecurity capabilities and we may not be successful in preventing adversaries from exploiting possible weak links in our supply chain. We also must rely on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nA material network breach in the security of the IT systems of the Company or third parties for any reasons, including, but not limited to, human error, could include the theft of sensitive information, including, without limitation, our and our customers\u2019 business proprietary and intellectual property. To the extent any security breach or human error results in a loss or damage to sensitive information, or in inappropriate or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, the breach could cause grave damage to the country\u2019s national security and to our business. Threats, via insider threat or third parties, to our IT systems, are constantly evolving and there is no assurance that our efforts to maintain and improve our IT systems will be sufficient to meet current or future threats. Any event leading to a security breach or loss of, or damage to, data, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In an extreme case, DOE could terminate our permit to access classified information resulting in the elimination of our ability to continue American Centrifuge work or performance of DOE contracts, including the HALEU Contract.\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe Company\u2019s LEU and technical services segments require people with unique skills and experience in the uranium enrichment industry. It also requires people with U.S. security clearances. To train employees and obtain the required U.S. Security clearances for them can take considerable time and expense. The success of our business depends on key executives, managers, scientists, engineers and other skilled personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances.\nChanges in senior management could create uncertainty among our employees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties with which we do business. The inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could negatively affect our operations, strategic planning, and performance.\nThe potential for DOE to seek to terminate or exercise its remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and our other agreements with DOE, or to require modifications to such agreements that are adverse to our interests, may have adverse consequences on the Company.\nThe Company and DOE signed an agreement dated June 17, 2002, as amended (the \u201c2002 DOE-USEC Agreement\u201d), that requires the Company to develop, demonstrate, and deploy advanced enrichment technology in accordance with milestones and provides for remedies in the event of a failure to meet a milestone under certain circumstances. DOE has specific remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement if we fail to meet a milestone or if we abandon or constructively abandon the commercial deployment of an advanced enrichment technology. These remedies include terminating the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement, revoking our access to DOE\u2019s centrifuge technology that is required for the success of the American Centrifuge project, the HALEU Contract or other projects, requiring us to transfer certain rights in the American Centrifuge technology and facilities to DOE, and to reimburse DOE for certain costs associated with the American Centrifuge project.\nWe have granted to DOE an irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use or permit third parties on behalf of DOE to use all centrifuge technology intellectual property (\u201cCentrifuge IP\u201d) royalty free for U.S. government purposes (which includes national defense purposes, including providing nuclear material to operate commercial nuclear power reactors for tritium production). We also granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to DOE to use such Centrifuge IP developed at our expense for commercial purposes (including a right to sublicense), which may be exercised only if we miss any of the milestones under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement or if we (or our affiliate or entity acting through us) are no longer willing or able to proceed with, or have determined to abandon, or have constructively abandoned, the commercial deployment of the centrifuge technology. Such a commercial purposes license is subject to payment of an agreed upon royalty to us, which will not exceed $665 million in the aggregate. While our long-term objective is to commercially deploy the American Centrifuge technology when it is commercially feasible to do so, DOE may take the position that we are no longer willing or able to proceed with commercial deployment, or have actually, or constructively, abandoned commercial deployment, and could invoke its rights under the license described above. Any of these actions could adversely impact our business and prospects.\nDOE may seek to exercise remedies under these agreements and there is no assurance that the parties will be able to reach agreement on appropriate modifications to the agreements in the future. Moreover, even if the parties reach agreement on modifications to such agreements, there is no assurance that such modifications will not impose material additional requirements, provide DOE with material additional rights or remedies, or otherwise affect the overall economics of the American Centrifuge technology and our ability to finance and successfully deploy the technology. Any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nOur U.S. government contract work is regularly reviewed and audited by the U.S. government and these reviews can lead to withholding or delay of payments to us, non-receipt of award fees, legal actions, fines, penalties and liabilities, and other remedies against us.\nOur U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, among others, and also subject to audits, cost reviews, and investigations by the U.S. government contracting oversight agencies. Should a contracting agency determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contracts and applicable statutes and regulations, payments to us may be disallowed, which could result in adjustments to previously reported revenues and refunding of previously collected cash proceeds. Additionally, we may be subject to litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the Federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. If we experience performance issues under any of our U.S. government contracts, the U.S. government retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Termination of a contract could adversely affect our ability to secure future\ncontracts, and could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur U.S. government contracts and subcontracts are dependent on continued U.S. government funding and government appropriations, which may not be made on a timely basis or at all, and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCurrent and future U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, including our HALEU Contract, are dependent on government funding, which are generally subject to Congressional appropriations. Our ability to perform under these federal contracts and subcontracts is dependent upon sufficient funding for, and timely payment by, the entities with which we have contracted. If the contracting governmental agency, or the prime contractor, does not receive sufficient appropriations, it may terminate our contract or subcontract (in whole or in part) or reduce scope of our contract or subcontract, or delay or reduce payment to us. Any inability to award us a contract or subcontract, any delay in payment, or the termination of a contract or subcontract, in whole or in part, due to a lapse in funding or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges to, or termination of, any agreements with the U.S. government, or deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. government, could adversely affect results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of agreements and arrangements with the U.S. government that are important to our business including our HALEU Contract, the lease for the centrifuge facility near Piketon, Ohio, and the 2002 DOE-USEC agreement. Termination, expiration, or modification of one or more of these or other agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. agencies that are parties to these agreements could impair or impede our ability to successfully implement these agreements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur success depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing competitive environment in the nuclear industry.\nThe uranium enrichment sector of the nuclear fuel cycle industry remains oversupplied, creating downward pressures on commodity pricing, with uncertainty regarding nuclear power generation. Changes in the competitive landscape may adversely affect pricing trends, change customer spending patterns, or create uncertainty. To address these changes, we may seek to adjust our cost structure and operations, and evaluate opportunities to grow our business organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We are actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential strategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, changes in our capital structure, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products, or technologies. In connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner with other parties to consummate a transaction. Any such transaction may not result in the intended benefits and could involve significant commitments of our financial and other resources. Legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with debt or equity financing transactions in development are deferred and subject to immediate expensing if such a transaction becomes less likely to occur. If the actions we take in response to industry changes are not successful, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86233, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "LEU"}
