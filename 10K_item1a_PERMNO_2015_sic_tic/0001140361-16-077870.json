RISK FACTORS\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nWe continued to experience core revenue growth in fiscal year 2016 as we saw the benefits of our marketing activities in all of our target markets. Revenue increased 8% to $33.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 driven by increases in the professional market due primarily to targeted telemarketing initiatives and promotional activities, continued rollout of new patient support programs in the pharmaceutical market and increases in the home health care and assisted living markets. The increase in revenue and execution of our growth strategies has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our financial, operational and management resources. In order to continue our growth, we may need at some point to add operations, administrative and other personnel and to make additional investments in the infrastructure and systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel, do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required.\nIf the flu related business of our customers decreases, the revenues generated by our business could decrease.\nOur operating results are dependent in part upon the amount and types of solutions necessary to service our customers\u2019 needs which are heavily influenced by the total number of patients our customers are serving at any time, especially related to the administration of flu shots. At times of lower patient activity, our customers have a decreased need for our services on a supplemental or peak needs basis. Our operating results can vary depending on the timing and severity of the flu season as well as other factors affecting the volume of flu shots administered in the retail setting.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to, seasonality; the timing of inventory builds for patient support programs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer customers; the timing and severity of the flu season; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, heathcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.\nOur business is dependent on a small number of customers. To the extent we are not successful in winning additional business mandates from our government and commercial customers or attracting new customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a small group of customers. In addition, there is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from sales to our major customers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, one customer represented approximately 17% of revenue. This customer also represented approximately 17%, or $1.0 million, of the total accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2016. To the extent significant customers are delinquent or delayed in paying, or we are not successful in obtaining consistent and additional business from our existing and new customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe loss of the Company\u2019s senior executives could affect the Company\u2019s ability to manage the business profitability.\nOur growth and development to date has been largely dependent on the active participation and leadership of our senior management team consisting of the Company\u2019s CEO and President, Senior Vice President of Sales, Vice President and CFO, Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Quality Assurance and Vice President of Marketing. We believe that the continued success of the business is largely dependent upon the continued employment of the senior management team and have, therefore, (i) entered into individual employment arrangements with key personnel and (ii) approved the Compensation and Incentive Plan for participation by the senior management team in order to provide an incentive for their continued employment with the Company. The unplanned loss of one or more members of the senior management team and our inability to hire key employees could disrupt and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business plan.\nThe Board of Directors oversees CEO and senior management succession planning. The process focuses on building management depth, considers continuity and stability within the Company and responds to Sharps\u2019 evolving needs and changing circumstances. The Board approves continuity plans for the CEO and senior management succession planning to enable the Board to respond to planned or unexpected vacancies in key positions. The Board considers optimizing the ongoing safe and sound operation of the Company and minimizing any potential disruption or loss of continuity to our business and operations as it evaluates the plan.\nRisks associated with our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect a portion of our growth to come from acquisitions, and we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and the Company\u2019s financial and other resources. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions, if completed, will be successful.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down the Company\u2019s profits and slow its growth.\nThere are several competitors who offer similar or identical products and services that facilitate the disposal of smaller quantities of medical waste. There are also a number of companies that focus specifically on the marketing of products and services, which facilitate disposal through transport by the USPS (similar to the Company\u2019s products). These companies include (i) smaller private companies or (ii) divisions of larger companies. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with Stericycle, the largest medical waste company in the country, which focuses primarily on a pickup service business model. As Sharps continues to grow and increase awareness of the proper disposal of syringes and unused medications, it could face additional and possibly significant competition. As a result, we could experience increased pricing pressures that could reduce our margins. In addition, as we expand our business into other markets, the number, type and size of our competitors may expand. Many of these potential competitors may have greater financial and operational resources, flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could adversely impact our current competitive position.\nThe lack of customer long-term volume commitments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits and future growth.\nAlthough we enter into exclusive contracts with the majority of our enterprise customers, these contracts do not have provisions for firm long-term volume commitments. In general, customer purchase orders may be canceled and order volume levels can be changed or delayed with limited or no penalties. Canceled, delayed or reduced purchase orders could significantly affect our financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to extensive and costly federal, state and local laws, and existing or future regulations may restrict the Company\u2019s operations, increase our costs of operations and subject us to additional liability.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and/or local laws, rules and regulations. We are required to obtain permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permission from the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the state of Texas, the state of Pennsylvania and local governments with respect to our facilities and operations. Such laws, rules and regulations have been established to promote occupational safety and health standards and certain standards have been established in connection with the handling, transportation and disposal of certain types of medical and solid wastes, including transported medical waste. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations governing our business, including the permits and authorizations for our incinerator facility. Our estimated annual costs of complying with these laws, regulations and guidelines, including environmental laws, is currently less than $200,000 per year. In the event additional laws, rules or regulations are adopted which affect our business, additional expenditures may be required in order for us to be in compliance with such changing laws, rules and regulations. Furthermore, any material relaxation of any existing regulatory requirements governing the transportation and disposal of medical waste could result in a reduced demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition. The scope and duration of existing and future regulations affecting the medical and solid waste disposal industry cannot be anticipated and are subject to change.\nIn November 2005 and September 2009, the EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality promulgated new regulations under the Clean Air Act and associated state statutes, which affect the incineration portion of our operation of the treatment facility located in Carthage, Texas. These regulations modified the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility. These new regulations and the Company\u2019s Title V permit required additional emissions-related monitoring and compliance. Such changes required us to incur capital expenditures, which have been reflected in cash flows from investing activities in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of cash flows in order to meet the requirements of the new regulations.\nThe inability of the Company to operate its treatment facility would adversely affect its operations.\nOur business utilizes a treatment facility for the proper disposal or treatment of medical waste, used health care materials and unused pharmaceuticals. Our owned facility has both incineration and autoclave technologies in Carthage, Texas. Sharps believes it operates and maintains the facility in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws and/or any other regulatory agency requirements involving treatment and disposal and the operation of the incinerator and autoclave facility. The failure to maintain the permits for the treatment facility or unfavorable conditions contained in the permits or new regulations could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues. During fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the Company, under agreements with several subcontractors, utilized ten treatment facilities owned by subcontractors of the Company, which are located across the country for the proper treatment of medical waste and used healthcare materials generated by our customers. This has not only reduced the Company\u2019s return transportation costs but also provides back-up treatment facility capabilities in the event of disruption at the Company\u2019s treatment facility in Carthage, Texas. In August 2016, the Company received the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Waste Management permit for the processing of medical waste as its treatment facility located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The 40,000 square foot facility has been permitted as both a medical waste treatment facility, using an autoclave, and as a transfer station for medical, pharmaceutical and trace chemotherapy waste of up to 82 tons per day. The facility is designed to cost-effectively and efficiently process medical waste generated by the Company\u2019s route-based and mailback customers and also doubles as a distribution center of mailback solutions. Any disruption in the availability of a disposal or treatment facility, whether as a result of action taken by governmental authorities, natural disasters or otherwise, would have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations.\nThe handling and disposal or treatment of regulated waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others.\nOur business requires us to handle materials that may be infectious or hazardous to life and property in other ways. Although our products and procedures are designed to minimize exposure to these materials, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills and acts of God always exists. Examples of possible exposure to such materials include: truck accidents, damaged or leaking containers, improper storage of regulated waste by customers, improper placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as certain body parts and tissues; or malfunctioning treatment plant equipment. Human beings, animals or property could be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us. While we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\nAn inability to win additional government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and adversely affect our future revenue.\nA material amount of our revenues was generated through a contract with a major U.S. government agency for the period from March 2009 through the contract\u2019s termination in January 2012 totaling $33 million. In the years subsequent to the contract\u2019s termination, our Company-wide revenues experienced a decrease compared to prior periods. Although the Company has secured some U.S. government business during fiscal year 2016, there can be no assurances that future periods will include similar business. All contracts with, or subcontracts involving, the federal government are terminable or subject to renegotiation by the applicable governmental agency on 30 days\u2019 notice at the option of the governmental agency. If a material contract is terminated or renegotiated in a manner that is materially adverse to us, our revenues and future operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nGovernmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities are often subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable regulations and contractual provisions. If we fail to comply with any regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities could be terminated, or we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our governmental contracts or subcontracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or barred from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. Furthermore, as a result of our governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes.\nThe possibility of postal work interruptions and restrictions on shipping through the mail would adversely affect the disposal or treatment element of the Company\u2019s business and have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently transport (from the patient or user to the Company\u2019s facility or subcontracted treatment facilities) the majority of our solution offerings using USPS; therefore, any long-term interruption in USPS delivery services would disrupt the return transportation and treatment element of our business. Postal delivery interruptions are rare. Additionally, since USPS employees are federal employees, such employees may be prohibited from engaging in or continuing a postal work stoppage, although there can be no assurance that such work stoppage can be avoided. As noted above, we entered into an arrangement with UPS whereby UPS transports our TakeAway Recovery System line of solution offerings. The ability to ship items, whether through the USPS or UPS, is regulated by the government and related agencies. Any change in regulation restricting the shipping of medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused or expired dispensed pharmaceuticals through these channels would be detrimental to our ability to conduct operations. Any disruption in the transportation of products would have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, low trading volume and price volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) under the symbol \u201cSMED.\u201d The daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. Over the past three years, the Company\u2019s common stock has had an average trading volume of approximately 63,000 shares traded per month. It may be difficult for investors to sell shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe rely upon sophisticated information technology systems, infrastructure and security procedures and systems to operate our business and ensure the secure storage and transmission of information. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of sensitive data. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents or error or misconduct by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or to sabotage computer systems change frequently, it may be difficult to detect immediately and we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, none of which have materially impacted our operations or financial results. Although we maintain a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users or otherwise damage our reputation. Depending on the severity, any of these events could adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of time and money to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 92935, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "SMED"}
