{"cik": "899751", "company": "TITAN INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, relating to or arising out of the nature of its business and general business, economic, financing, legal, and other factors or conditions that may affect the Company. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations and, in turn, the value of Titan securities. In addition, other risks not presently known or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect Titan's business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of Titan securities, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report.\n\u2022\nThe Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities.\nThe Company uses various raw materials, most significantly steel and rubber, in manufacturing products across all of its market segments. The Company does not generally enter into long-term commodity contracts and does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to commodity market price fluctuations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities. Although the Company attempts to pass on certain material price increases to its customers, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future. Any increase in the price of steel and rubber that is not passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on a limited number of suppliers.\nThe Company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber, in the manufacturing of Titan products. If the Company's suppliers are unable to provide raw materials to Titan in a timely manner, or are unable to meet quality, quantity, or cost requirements, the Company may not in all cases be able to promptly obtain substitute sources. Any extended delay in receiving critical materials could impair Titan's ability to deliver products to its customers. The loss of key suppliers, the inability to establish relationships with replacement suppliers, or the inability of Titan's suppliers to meet price, quality, quantity, and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants that could limit how the Company conducts its business.\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants and restrictions. These covenants and restrictions could limit Titan\u2019s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends, or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. Titan\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions.\n\u2022\nThe Company operates in cyclical industries and is subject to numerous changes in the economy.\nThe Company's sales are substantially dependent on three major industries: agricultural equipment, earthmoving/construction equipment, and consumer products. The business activity levels in these industries are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Any downturn in these industries or the general economy could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\nThe agricultural equipment industry is affected by crop prices, farm income and farmland values, weather, export markets, and government policies. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by the levels of government and private construction spending and replacement demand. The mining industry, which is within the earthmoving/construction industry, is affected by raw material commodity prices. The consumer products industry is affected by consumer disposable income, weather, competitive pricing, energy prices, and consumer attitudes. In addition, the performance of these industries is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes and varies with the overall level of economic activity.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are seasonal in nature due to Titan\u2019s dependence on seasonal industries.\nThe agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and recreational industries are seasonal, with typically lower sales during the second half of the year. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. Because much of Titan\u2019s overhead expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause volatility in profit margins and financial condition when comparing results from consecutive quarters.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is relatively concentrated.\nThe Company\u2019s ten largest customers, which are primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accounted for 34% of Titan\u2019s net sales for 2016. Net sales to Deere & Company represented 9% of total 2016 net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 7% of net sales in 2016. Titan\u2019s business could be adversely affected if one of its larger customers reduces, or otherwise eliminates in full, its purchases from Titan due to work stoppages or slow-downs, financial difficulties, as a result of termination provisions, competitive pricing, or other reasons. There is also continuing pressure from the OEMs to reduce costs, including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as Titan, and the risk of OEMs developing in-house tire and wheel capabilities. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to maintain its relationships with its current customers, including its most significant customers. Any failure to maintain the Company\u2019s relationship with any of its leading customers could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies.\nDomestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer products industries in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies in the agricultural industry include those encouraging farm acreage reduction in the United States and granting ethanol subsidies. Regulations and policies relating to the earthmoving/construction industry include the construction of roads, bridges, and other items of infrastructure. The modification of existing laws, regulations, or policies, or the adoption of new laws, regulations, or policies could have an adverse effect on any one or more of these industries and, therefore, on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements, and costs related to compliance with, or failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect Titan\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly restrictive. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and the value of the Company\u2019s securities.\n\u2022\nThe Company faces substantial competition from domestic and international companies.\nThe Company competes with several domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan. The Company competes primarily on the basis of price, quality, customer service, design capability, and delivery time. The Company\u2019s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. In addition, certain OEM customers could elect to manufacture certain products to meet their own requirements or to otherwise compete with Titan. The success of the Company's business depends in large part on its ability to provide comprehensive wheel and tire assemblies to its customers. The development or enhancement by Titan's competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect its business.\nThere can be no assurance that Titan\u2019s businesses will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets, or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective or less expensive than Titan products or which could render certain products less competitive. From time to time certain competitors have reduced prices in particular product categories, which has caused Titan to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that in the future Titan\u2019s competitors will not further reduce prices, or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be affected by unfair trade.\nTitan faces intense competition from producers both in the United States and around the world, some of which may engage in unfair trade practices. In early January 2016, Titan, along with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Worker International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that imported off-the-road tires from India and Sri Lanka and wheel and tire assemblies from China were being dumped and/or subsidized and were a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for further details regarding these proceedings. Unfair trade may have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.\n\u2022\nThe Company could be negatively impacted if Titan fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nThe Company was previously party to three collective bargaining agreements with separate locals of the USW and covering certain of its employees in Des Moines, Iowa, Freeport, Illinois, and Bryan, Ohio. Each of the three collective bargaining agreements covering its employees in the U.S., which were originally scheduled to expire in November 2016, was extended until January 2017 and each agreement has since expired. Notwithstanding the expiration of the three agreements, and in keeping with its obligations under Federal labor law, Titan is presently in negotiations with the USW. If Titan is unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements that are satisfactory to the Company, the employees covered thereby could engage in strikes, or the Company may otherwise experience work slowdowns or be subject to other labor actions. Any such actions, and any other labor disputes with the Company's employees domestically or internationally, could materially disrupt its operations. New collective bargaining agreements may impose significant additional costs on Titan, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities pertaining to, legal judgments. Any adverse outcome in any litigation involving Titan or any of its subsidiaries could negatively affect the Company's business, reputation, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nAcquisitions/divestitures may require significant resources and/or result in significant losses, costs, or liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions or divestitures will depend on the ability to identify suitable candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms, and to finance acquisitions. Titan will also face competition for suitable acquisition candidates, which may increase costs. In addition, acquisitions and divestitures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from current operations. Furthermore, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks, including:\n- problems with effective integration or separation of operations, including challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies throughout an acquired business;\n- potential disruption of the Company's ongoing business and the distraction of management from its day-to-day operations;\n- the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition customer, supplier, and employee relationships;\n- the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and operating costs increase; and\n- exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nInternational acquisitions or divestitures may be more complex and time consuming. Also, international acquisitions and divestitures may include a number of additional risks, including the integration of acquisitions or separation of divestitures operating under differing laws and regulations.\nSubject to the terms of its existing indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness, and/or by issuing additional equity securities. These commitments may impair the operation of Titan\u2019s businesses. In addition, the Company could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness, such as reducing liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness.\n\u2022\nThe Company has international operations and purchases raw material from foreign suppliers.\nThe Company had total aggregate sales outside the United States of approximately $707.2 million, $750.2 million and $1,028.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales outside the United States have become a significant proportion of total sales, accounting for 56%, 54% and 54% for the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales from these international operations are expected to continue to represent a similar portion of total sales.\nInternational Operations and Sales - International operations and sales are subject to a number of special risks, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates, economic and political destabilization, other disruption of markets, and restrictive actions by foreign governments (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, export duties, and quotas and foreign customs). Other risks include changes in foreign laws regarding trade and investment; difficulties in obtaining distribution and support; nationalization; reforms of United States laws and policies affecting trade, foreign investment, and loans; and changes in foreign tax and other laws. There may also be restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and investments from international operations. There can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to increase or maintain its foreign sales.\nForeign Suppliers - The Company purchases raw materials from foreign suppliers. The production costs, profit margins, and competitive position of the Company are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where Titan purchases goods, relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the products are sold. The Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial position may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nThe Company has international operations and must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA prohibits these payments regardless of local customs and practices. Violations of these laws could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be subject to product liability and warranty claims.\nThe Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects and, accordingly, may be subject to product liability or product warranty claims in the ordinary course of business. Losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in Titan products, which could subject the Company to claims for damages, including consequential damages. There can be no assurance that Company insurance will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that adequate insurance will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding Titan\u2019s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Further, claims of defects could result in negative publicity against Titan, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, net losses.\nThe Company reported loss before income taxes of $32.9 million, $52.0 million, and $152.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and may incur losses in the future. There is no guarantee the Company will be profitable in the future. Any failure by Titan to obtain or sustain profitability could cause the price of Titan common stock to decline significantly.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by a disruption in, or failure of, information technology systems.\nThe Company relies upon information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. Technology systems are used in a variety of business processes and activities, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and financial reporting. The Company utilizes security measures and business continuity plans to prevent, detect, and remediate damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, utility failures, and other similar disruptions. Despite these measures, a security breach or information technology system failure may disrupt and adversely affect the Company's operations. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer or employee information could adversely impact the Company's reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with climate change regulations.\nGovernmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries have adopted, or are contemplating introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Laws and regulations regarding climate change and energy usage may impact the Company directly through higher costs for energy and raw materials. The Company\u2019s customers may also be affected by climate change regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products. Physical climate change may potentially have a large impact on the Company\u2019s two largest industry segments, agriculture and earthmoving/construction. The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company\u2019s operations entail risks in these areas, and there can be no assurance that Titan will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Titan\u2019s customers may also be affected by environmental laws and regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to foreign currency translation risk.\nThe Company continues to expand globally and now operates in many worldwide locations and transacts business in many foreign currencies. Titan's financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with financial statements of international subsidiaries being initially recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars. Large fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other world currencies may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\n\u2022\nThe Company may incur additional tax expense or tax exposure.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and has domestic and international tax liabilities which are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Titan's income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with uncertainties related to social, political, and economic conditions in Russia and Brazil.\nGeopolitical and economic uncertainties relating to Russia and Brazil have and could continue to have a negative impact on the Company's sales and results of operations at the Company's Russian and Brazilian operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with failure to maintain adequate disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company has previously disclosed a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could affect the accuracy and timing of the Company\u2019s financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting involves significant costs and could divert management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to Titan's business. If the Company\u2019s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls, its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, which, together with any identified material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal controls, could subject the Company to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes, and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in its financial reporting, its credibility in the marketplace and the trading price of Titan's common stock.\n\u2022\nThe Company is not insured against all potential losses and could be harmed by natural disasters, catastrophes, or sabotage.\nThe Company's business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged, including as a result of natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes or by sabotage. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, as well as damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity and efficiency, which could have a material adverse impact on Titan's business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79198, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "TWI"}
