{"cik": "1535031", "company": "Tumi Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is sensitive to consumer spending and general economic conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary premium items, which include all our products, may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, wage and salary levels, trends in consumer confidence and spending, reductions in consumer net worth, interest rates, inflation, the availability of consumer credit and taxation policies. Consumer purchases in general may decline during recessions, periods of prolonged declines in the equity markets or housing markets and periods when disposable income and perceptions of consumer wealth are lower, and these risks may be exacerbated for us due to our focus on discretionary premium items. A downturn in the global economy, or in a regional economy in which we have significant sales, could have a material, deleterious effect on consumer purchases of our products, our results of operations and our financial position, and a downturn adversely affecting our affluent consumer base or travelers could have a disproportionate impact on our business. In particular, there continues to be volatility in the European markets and there are no assurances that the European or global economy will continue to recover. If the European or global economy weakens or deteriorates, there will likely be a negative effect on our net sales in Europe and globally unless and until economic conditions in that region improve and the prospects of national debt defaults in Europe decline. Further or future downturns may adversely affect traffic at our stores and other retail locations, and at the retail locations of our wholesale customers, and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and growth strategy.\nA decrease in travel levels could negatively impact sales of our travel goods.\nSales of travel goods, which comprised approximately 43% of our net sales in 2014, are significantly dependent on travel as a driver of consumer demand. The growing \u201cwealth effect\u201d in emerging markets and the growth in low-cost airlines in both developed and emerging economies, among other factors, have contributed to increased travel levels and increased spending on travel goods over the past ten years, which has in turn contributed to our growth. A significant portion of our consumers travel by air, and many of our products are targeted at travelers in general and at air travelers in particular. The travel industry is highly susceptible to certain kinds of events that can depress travel generally and accordingly depress demand for travel and travel-related products, including outbreaks of contagious disease, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. Additionally, adverse changes in global economic conditions can have a negative effect on business and leisure travel. If the travel industry is impacted, either globally or in any region in which we have significant operations, by events that depress travel levels, sales of our travel goods could decline significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on independent manufacturers and suppliers.\nWe outsource the manufacture and assembly of all our products to companies located in Asia and the Caribbean. We do not control our independent manufacturers and suppliers or their labor and other business practices. Violations of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could disrupt the shipments of our products or draw negative publicity for us, thereby diminishing the value of our brand, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our net income. Additionally, since we do not manufacture our products, we are subject to risks associated with inventory and product quality-control.\nFurther, we have not historically entered into written manufacturing contracts with our manufacturers. Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer\u2019s quality control, responsiveness and service capabilities, financial stability and labor practices. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for alternative sourcing, we may be unable, in the event of a significant disruption in our sourcing, to locate alternative manufacturers or suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, which could result in product shortages or decreases in product quality, and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin, net income, customer relationships and our reputation.\nWe depend on the strength of the Tumi brand.\nWe currently derive substantially all of our net sales from sales of Tumi branded products. The reputation and integrity of the Tumi brand are essential to the success of our business. We believe that our consumers value the status and reputation of the Tumi brand, and the superior quality, performance, functionality and durability that our brand represents. Maintaining and enhancing the status and reputation of the Tumi brand image are also important to expanding our consumer base. Our continued success and growth depend on our ability to protect and promote the Tumi brand, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, performance, functionality and durability of our products, the image of our company-owned and partner stores, our\ncommunication activities, including advertising and public relations, and our management of the consumer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service and warranty repairs. We may need to make substantial investments in these areas in order to maintain and enhance our brand, and such investments may not be successful. Additionally, to the extent our third-party distributors fail to comply with our operating guidelines, we may not be successful in protecting our brand image and controlling our store appearance. Product defects, product recalls, counterfeit products, significant discounts by wholesalers, ineffective marketing and local labor practices are among the potential threats to the strength of our brand. To protect our brand\u2019s status, we may need to make substantial expenditures to mitigate the impact of such threats. In addition, if we fail to continue to innovate so that our products are no longer deemed to achieve superior levels of function, quality and design, or to otherwise be sufficiently distinguishable from our competitors\u2019 products, or if we fail to manage the growth of our store base in a way that protects the high-end nature of our brand, the value of the Tumi brand may be diluted, and we may not be able to maintain our premium position and pricing or sales volumes, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business. In addition, we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand image in new markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to expanding our consumer base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand in new markets, then our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully open new store locations in a timely and profitable manner which could harm our results of operations and our growth strategy.\nFrom January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014, we increased our number of company-owned stores from 84 to 152. Our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to continue to successfully open and operate new company-owned stores. Such ability depends on many factors, some of which are not in our control, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify and obtain suitable store locations;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;\n\u2022\nhire, train, and retain qualified store personnel and field management;\n\u2022\nassimilate new store personnel and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022\ndesign stores that appeal to the markets in which they are located;\n\u2022\nsource sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.\nOur growth strategy includes plans to open new company-owned stores in or near areas where we have existing stores. To the extent we open new stores in markets where we already have stores, we may experience reduced net sales in those existing stores. The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of or after opening our first store in a particular region. Additionally, in opening new company-owned stores, we incur start-up costs and early-stage operating expenses, which may be higher than we expect. New stores may post initial losses and often have lower margins during their early years of operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations. It often takes several years for a new company-owned store to achieve margins comparable with our more mature company-owned stores. Our new company-owned stores may not be received as well as our existing stores and may not meet our financial targets or generate the same profit levels as our existing stores within the time periods that we estimate, or at all. The amount of net sales for any store during its first year of operation is highly dependent on economic conditions in the store\u2019s particular geography, competition and other factors that make it difficult to predict net sales on a store-level basis. If our stores fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business may be materially harmed and we may incur significant costs associated with closing or relocating our stores. Further, as we open new company-owned stores, our operations will become more complex, and managing them will become more challenging. We cannot anticipate all of the demands that our growth strategy will impose on our business. If we fail to successfully open and operate new company-owned stores and address the increased demands of our growth strategy on our business, our financial performance and growth strategy may be adversely affected.\nThe cost of raw materials, labor or freight could lead to an increase in our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nIncreasing costs for raw materials (due to limited availability or otherwise), labor or freight could make our sourcing processes more costly and negatively affect our gross margin and profitability. Labor costs at many of our independent manufacturers\u2019 sites have been increasing and it is unlikely that these increases will abate. Wage and price inflation in our source countries could cause unanticipated price increases which may be significant. Such price increases by our independent manufacturers could be rapid in the absence of written manufacturing contracts. Energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Rising energy costs may increase our costs of transporting our products for distribution, our utility costs in our offices and company-owned stores and the costs of products that we source from\nindependent suppliers. Further, many of our products are made of materials, such as ballistic nylon, high impact plastics, plastic-injected molded parts and lightweight high tensile strength metals, that are either petroleum-based or require energy to construct and transport. Our independent suppliers and manufacturers may attempt to pass any cost increases on to us, and our relationships with them may be harmed or lost if we refuse to pay such increases, which could lead to product shortages. If we pay such increases, we may not be able to offset them through increases in our pricing and other means, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our targeted gross margins. If we attempt to pass the increases on to consumers, our sales may be adversely affected.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales.\nOur trademarks, copyrights, patents, designs and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and patents. In spite of our efforts, counterfeiting and design copies still occur. If we are unsuccessful in challenging the usurpation of these rights by third parties, this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. Additionally, legal regimes outside the United States, particularly those in Asia, including China, may not always protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as U.S. laws, or the time required to enforce our intellectual property rights under these legal regimes may be lengthy and delay recovery.\nWe face risks associated with operating in international markets.\nWe operate in a global marketplace with approximately 33% of our 2014 net sales from operations outside North America. In addition, international sales growth is a key element of our growth strategy. We are subject to risks associated with our international operations, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\neconomic or governmental instability in foreign markets in which we operate or in those countries from which we source our merchandise;\n\u2022\ndelays or legal uncertainty (including with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights) in countries with less developed legal systems in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of transporting goods globally;\n\u2022\nacts of war, terrorist attacks, outbreaks of contagious disease and other events over which we have no control; and\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, duties, taxes, embargoes, exchange or other government controls.\nAny of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or growth strategy.\nFurthermore, some of our international operations are conducted in parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010), our employees, distributors and wholesalers could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, our results of operations or our financial position.\nWe are exposed to risks from exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe incur substantially all our cost of sales in U.S. dollars, but some of our net sales are collected in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We set the retail prices for our products in foreign countries at periodic intervals. If there is a significant weakening of the exchange rate in the local currency in which our net sales are generated after we set retail prices for our products in that country, our anticipated gross margins would be reduced. Conversely, if there is a significant strengthening of the exchange rate after we set retail prices, the retail prices of our products in that country may be viewed by consumers as comparatively expensive and local demand for our products may decrease until we reset our retail prices for our products in that country. In addition, foreign exchange movements may also negatively affect the relative purchasing power of foreign tourists and result in declines in travel volumes or their willingness to purchase discretionary premium goods, such as our products, while traveling, which would adversely affect our net sales.\nSubstantially all of our purchases from our foreign suppliers are denominated in U.S. dollars. A precipitous or prolonged decline in the value of the U.S. dollar could cause our foreign suppliers to seek price increases on the goods they\nsupply us, which would adversely affect our gross margins if market conditions prevent us from passing those costs on to consumers. We do not currently use the derivative markets to hedge foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from translating certain of our foreign branch offices and subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of local currencies in which we derive significant net sales may impact the U.S. dollar amounts reflected in our financial statements. As a result, these U.S. dollar amounts may obscure underlying financial trends that would be apparent in financial statements prepared on a constant currency basis.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings;\n\u2022\nnet sales and operating profit contributed by new stores;\n\u2022\nchanges in the number of our points of distribution;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in comparable-store sales;\n\u2022\nshifts in the timing of holidays;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions.\nA significant portion of our net revenues and operating cash flows have historically been realized during November and December each year, primarily due to increased retail activity during the holiday seasons, and therefore the fourth quarter factors more significantly into our results for the fiscal year. In 2014, fourth quarter net sales and operating income represented 31% and 40%, respectively, of our annual net sales and operating income. Any disruption in our ability to process, produce and fill customer orders in the fourth quarter could have a negative effect on our quarterly and annual operating results. Additionally, any disruption in our business operations or other factors that could lead to a material shortfall compared with our expectations for the fourth quarter could result in a significant shortfall in net sales and operating cash flows for the full year.\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategy, including our efforts to expand internationally and grow our e-commerce business.\nOur current growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to expand geographically in a number of international regions including Asia, Europe and South America. We plan to enter into additional distribution agreements with our partners to open additional points of distribution. These distribution arrangements are contingent upon our partners\u2019 ability to help expand distribution points and open Tumi free-standing shops in defined territories. If our partners do not perform as we expect we may be required to seek new partners, and the delay this would cause could limit our ability to maintain our growth rate. In addition, we recently expanded into India and Brazil, but barriers to trade, including high tariffs, may depress our earnings potential in those and other markets. Further, the implementation of higher tariffs, quotas or other restrictive trade policies in any international regions in which we operate or seek to operate could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing, or commence new, international operations, which could have an adverse impact on our growth strategy. We have only recently begun to focus and expand our operations in countries in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, and in many of them we face established competitors. Countries in these regions often have different operational characteristics from the regions in which we are more established, including employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements. Further, consumer demand behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our products may not be, or may take time to become, successful, and gross margins on those net sales may not be in line with what we currently experience. Our ability to execute our international growth strategy in countries where we have recently begun to focus our operations, or where we are not yet established, depends on our ability to identify, and maintain successful relationships with, local distribution and wholesale partners that have experience working with premium brands, understand local real estate considerations and appreciate regional market demographics, and we may not be able to identify and agree on terms with, or to successfully maintain relationships with, such partners. In those countries, we also face significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our growth strategy and our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we consider selling our products internationally through a direct sales channel, rather than through distributors. Selling products directly offers certain advantages, such as control over the product selection and brand presentation. However, directly owning such operations requires greater investment of time and resources on our part. There can be no assurance that if we seek to sell our products directly, that we will be successful in securing adequate retail space,\nattract and retain necessary personnel or obtain any required local licenses. In addition, for countries in which we have appointed an exclusive distributor, recapturing these distribution rights may require us to negotiate a transition with our distributor. There can be no assurance that such a transition can be agreed to on terms that would be acceptable to us, or that any such transition, if undertaken, will result in better financial results than had been achieved by us under the prior distribution model.\nIn addition, expansion of our company-owned and partner retail store networks in North America is a key part of our growth strategy. If we are unable to successfully identify and expand our presence in new locations in North America, our growth strategy could be adversely affected. Other important components of our growth strategy include increasing our brand awareness, improving our store operations, and continuing the success of existing products and the successful design and introduction of new products. Our ability to create new products and sustain existing products is in part contingent on our ability to successfully anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences. The failure to increase our brand awareness while retaining our brand\u2019s premium image, to improve our store operations, or to develop and launch new products successfully could adversely affect our growth strategy. Further, we intend to expand our e-commerce business, which may reduce sales through other retail and outlet distribution channels.\nIf we are unable to respond effectively to changes in market trends and consumer preferences, our market share, net sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business in each of the regions in which we operate depends on our ability to identify the key product and market trends in those regions and then to design and bring to market, in a timely manner, products that satisfy the current preferences of a broad range of consumers in each respective region (either by enhancing existing products or by developing new product offerings). Consumer preferences differ across and within each of our operating regions, and shift over time in response to changing aesthetics, means of travel and economic circumstances. We believe that our success in developing innovative products that meet our consumers\u2019 functional needs is an important factor in maintaining and sustaining our image as a premium brand and our ability to charge premium prices. We may not be able to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences in one or more of our operating regions, and, even if we do anticipate and respond to such changes, we may not be able to bring to market in a timely manner enhanced or new products that meet these changing preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences or fail to bring to market, in a timely manner, products that satisfy new preferences, our market share and our net sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to appeal to new consumers while maintaining the loyalty of our core consumers.\nPart of our growth strategy is to introduce new consumers, including younger consumers, to the Tumi brand. If we are unable to attract new consumers, including younger consumers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as our core consumers\u2019 age increases and levels of travel and purchasing frequency decrease. Initiatives and strategies intended to position our brand to appeal to new and younger consumers may not appeal to our core consumers, and may diminish the appeal of our brand to our core consumers, resulting in reduced core consumer loyalty. If we are unable to successfully appeal to new and younger consumers while maintaining our brand\u2019s premium image with our core consumers, our net sales and our brand image may be adversely affected.\nRapid deterioration of our wholesale customer base could erode our profitability.\nOur Indirect-to-Consumer operating segments comprised approximately 49% of our net sales and 54% of our segments\u2019 total operating income in 2014, while our Direct-to-Consumer operating segments comprised approximately 51% of our net sales and 46% of our segments\u2019 total operating income in 2014. Many of our wholesale customers are family-run enterprises that have limited access to capital and undefined succession plans. If these customers reduce or cease operations or close prematurely, we may not be able to replace distribution with our own stores or with other wholesale customers, or we may need to make substantial investments to replace any such lost distribution, and such investments may not be successful. The erosion of our wholesale customer base could have an adverse impact on our cash resources, our gross margins and our overall profitability, adversely impacting our growth plan.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may have a negative effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax provisions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial period may be materially impacted by changes in mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing\naccounting rules or regulations. In addition, tax legislation enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\nIf we are required to write down goodwill or other intangible assets, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, if we determine goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of December 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $142.8 million and other intangible assets of $130.4 million recorded in connection with our acquisition by Doughty Hanson in 2004. Other intangible assets, net consist primarily of brand/trade name, lease value and customer relationships.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involve quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management\u2019s valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our statements of operations and write-downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if management\u2019s conclusions were different. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairment testing.\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to maintain our network of sales and distribution channels or manage our inventory effectively.\nWe employ a multi-channel distribution strategy and make use of a variety of distribution channels, including full-price retail stores, outlet stores, our websites, partner stores, other wholesale distributors such as department stores and third-party e-commerce websites. The effectiveness of our multi-channel strategy depends on our ability to manage our inventory and our distribution processes effectively so as to ensure that our products are available in sufficient quantities at various points of sale and thereby prevent lost sales. If we are not able to maintain our sales and distribution channels, either because of untimely deliveries or otherwise, or if we are not able to effectively manage our inventory, we could experience a decline in net sales, as well as excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. In addition, the failure to deliver our products to certain wholesale distributors in accordance with our delivery schedules could damage our relationship with these distributors and may impair our ability to use the distribution channels provided by such distributors. Consequently, our net sales, profitability and the implementation of our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nWe plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategy and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.\nOur business relies on net cash provided by our operating activities as our primary source of liquidity, and historically all of our growth activities have been funded using operating cash flows. To support our business and execute our growth strategy as planned, we will need to continue to generate significant amounts of cash from operations, including funds to pay our lease obligations, build out new store space, purchase inventory, pay personnel, invest further in our infrastructure and facilities, invest in research and development, and pay for the costs associated with operating as a public company. If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. Conditions in the credit markets (such as availability of finance and fluctuations in interest rates) may make it difficult for us to obtain such financing on attractive terms or even at all. Additional debt financing that we may undertake, including in connection with our credit facility, may be expensive and might impose on us covenants that restrict our operations and strategic initiatives, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, make investments and engage in merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions. Equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing are required, but are unattractive, insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.\nIndebtedness may restrict our current and future operations.\nThe agreement governing our credit facility contains, and our future debt instruments may contain, covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to: grant liens; incur additional debt (including guarantees); pay dividends or distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay or repurchase certain debt; make investments; and consolidate or merge into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person or entity. Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for and react quickly to changing economic, industry and competitive conditions, impair our liquidity and\ncapital resources, and otherwise restrict our business operations. Our ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had no borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility and available credit of $69.7 million. Any future indebtedness could have important consequences to the Company, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, execution of our business strategy and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, including funding future expansion; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because our borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility are expected to be at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates.\nOur extended supply chain requires long lead times and relies heavily on manufacturers in Asia.\nWe rely heavily on manufacturers in Asia which requires long lead times to get goods to markets. The long lead times often require us to carry extra inventory to avoid out-of-stocks. In the event of a decline in demand for our products, due to general economic conditions or other factors, we may be forced to liquidate this extra inventory at low margins or at a loss. In addition, as a result of these long lead times, design decisions are required to be made several months or as early as a year and a half before the goods are delivered. Consumers\u2019 tastes can change between the time a product is designed and the time it takes to get to market. If the designs are not popular with consumers, it could also result in the need to liquidate the inventories at low margins or at a loss, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain the appropriate balance between the autonomy of our regional markets and centralized management.\nOur management strategy is based on giving a high degree of autonomy to our regional management teams in order to ensure that those management teams are in touch with developments in their respective regions. For instance, each of the regions in which we operate requires a different product mix, sales strategy, price point and relationship with distributors and vendors. Additionally, key management functions, including finance, treasury, sourcing initiatives, advertising, legal and coordination of the regions, are managed centrally. We may not always be able to maintain the appropriate balance between regional autonomy and central management. If we favor too much regional autonomy, we risk conflicting or inconsistent brand messages between different regions, which could damage our brand and increase costs. Additionally, if we are unable to maintain sufficient oversight of our partner stores, decisions could be made locally that we regard as not being in our\noverall best interests, which could necessitate the diversion of management resources, result in the inability to capitalize on certain opportunities and/or cause damage to our brand. On the other hand, if we shift too much toward central management, we risk bringing to market products that are not in line with the tastes and preferences of each region, which could negatively affect our market share and net sales in such regions. In either instance, a failure to maintain the appropriate balance between regional autonomy and central management could adversely affect our business, net sales and profitability.\nWe depend on existing members of management and key employees to implement key elements in our strategy for growth, and the failure to retain them or to attract appropriately qualified new personnel could affect our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nThe successful implementation of our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and on our ability to attract appropriately qualified new personnel. For instance, our chief executive officer has extensive experience running branded consumer as well as retail-oriented businesses and our chief financial officer has extensive financial and operational experience in consumer packaged goods, manufacturing and distribution services. The loss of any key member of our management team or other key employees could hinder or delay our ability to implement our growth strategy effectively. Further, if we are unable to attract appropriately qualified new personnel as we expand, we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy. In either instance, our profitability and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition in all of our product lines and markets, and we may not be able to successfully grow or retain market share in key targeted growth markets and product categories.\nWe face intense competition in all of the product lines and markets in which we operate from many competitors who compete with us on an international, regional or local level. Our strategy for future growth relies in part on growth in particular countries as well as in particular product categories, and we expect to continue to face strong competition from both global and regional competitors in all of our key growth markets and product categories. The Tumi brand, which is a key to our ability to\ncompete successfully in our established markets and product categories, has less recognition in many of our targeted growth markets and product categories. We may be unable to establish our brand, or successfully compete once established, in these new markets and product lines. If we fail to compete effectively against our international or regionally focused competitors, we may be unable to expand our market share in our key growth markets or in key product categories, and we may be unable to retain our existing market share in key growth markets or in those markets in which we have traditionally had a strong presence. Failure to protect our market share on a regional level or to grow our market share in key growth markets and product categories could have a material adverse effect on our overall market share and on our net sales and profitability.\nOur warehouse and distribution operations are critical to our success and any disruption from either man-made or natural disasters could negatively impact our operations.\nWe operate three distribution centers in the United States, Germany and Thailand (where we have our third-party logistics facility), all of which are critical to our ability to distribute our products on a timely basis. Damage or disruption to any of these warehouse locations could adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products and thereby have a deleterious effect on our financial results. For example, in the past, our distribution facility in Thailand was impacted by flooding due to severe weather in that area and our German warehouse was impacted by severe winter weather. In both cases our ability to operate was mitigated by the availability of our Vidalia, Georgia facility, which serves as a master distribution facility and is critical to our continued operations. If the Vidalia facility were to experience a disruption of service, our financial results and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nWe typically do not employ traditional advertising channels, and if we fail to adequately market our brand through product introductions and other means of promotion, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn 2014, we spent approximately 3% of our net sales on advertising and promotion expenses. Our marketing strategy depends on our ability to promote our brand\u2019s message by using store window campaigns, product placements in editorial sections, social media to promote new product introductions in a cost effective manner, the use of catalog mailings and, from time to time, the use of newspapers and magazines. We typically do not employ traditional advertising channels such as billboards, television and radio. If our marketing efforts are not successful at attracting new consumers and increasing purchasing frequency by our existing consumers, there may be no cost-effective marketing channels available to us for the promotion of our brand. If we increase our spending on advertising, or initiate spending on traditional advertising, our expenses will rise, and our advertising efforts may not be successful. In addition, if we are unable to successfully and cost-effectively employ advertising channels to promote our brand to new consumers and new markets, our growth strategy may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.\nWe lease substantially all our facilities and company-owned store locations and lease-related expense is a significant component of our operating expenses, accounting for $35.9 million in 2014. We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of up to ten years. We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in the past due in part to the state of the economy; however, in an improving commercial real estate market, we expect rates to increase upon renewal in the near term. Many of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards. In addition to future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance and real estate taxes. Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions. As we grow our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations (including rent deposits), thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing.\nAny of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors. We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these lease expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.\nAdditional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancellable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms. In the past five years, we have closed 12 stores. If an existing or future store is not profitable and we decide to close it, then we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease. Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.\nCertain legal proceedings, regulatory matters and accounting changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject, from time to time, to various claims arising out of our business operations, which may include or relate to alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters and other actions. Additionally, we may from time to time be subject to new or revised laws, regulations and regulatory actions both in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur involvement in any legal proceeding or regulatory matter would cause us to incur legal and other costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws or regulations, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs, perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of eventual costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to customer relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources.\nIn addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, is currently in the process of amending a number of existing accounting standards governing a variety of areas. Certain of these proposed standards, particularly the proposed standard governing accounting for leases, if and when effective, would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nFailure to protect confidential information of our consumers and our network against security breaches or failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could damage our reputation, brand and business.\nOur e-commerce websites and our company-owned stores are currently a source of Direct-to-Consumer sales, and serve as a marketing tool for the Tumi brand. A significant challenge to Direct-to-Consumer sales and communications, including the operation of our websites, is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations. On our websites, a majority of the sales are billed to our consumers\u2019 credit card accounts directly, orders are shipped to a consumer\u2019s address, and consumers log on using their email address. In such transactions, maintaining complete security for the transmission of confidential information on our websites, such as consumers\u2019 credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, is essential to maintaining consumer confidence. In addition, we hold certain private information about our consumers, such as their names, addresses, phone numbers and browsing and purchasing records.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect the secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect consumer transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user\u2019s password could potentially access the user\u2019s transaction data or personal information. We may not be able to prevent third parties, such as hackers or criminal organizations, from stealing information provided by our consumers to us through our websites or otherwise. In addition, our third-party merchants and delivery service providers may violate their confidentiality obligations and disclose information about our consumers. Any compromise of our security or material violation of a non-disclosure obligation could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which would substantially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations.\nWe may have technical problems with information technology systems, particularly our ordering and inventory management systems, on which we rely to manage our business efficiently and effectively.\nAs a global, multi-channel business, we rely on a number of information technology systems in order to manage our business efficiently and effectively. We use the SAP Enterprise Resource Planning system across all of our North American, European and Asian operations to manage inventory and sourcing effectively. Logistical problems, such as technical faults with ordering systems or the failure to manage inventory effectively, may result in delays in delivery that could result in fines from\ncertain wholesale customers, or lost sales, which if material or substantial over a period of time, may adversely affect our net sales and damage our reputation.\nReplacements of our core information technology platforms may prove disruptive.\nAs a result of rapid growth in the number of our store locations and complexity of our business, we have been reviewing the adequacy of certain core information technology platforms used to run our business. While we believe that our main enterprise resource planning system is robust enough to support our business requirements for the foreseeable future, other systems may need to be substantially upgraded or replaced. In the future, it may be necessary to replace or upgrade core information technology platforms such as our enterprise resource planning platform or store point-of-sale system, our inventory forecasting and replenishment system, our state tax reporting system and our web-based sales system, among others. Unanticipated costs and unsuccessful execution of these upgrades may, among other things, disrupt our ability to effectively manage inventory and sourcing and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReplacement and upgrade of our e-commerce platform to a new platform may encounter difficulties or delays.\nDuring 2014, we transitioned our North American web services to an internally managed model. In 2015 we plan to insource our international websites and expand into more European countries. As part of this initiative, we are replacing and upgrading our e-commerce platform. Unanticipated difficulties and costs related to this project, or unsuccessful or delayed execution of the project, may disrupt our operations, reduce customer satisfaction with their online experience, damage our brand and reputation or have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnion attempts to organize our employees could negatively affect our business.\nNone of our employees are currently represented by a union or workers\u2019 council. As we grow our business and enter different regions, unions may attempt to organize all or a portion of our employee base at certain of our owned stores and other facilities, or within certain regions. These efforts could result in work stoppages or other disruptions and could cause management to divert time and resources from other aspects of our business.\nWe may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.\nIn March 2010, the federal government enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together with the PPACA, the \u201cHealthcare Reform Laws\u201d), and the constitutionality of the PPACA was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2012. The Healthcare Reform Laws will increase the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer healthcare benefits to their employees and will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization. The changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs. Additionally, many provisions of the Healthcare Reform Laws did not go into effect immediately and may be subject to further clarification through future regulation. Therefore, the ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the Healthcare Reform Laws become available.\nCompliance with government regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may result in increased costs and risks to the Company.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cAct\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. We will have to publicly disclose whether we manufacture (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act. Additionally, customers typically rely on us to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products we sell. We have many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all. Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products. Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our common stock could continue to be subject to potential significant fluctuations in response to the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, particularly during holiday shopping periods;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors, or differences between our actual results and those expected by investors and securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to our, or our competitors\u2019, filings with the SEC or announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic investments, litigation, restructurings or other significant matters;\n\u2022\nspeculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nactions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry.\nIn addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue a sell recommendation or other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, our stock price could decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes and do not anticipate paying cash dividends. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under the agreement governing our amended credit facility and any other agreements governing indebtedness we may incur, and will depend on, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. As a result, you should expect to receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of the stock increases, which may never occur.\nDoughty Hanson may exert influence over us and our significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Doughty Hanson owned approximately 13.4% of our outstanding common stock and controlled approximately 13.4% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. For so long as Doughty Hanson owns a significant portion of our common stock, Doughty Hanson will be able to exert significant voting influence over us and our significant corporate decisions.\nWe are a party to a director nomination agreement that grants certain Doughty Hanson entities the right to designate nominees to our board of directors provided certain ownership requirements are met. Currently one Doughty Hanson nominee is serving on our board of directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that Doughty Hanson has no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nDoughty Hanson and the member(s) of our board of directors who are affiliated with Doughty Hanson, by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors. We, by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, expressly renounce any interest in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law, even if the opportunity is one that we would reasonably be deemed to have pursued if given the opportunity to do so. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation cannot be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment. Doughty Hanson is in the business of making investments in portfolio companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us. Doughty Hanson has no obligation to refrain from acquiring competing businesses. Any competition could intensify if an affiliate or subsidiary of Doughty Hanson were to enter into or acquire a business similar to ours.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. In addition, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register 6,786,667 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the 2012 Plan (of which 2,200 shares have been issued). As a result, any shares or other equity awards issued under the 2012 Plan, subject to any vesting requirements, will be freely tradable in the public market.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include, among others: a classified board of directors; a prohibition on the ability of stockholders to remove directors without cause; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; a prohibition on the ability of stockholders generally to call special meetings; the inability of stockholders generally to act by written consent; the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval; and the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 13367, "SIC": 3100, "TIC": "TUMI"}
