RISK FACTORS\nOUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES.\nWe have experienced losses in the past and expect to experience losses in the future.\nWe have incurred substantial operating and net losses in the past, including in 2015, and we expect to continue to incur losses in 2016. If economic conditions worsen, or there is an abrupt change in our customers\u2019 businesses or markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and our end markets our results of operations can vary significantly which could have a material and adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry and our end markets have been cyclical, seasonal and subject to significant downturns. Further, the industry can have limited visibility into customers\u2019 forecasts and inventory levels. In past years, particularly within the mobile market, the industry has experienced periods marked by market weaknesses that created lower order demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels, and accelerated declines in average selling prices for our products.\nOur results of operations also may be subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others: (i) changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured with our products and sold by our customers; (ii) the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products; (iii) industry production capacity levels and fluctuations in industry manufacturing yields; (iv) levels of inventory in our end markets; (v) availability and cost of products from our suppliers; (vi) the gain or loss of significant customers; (vii) our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis; (viii) new product and technology introductions by competitors; (ix) changes in the mix of products produced and sold; (x) market acceptance of our products and our customers; and (xi) intellectual property disputes.\nThese factors negatively affected our business, financial condition and results of operations during these periods and may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe depend on a few large customers for a significant portion of our revenue; a loss of a significant customer or a decrease in purchases and/or changes in purchasing or payment patterns by one of these customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our ability to forecast revenues.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from a few significant customers and their subcontractors. Our financial condition and results of operations have been materially and adversely affected in the past by the failure of anticipated orders to be realized and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements. If a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customer\u2019s ability to make timely payments to us for non-returnable products could be impaired. If we were to lose any of our major customers, if sales to these customers were to decrease materially or our customers fail to make timely payments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to sell a sufficient volume of products relative to our manufacturing capacity and facility utilization, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nSince June 2014, we have decreased capacity in our manufacturing facility; however, our manufacturing facility continues to be underutilized. In years in which we had excess capacity, this excess capacity meant we incurred higher fixed costs for our products relative to the revenues we generated. Because significant portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, our manufacturing volumes are critical to our operating results. If we fail to achieve and maintain acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience customer-driven product shipment delays, our results of operations could be harmed. During periods of decreased demand, our fixed manufacturing costs negatively affect our results of operations. If we are unable to improve utilization levels and manage capacity, the increased expense levels relative to revenue will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future orders and these expense levels are predominantly fixed. If we receive fewer customer orders than expected or if our customers delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, which could result in a decrease in our products\u2019 prices and sales.\nThe markets for our semiconductor products are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductor and IC manufacturers of various sizes, some of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our markets involve substantial competition and we expect that competitive pressures will remain high. Particularly in mobile markets, this competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share. We believe that the principal competitive factors for suppliers in our markets include, among others: (i) time-to-market; (ii) timely new product innovation; (iii) product quality, reliability and performance; (iv) product price; (v) features available in products; (vi) compliance with industry standards; (vii) strategic relationships with leading reference design providers and customers; (viii) access to and protection of intellectual property; (ix) market acceptance; and (x) maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost.\nCertain of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nCurrent and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, distributors, reference design providers or other third parties with whom we have or may in the future have relationships. If our competitors are able to strengthen existing, or establish new, relationships with these third parties they may rapidly acquire market share at our expense, which has occurred in the past when our capacity was constrained and we were unable to fully meet customer demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Further, increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe need to keep pace with rapid product and process development and technological changes as well as product cost reductions to be competitive.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies based on the continuous demand for product enhancements, including greater performance, higher levels of integration, and smaller form factors. Particularly within the mobile markets, because the continuous evolution of these technologies and frequent introduction of new products and enhancements have generally resulted in short product life cycles for products, we believe that our future success in that market will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to improve the efficiency of our products and process technologies and rapidly develop new products and process technologies. The successful development of our products is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors, and our ability to protect, develop or otherwise obtain adequate intellectual property for our new products. The development and/or implementation of new and emerging technology may require us to modify the manufacturing process for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products, which may prove difficult for us and result in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may need to make substantial investments to develop these enhancements and technologies, and we cannot assure you that we will have funds available for these investments or that these enhancements and technologies will be successful. Although we have reduced product costs through cost negotiation and reduction, improved yields, packaging and test applications and die size reduction, we may not be able to do so in the future. We must achieve yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products, and introduce new products that can be manufactured at lower costs. If a new technology emerges that is, or is perceived to be, superior to our existing technology and we are unable to develop and/or implement the new technology successfully or to develop and implement a competitive and economically acceptable alternative technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInvestments in researching and developing emerging technologies may not result in returns on such investments and may pose risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for semiconductors products is ever evolving and demands us to be innovative and forward-looking. To remain competitive and profitable, we need to identify emerging technologies and invest in research and development of products which utilize such emerging technologies. There can be no assurance that we will have visibility into emerging technologies or sufficient resources to research and develop products incorporating such emerging technologies. Even if we are successful, we may not sell any such new products and therefore fail to achieve any return on our investment in the research and development of such new products. Further, there may be potential risks associated with the development and commercialization of new products, including unforeseen health risks or regulatory actions. If we fail to identify emerging technologies, research and develop new products and/or experience unforeseen hazards relating to such development, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to expand our market share within the infrastructure market our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently expect a larger portion of our revenue to derive from infrastructure markets. However, delays in the development of new technologies used in infrastructure applications or in the advancement of technologies used in infrastructure applications could reduce purchases of our products by manufacturers in these markets and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nWithin the infrastructure market, our future success depends on the continued advancement of the communications industry and, in particular, the continued expansion of global information networks, especially those directly or indirectly dependent upon CATV infrastructure.\nWe rely on increasing demand for voice, video and other data delivered over high-bandwidth network systems as well as commitments by network systems vendors to invest in the expansion of the global information network. As network usage and bandwidth demand increase, so does the need for advanced wired CATV subsystems and components. Therefore, our future growth as a manufacturer of these products is dependent on the expansion in these networks. In the event that global information networks do not grow as expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect a significant portion of our profitability in future periods to derive from the demand for DOCSIS3.1. The transition from DOCSIS3.0 to DOCSIS3.1 has begun to take hold in Europe. The transition is expected to occur in the United States in 2016, with demand for CATV infrastructure products anticipated to increase in 2016. If the transition from DOCSIS3.0 to DOCSIS3.1 does not take place or is substantially delayed in either Europe or the United States, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have implemented cost restructuring programs in the past and may need to again in the future.\nWe implemented cost restructuring programs in each of the past three years and may need to implement such programs again in the future. Such restructuring programs are costly to implement and may inadequately address the operating environment. No assurance can be given that the implementation of cost reduction programs will generate the anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that future or additional measures may be required. If we incorrectly anticipate the extent and term of a market decline or weak demand for our products and services, we may be forced to restructure further or may incur future operating charges due to poor business conditions and our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nShort product life cycles, particularly within the mobile markets, and the nature of semiconductor production, including the potential for order cancellation and need to build product to a customer\u2019s forecast may leave us with obsolete or excess inventories.\nThe life cycles of some of our products, particularly within the mobile market, depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed. Products with short life cycles require us to manage production and inventory levels closely. We are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because in certain cases we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products. As a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales. Unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products and/or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed can result in obsolete or excess inventories, requiring a write off or a reduction in the inventory value. Such charges could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf equipment manufacturers and designers of infrastructure and mobile communications products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products.\nOur products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on equipment manufacturers and designers of infrastructure and mobile communications products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these \u201cdesign wins,\u201d we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier\u2019s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. We may not continue to achieve design wins, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.\nAchieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, including for example, if its own products are not commercially successful. Failure to convert design wins into actual sales could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.\nAfter our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need several quarters to integrate, test and evaluate our product and several additional quarters to begin volume production of their device that incorporates our product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business.\nOur sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have certain rights to return unsold products. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to equipment manufacturers or designers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs. In addition, shortened customer order lead times and opportunistic orders may not be filled timely due to a lack of, or inadequate level of uncommitted inventory resulting in lower revenues than possible. Further, shortened customer order lead times may make it difficult to forecast revenues. Each of these uncertainties relating to the ordering and shipment of our products could result in a material and adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes and the processes of our subcontractors.\nThe fabrication of ICs, particularly those made of GaAs, is a highly complex and precise process. Our ICs are primarily manufactured on wafers made of GaAs requiring multiple process steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, downtime on equipment, human error, interruptions in electrical supply, among other factors can cause a substantial interruption in our manufacturing processes. Moreover, our manufacturing process is subject to fluctuations in our demand and fab utilization. In order to satisfy increasing customer demand by significantly increasing manufacturing output and adding personnel, we may also incur manufacturing disruptions limiting supply to customers.\nAdditionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at our production facility or those of our subcontractors. Due to the highly specialized nature of the GaAs IC manufacturing process, in the event of a disruption at the Warren, New Jersey semiconductor wafer fab, alternative GaAs production capacity for certain processes would not be readily available from third-party sources. Disruptions may include electrical power outages, fire, earthquakes, flooding, international conflicts, war, acts of terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in our shipments unless and until we are able to shift the manufacturing of such products from an affected facility to another facility or the disruption is remedied.\nMany of our customers require that they qualify a new manufacturing source before they will accept products from such source. This qualification process may be expensive and time consuming. In the event of such delays, we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative manufacturing capacity or assembly and test capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing. In the event we are unable to supply our customers with products on a timely basis, such customers may seek alternative suppliers.\nIf we experience disruptions or failures in our manufacturing processes or the processes of our subcontractors, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to meet customer quality, performance and reliability standards.\nOur customers specify quality, performance and reliability standards that we must meet. If our products do not meet these standards, we may be required to rework or replace the products. Our products may contain undetected defects or failures that only become evident after we commence volume shipments, which we may experience from time to time. Other defects or failures may also occur in the future. If such failures or defects occur, we could: (i) lose revenues; (ii) incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support; (iii) experience delays, cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products; (iv) experience increased product returns or discounts; or (v) damage our reputation which could make it difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers. We also depend on certain vendors for components, equipment and services. We maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors. However, these vendors\u2019 processes may vary in reliability or quality, which could negatively affect our products. If we fail to meet customer standards for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur dependence on external semiconductor component suppliers, assembly and test operations subcontractors could lead to delays in or reductions of product shipments.\nOur products contain numerous component parts, substrates, GaAs, GaN and silicon-based products, obtained from external suppliers. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity constraints, manufacturing yields, quality, fabrication costs, warranty issues and protection of intellectual property. We do not assemble or test all of our ICs or multi-chip modules. Instead, we provide the IC die and, in some cases, packaging and other components to assemble and test to external subcontractors, located primarily in Asia. If these vendors\u2019 processes vary in reliability or quality, they could negatively affect our products. If we are unable to obtain sufficient high quality and timely component parts, assembly or test service, if we experience delays in transferring or requalifying our production between suppliers, assembly or test locations or if means of transportation to or from these locations are interrupted, we would experience increased costs, delays or reductions in product shipment, and/or reduced product yields, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSources for certain components, materials, equipment and repair services are limited, which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments.\nWe do not manufacture any of the starting epitaxial wafers, packaging or passive components used in the production of our GaAs ICs. Such wafers, packaging and passive components are available from a limited number of sources. To the extent that we or our subcontractors are unable to obtain these wafers, packaging or passive components in the required quantities, as has occurred from time to time in the past, we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of vendors to supply, service, maintain, and repair the equipment used in our manufacturing processes. Should timely repair services be unavailable, we could experience substantial delays in production. When demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is high, lead times for delivery of such equipment can be substantial. We cannot assure you that we would not lose potential sales if required manufacturing equipment is unavailable and, as a result, we are unable to maintain or increase our production levels. A delay for any reason in increasing capacity would limit our ability to increase sales volumes, which would harm our relationships with customers and our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nThe variability of our manufacturing yields may affect our gross margins.\nOur manufacturing yields vary significantly among products, depending on the complexity of a particular IC\u2019s design and our experience in manufacturing that type of IC. We have experienced difficulties in achieving planned yields in the past, particularly in pre-production and upon initial commencement of full production volumes, which have adversely affected our gross margins.\nRegardless of the process technology used, the fabrication of ICs is a highly complex and precise process. Problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ICs on each wafer to be nonfunctional, thereby reducing yields. These difficulties can include: (i) defects in masks, which are used to transfer circuit patterns onto our wafers; (ii) impurities in the materials used; (iii) operator errors; (iv) contamination of the manufacturing environment; (v) equipment failure; and (vi) interruptions in electrical supply.\nMany of our manufacturing costs are fixed and average selling prices for our products are unlikely to rise, and may decline over time. Therefore, it is critical for us, particularly within mobile markets, to increase the number of shippable ICs per wafer and increase the production volume of wafers in order to maintain or improve our results of operations. Yield decreases can result in substantially higher unit costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and have done so in the past. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer periodic yield problems, particularly during the early production of new products or introduction of new process technologies. If any new yield problems were to arise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in individual or world markets could negatively impact our financial performance.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could result in lower demand for some of our products, longer sales cycles or increased price competition. Our customer base includes equipment manufacturers and designers that are reliant on consumer demand, particularly in mobile markets. In times of economic downturn, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending, which could soften demand for our customers\u2019 products and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur GaAs semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.\nWithin our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell GaAs semiconductor devices and components, which tend to be more expensive than their silicon counterparts. The cost differential between our devices and components and those that are silicon based is due to higher costs of raw materials and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. We expect the cost of producing GaAs devices to continue to exceed the cost of producing their silicon counterparts for the foreseeable future. In addition, silicon semiconductor technologies are widely-used process technologies for certain ICs and these technologies continue to improve in performance. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer GaAs products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts. If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify their higher cost, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, we cannot assure you that there will continue to be products and markets that require the performance attributes of GaAs solutions and if demand for such products or in such markets were to decline our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or in avoiding claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and copyrights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized third parties may violate our patents or copyrights. In addition to intellectual property that we have patented and copyrighted, we also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and other non-patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities, which we seek to protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and employees. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by others.\nWe seek to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have been notified, and may be notified in the future, that we may be infringing on certain patents and/or other intellectual property rights of other parties. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to litigation to defend our products or processes against claims of patent infringement or other intellectual property claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. If we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms and we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and cease production of our work product or use of one or more manufacturing processes. Even if we are ultimately successful, patent litigation can be time consuming, disruptive to management and expensive. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.\nHistorically, we have operated at a loss and have not consistently generated sufficient cash from operations to cover our operating and other cash expenses. In mid-2014, we implemented a strategic restructuring plan that we believed would place increased emphasis on infrastructure markets, lower operating costs and position the business for improved operating results. By the three months ended April 4, 2015 our infrastructure revenue improved, costs were lowered and operating losses were reduced in keeping with the strategic restructuring plan. However, subsequent to that date, unexpected declines in revenues resulted in an increase in operating losses. Therefore, the delayed improvement in infrastructure revenue is forecasted to result in operating losses into 2016, larger than those foreseen under the strategic restructuring plan. Additionally, in future periods, we did not maintain compliance with certain covenants under its revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB Loan Agreement) which resulted in repayment of outstanding borrowings, the termination of the SVB Loan Agreement, and the establishment of a credit facility with II-VI Incorporated, in conjunction with the Merger Agreement (as defined below). The combination of these factors raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in 2016. During 2015, we explored potential avenues for raising capital through debt or equity, but the limited options that were available would have required us to accept unfavorable terms that were costly and highly dilutive to the Company's stockholders. Our operating losses, declining cash balance and corresponding need for funding were among the key reasons that the our Board of Directors decided to explore the possible sale of the Company in conjunction with its plans to overcome these difficulties. On January 15, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger that was amended on February 1, 2016 and February 26, 2016 (as so amended, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with II-VI Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\u201cII-VI\u201d), and Regulus Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of II-VI (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d). In conjunction with the Merger Agreement, we were able to obtain a loan from II-VI to address our deteriorating liquidity position. There can be no assurance that a transaction will be consummated or that II-VI will not propose any adjustments to the Merger Agreement. In the event that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated, we will continue to aggressively pursue available sales opportunities, work with distributors and end users to grow future sales, and continue to control costs. The ability to continue as a going concern in 2016 is dependent upon increasing infrastructure revenue, continuing to control costs to meet obligations and repay liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. If we are unable to execute our operating plan, increase our infrastructure revenue, continue to control costs and raise additional capital, we will not have adequate capital to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for the next twelve months.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel and the loss of a key executive could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nA small number of key executive officers manage our business. Their departure could have a material and adverse effect on our operations. We believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, technical sales and marketing personnel, design and application engineers, as well as senior management. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry as the wired and wireless communications markets continue to evolve. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in retaining our key personnel or in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, especially during periods of poor operating performance and/or weak performance of our common stock. Further, we do not presently maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material effect on our ability to operate our business, to implement our business strategy and to respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may pursue selective investments, acquisitions and alliances; the management and integration of additional operations could be expensive and divert management time; and acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.\nAlthough we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. Our ability to complete acquisitions or alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited to, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including the management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions and difficulties in integrating and managing the additional operations and personnel of acquired companies.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the capital necessary to consummate acquisitions or alliances on satisfactory terms, if at all. Further, any businesses that we acquire will likely have their own capital needs, which may be significant, and which we could be called upon to satisfy independent of the acquisition price. Future acquisitions or alliances could result in the incurrence of debt, costs and contingent liabilities which could subject us to substantial and burdensome covenants, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe growth that may result from future acquisitions or alliances may place significant strains on our resources, systems and management. If we are unable to effectively manage such growth by implementing systems, expanding our infrastructure and hiring, training and managing employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFinally, if we issue equity securities in order to acquire another business, our stockholders\u2019 interest in us, or the combined company, could be materially diluted. Further, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for our common stock and the volume of trading in such stock could be adversely affected if the stock is delisted from the NASDAQ exchange.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market. We transferred our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market effective December 17, 2015.\nOn June 18, 2015, we received a letter from the staff of NASDAQ informing us that for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below $1.00, a requirement for listing on NASDAQ. We had until December 15, 2015 to regain compliance which would be satisfied if our common stock closed at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. By transferring our common stock listing from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market, we received an additional 180 calendar compliance days, or until June 13, 2016, to regain compliance.\nIf we do not regain compliance by June 13, 2016, and the NASDAQ staff could deem that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, the NASDAQ staff would notify us that our securities would then be subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, we may appeal the NASDAQ staff\u2019s determination to delist our securities. Should this occur, the market for our common stock and the volume of trading in such stock could be adversely affected.\nBecause our results of operations can vary significantly, the price of our common stock can fluctuate.\nAs a result of the variability of our results of operation, we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results. Investors should not rely on our results of operations for any previous period as an indicator of what results may be for any future period. Failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of analysts or investors could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe have had significant volatility in our stock price which may continue in the future, and, therefore, you may be unable to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including: (i) our operating results and prospects; (ii) the operating results and prospects of our major customers; (iii) announcements by our competitors; (iv) the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock; (v) investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate; (vi) changes in our earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts covering our stock; (vii) general financial and other market conditions; and (viii) domestic and international economic conditions.\nFurther, public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in the technology sectors of the market. This volatility disproportionately affected and may in the future affect the market prices of securities of many technology companies, including our Company, for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our valuation multiples may have made our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Such market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Stockholders may be unable to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price paid for such shares.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations both domestically and abroad.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include those related to the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in or resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to substantial liability or force us to significantly change our manufacturing operations. In addition, under some of these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. Although we are aware of contamination resulting from historical third-party operations at one of our facilities, a prior owner of such facility has been performing and paying for the costs associated with remediation of this property pursuant to an agreement with the State of New Jersey environmental regulatory authority. However, we cannot assure you that such prior owner will continue to do so or that we will not incur any material costs or liabilities associated with compliance with environmental laws in the future. In the event that the prior owner fails to execute the remediation or that we incur material costs or liabilities resulting from compliance with these laws, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompliance with regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nRegulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products. We have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and of Delaware law could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and that could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Together, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws, and certain provisions of Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and could also limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81539, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ANAD"}
