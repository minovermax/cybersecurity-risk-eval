RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company involves risk, some of which, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic risks, could be substantial and is inherent in the Company\u2019s business. This risk also includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease considerably, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below are risk factors that could adversely affect financial results and condition, as well as the value of, and return on investments made in the Company. Although the Company believes that these risks are the most important for you to consider, you should read this section in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to those Financial Statements and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit Risks\nDeterioration in local economies or real estate market may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance, as its borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans may decline.\nThe Company serves individuals and businesses located in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in these areas and the value of the associated collateral is subject to local real estate market conditions. Furthermore, many customers in the hospitality industry rely upon a high number of tourists to vacation destinations and attractions within the Company\u2019s markets. The Company\u2019s success is largely dependent on the economic conditions, including employment levels, population growth, income levels, savings trends and government policies in those market areas. A downturn in the local economies may adversely affect collateral values, sources of funds, and demand for products, all of which could have a negative impact on results of operations, financial condition and business expansion.\nHigh concentrations of commercial loans may increase exposure to credit loss upon borrower default.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 60% of the Banks\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans. Commercial loan portfolio concentration generally exposes lenders to greater risk of delinquency and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income streams from the property. Commercial loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers as compared to residential real estate loans. As the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of large commercial loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans, provision for loan losses, and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of business, the Bank may own or foreclose and take title to real estate that may be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to subject property. As a result, the Company may be held liable for property damage, personal injury, investigation and restoration costs. The cost associated with investigation or restoration activities could be\nsubstantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, the Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nGreater than anticipated credit losses in the loan portfolios may adversely affect earnings.\nCredit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on operating results. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a periodic basis using current information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans. Although the Company believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. Increases in the allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing reported net income.\nAs further discussed in Note 1- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, the Company has adopted Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 326 or \u201cCECL\u201d effective January 1, 2021.\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Risks\nInterest rate volatility could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-bearing assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, demand for loans, securities and deposits, policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, or the slope of the yield curve could influence not only the interest received on loans and securities and the amount of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of loans and securities that are collateralized by mortgages. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. If interest rates decline, the Bank\u2019s higher- rate loans and investments may be subject to prepayment risk, which could negatively impact its net interest margin. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the Bank\u2019s loans and investment securities may be subject to extension risk, which could negatively impact its net interest margin as well.\nWholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits, support operations and future growth.\nThe Company and banking subsidiaries must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of customers. To manage liquidity, the Company draws upon a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth, loan repayments and maturities of loans and securities. These sources include FHLB and FRB advances, proceeds from the sale of securities and loans and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company\u2019s ability to manage liquidity will be severely constrained if unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. In addition, if the Company is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the cost of funding.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase if deposits are lost and are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if customers shift their deposits into higher cost products or if the Company needs to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nThe Company\u2019s access to funds from subsidiaries may be restricted.\nBar Harbor Bankshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank and non-banking subsidiaries. Bar Harbor Bankshares depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its banking and non-banking subsidiaries to fund\ndividend payments on its common stock, debt service of subordinated borrowings, fund stock repurchase program and to fund strategic initiatives or other obligations. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Bar Harbor Bankshares based on assertion that certain payments from subsidiaries are considered an unsafe or unsound practice.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business. Generally, customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time.\nThe speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within the customers\u2019 discretion. Fluctuations in interest rates, in certain circumstances, may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments, which may also have an adverse impact on net interest income. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and the Company is unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition.\nSecondary mortgage market conditions may adversely affect financial condition and earnings.\nThe secondary mortgage markets are impacted by interest rates and investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce the Company\u2019s loan production volumes, change loan portfolio composition, and reduce operating results. Secondary markets are affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginny Mae (collectively, the \"Agencies\") for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. These agencies could limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, changes in conforming loan criteria or other factors. Proposals to reform mortgage finance could affect the role of the Agencies and the market for conforming loans.\nReforms to London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other indices, and related uncertainty, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company established a committee in 2020 comprised of bank management to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR. The Company has determined that its financial products tied to LIBOR will not be subject to cessation until June 30, 2023. This review also identified that only a few legacy contracts do not include appropriate fallback language. The Company anticipates that the appropriate fallback provisions for these contracts will be implemented and allow for an orderly transition prior to the June 30, 2023 cessation of U.S. Dollar LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, the Company no longer issues new LIBOR-based financial instruments. Furthermore, U.S. Dollar LIBOR indices utilized by Company\u2019s existing financial instruments shall cease on June 30, 2023. Beginning January 1, 2022, the Company is using the CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the primary index for financial instruments and the Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) as a secondary index.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. If personal, non-public, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in the Company\u2019s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and its large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (i.e., computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disaster, pandemics, or other damage to property or physical assets), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual\nobligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees) and to the risk that the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate (i.e., by requiring the Company to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information systems and security breaches may adversely affect its business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on electronic communications and information systems to conduct its businesses and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding its customers. The integrity of information systems are under significant threat from cyberattacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. The Company employs an in-depth, layered, defense approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. Notwithstanding the strength of defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Cybersecurity risks may also occur with the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with additional potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. The Company offers its customers the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology-based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, its network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities or the activities of its clients or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose the Company to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nWhile to date the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, the Company\u2019s systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers, are under constant threat and may experience a significant event in the future. The Company may suffer material financial losses related to these risks or be subject to liability for compromises to its customers or third-party providers. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations, and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of client business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation, and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are reliant on outside vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for its day-to-day operations. Vendors may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in their agreements for any number of reasons including a change in the vendor\u2019s senior management, financial condition, product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or simply change their strategic focus putting the Company at risk. While the Company has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk in all phases of vendor management from selection to performance monitoring, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Bank and non-bank financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. The Company has exposure to different industries and counterparties through transactions with counterparties in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more bank or non-bank financial services companies, or the bank or non-bank financial services industries generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the federal, state, or local tax laws may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law that could increase effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect the Company\u2019s current and future financial performance. Legislation enacted in 2017 resulted in a reduction in the Company\u2019s federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, which had a favorable impact on earnings and capital generation abilities. During 2021, Congress debated various proposals for increase in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases as part of the funding for various spending initiatives. Any such increase in the corporate tax rate or surcharges would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in future periods.\nImpairment of investment securities or goodwill could result in a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn assessing whether the impairment of securities is related to a deterioration in credit factors, the Company considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in the Company\u2019s stock price or occurrence of a triggering event following any of its quarterly earnings releases and prior to the filing of the periodic report for that period could, under certain circumstances, require performance of a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period which was not reflected in such earnings release. During 2021, the annual impairment test conducted in October, using discounted cash flows and market based approaches, indicated that the estimated fair value of its sole reporting unit \u201cBar Harbor Bank & Trust\u201d exceeded the carrying value. In a future assessments, the Company could conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings.\nRevenues from the Company\u2019s wealth management companies are significant to its earnings.\nRevenues from the Company\u2019s wealth management business are significant to our earnings. Generating returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Administering or managing assets in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction. Failure in either of the foregoing areas can expose the Company to liability, and result in a decrease in revenues and earnings.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on the Company\u2019s customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on the Company\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company\u2019s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business and the business of its customers.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. In particular, such events may have a particularly negative impact upon the business of customers who are engaged in the hospitality in the Company\u2019s market area, which could have a direct negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nStrategic and External Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business and financial results, as it is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created extensive disruptions to the economy and to the lives of individuals. Governments, businesses, and the public are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. While the scope, duration, and full effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in our Form 10-K could be exacerbated and such effects could have an adverse impact on the Company in a number of ways related to credit quality, collateral values, customer demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk, and human capital.\nChanges in the general economy or the financial markets could adversely affect financial performance.\nA deterioration of general economic conditions could adversely affect local economies and have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. Deterioration or defaults made by issuers of the underlying collateral of investment securities may cause additional credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charges to the income statement. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies or deteriorating investor expectations.\nMonetary policy and economic environment could impact financial performance.\nThe earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates, thereby affecting the strength of the economy, the level of inflation, or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company\u2019s business and earnings.\nStrong competition within the Company\u2019s markets may significantly impact profitability.\nThe Company competes with an ever-increasing array of financial service providers. See the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d of Item 1 of this report for additional competitor information. Competition from nationwide banks, as well as local institutions, continues to mount in the Company\u2019s markets. To compete, the Company focuses on quality customer service, making decisions at the local level, maintaining long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of customers. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Company\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect growth and profitability.\nMarket changes may adversely affect demand for services and impact revenue, costs, and earnings.\nChannels for servicing the Company\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, increased use of e-commerce channels, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. The Company has an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges\nand introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. The Company competes with larger financial institutions who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.\nExpansion, growth, and acquisitions could negatively impact earnings if not successful.\nThe Company may grow organically both by geographic expansion and through business line expansion, as well as through acquisitions. Success of these activities depends on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Success may also depends on acceptance of the Bank by customers in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, these factors include the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. Profitability depends on whether the marginal revenue generated in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity, with more staff, more locations, and more product offerings. Failure to achieve any of these success factors may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by continuous technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies.\nThe introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources. The Company\u2019s failure to manage risks and uncertainties associated with new products and services exposes it to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to the Company\u2019s clients. Products and services relying on internet and mobile technologies may expose the Company to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with the ability to conduct business and may negatively impact financial results.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, and/or limit the pricing the Company may charge on certain banking services, among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase costs of operations and adversely impact earnings.\nThe Company is subject to possible claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Company\u2019s performance of fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a favorable manner, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and products and services as well as impact customer demand for products and services.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nFee revenues from overdraft protection programs constitute a significant portion of our noninterest income and may be subject to increased supervisory scrutiny.\nRevenues derived from transaction fees associated with overdraft protection programs offered to the Company\u2019s customers represent a significant portion of its noninterest income. In response to recent increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny, and in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future, certain banking organizations have begun to modify their overdraft protection programs, including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees. These competitive pressures, as well as any adoption by the Company\u2019s regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks' overdraft protection practices, could cause it to modify programs and practices in ways that may have a negative impact revenue and earnings.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in the Company\u2019s accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect its results of operations, and financial condition.\nAccounting policies are fundamental to understanding the Company\u2019s results of operations, and financial condition. Some of the accounting policies are critical because they require the Company to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The Company may experience material losses if such estimates or assumptions underlying in the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes could materially impact how the Company\u2019s reports its results of operations and financial condition. New or revised standards could also require retroactive application, which could result in the restatement of the Company\u2019s prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nInternal controls may become ineffective in preventing or detecting material errors\nThe Company regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and the Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that it depends upon for success. In addition, the Bank\u2019s rural geographic marketplace, combined with relatively expensive real estate purchase prices in the many tourist communities the Company serves, create additional risks for the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which the Company operates, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.", "PERMNO": 85332, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHB"}
