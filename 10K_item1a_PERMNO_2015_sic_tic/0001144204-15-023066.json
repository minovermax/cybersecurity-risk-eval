{"cik": "1028153", "company": "Axion Power International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as all other information included in all other filings, incorporated herein by reference, when evaluating the Company and its business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nInvesting in our common stock is very speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the information in this report before making an investment decision. The following are among the risks we face related to our business, assets and operations. They are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. You should not purchase our shares unless you can afford to lose your entire investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe have a history of operating losses. We expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flow in the future and we may never achieve or sustain an operating profit or positive cash flow.\nWe have historically incurred substantial operating losses of $11.4 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014, we had retained earnings deficit of $115.3 million. These operating losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our balance sheet, statement of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements of cash flows. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then sustain profitability would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our cash requirements to fund our current operations, working capital, and non-current liabilities, in their report on our audited annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. In addition, the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our lack of cash resources may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to meet existing contractual obligations with third parties (including product warranties) or to enter into new critical contractual relations with third parties.\nWe are in the early stages of commercialization and our PbC products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market PbC products that are recognized as superior to those currently existing in the marketplace. Most of our potential customers currently use other products using different technology and may be reluctant to change those methods to a new technology. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our PbC battery solution is an attractive alternative to existing products. We will need to demonstrate that our products provide reliable and cost-effective alternatives to existing products. Compared to most competing technologies, our technology is relatively new, and most potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to adopting our technology, potential customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to testing and validating our products. Many factors influence the perception of a new technology, including its use by leaders in the industry. If we are unable to continue to induce these leaders to adopt our technology, acceptance and adoption of our products could be slowed. In addition, if our products fail to gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and we are unable to expand our customer base, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and variable, which makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and other operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our products is lengthy, which makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue in a given period, and may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. Some potential customers for our products typically need to commit significant time and resources to evaluate the technology used in our products and their decision to purchase our products may be further limited by budgetary constraints, lack of funding and numerous layers of internal review and approval, which are beyond our control. We spend substantial time and effort assisting potential customers in evaluating our products, including providing demonstrations and validation. Even after initial approval by appropriate decision makers, the negotiation and documentation processes for the actual adoption of our products can be lengthy. As a result of these factors, based on our experience to date, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a prospective customer to routine commercial utilization of our products, has varied and can sometimes be several months or longer, which has made it difficult for us to accurately project revenues and other operating results. In addition, the revenue generated from sales of our products may fluctuate from time to time due to market and general economic conditions. As a result, our financial results may fluctuate on a quarterly basis which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in the future to achieve our business objectives and to satisfy our cash obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders and possibly subordinate certain of their rights to the rights of new investors.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in order to complete our ultimate business objectives, including funding working capital to support fulfillment of future orders for our products to pay-off our subordinated notes. We also may choose to raise additional funds in debt or equity financings if they are available to us on reasonable terms to increase our working capital, strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions. Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders, which could be substantial. Additionally, if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds, the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock, including repayment of their investment, and possibly additional amounts, before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us. Such preferred shares, if authorized, might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to, or otherwise adversely affect, the rights and the value of our common stock. Also, new investors may require that we and certain of our shareholders enter into voting arrangements that give them additional voting control or representation on our board of directors.\nOur business may not be able to continue as a going concern, and we will need to raise additional capital to continue operations through the third quarter of 2015.\nWe believe that our current financial resources will support ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditures into the third quarter of 2015. However, we will not be able to continue current operations through the third quarter of 2015, without raising additional funding. We believe that there is sufficient risk in achieving revenue levels sufficient to generate liquidity adequate to cover our costs of current operations, working capital, and capital expenditures without raising additional capital. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed, our current operations, including research, development, testing, and other commercial activities will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or to continue our current operations through the third quarter of 2015. The inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue current operations and could result in our inability to continue as a going concern which would mean that we would need to wind down our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nWe depend on key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we cannot recruit a new CEO/President or we lose the services of our key executives, employees, and consultants.\nOur business is dependent upon the leadership of a seasoned CEO/President and knowledge and experience of our senior management. Given the competitive nature of our industry and the current commercial stage of our company, there is the risk we may not be able to successfully recruit a President, that one or more of our key personnel will resign their positions, which could have a disruptive impact on our operations. If any of our key personnel do not continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them and our business may be severely disrupted. We face competition for such personnel. If any of these individuals joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we could lose important know-how and experience and incur substantial expense to recruit and train suitable replacements. Our Compensation Committee remains committed to keeping our key personnel in place as we move further into our commercialization stage of our PbC product. Currently, all of our key personnel have employment contracts that include non-compete provisions.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nOur ability to manage our potential growth properly will require us to continue to improve our business processes, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If our current infrastructure is unable to handle our growth, we may need to expand our infrastructure and staff and implement new decision making and reporting systems. The time and resources required to implement such expansion and systems could adversely affect our decision making and operations. Our expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality and customer satisfaction.\nOur operations expose us to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, tax, environmental, health and safety and other legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, health and safety liabilities, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As a business with potential international reach, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we choose to operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\nIn the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the countries and jurisdictions that we choose to operate could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. There could be investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions. The potentially future global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn the sourcing of our products throughout the world, we process, store, dispose of and otherwise use large amounts of hazardous materials, especially lead and acid. As a result, we are subject to extensive and changing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; remediation of polluted ground or water; emissions or discharges of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in ongoing costs. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or to obtain or comply with required environmental permits, could result in fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators. From time to time we have had instances of alleged or actual noncompliance that have resulted in the imposition of fines, penalties and required corrective actions. Our ongoing compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits could require us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to modify or expand our facilities or continue production and require us to install additional pollution control equipment and make other capital improvements. In addition, private parties, including current or former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us or contained in our products.\nChanges in environmental and climate laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in production designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we have been or at all times will be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that we will not be required to expend significant funds to comply with, or discharge liabilities arising under, environmental laws, regulations and permits, or that we will not be exposed to material environmental, health or safety litigation.\nWe are subject to stringent federal and state environmental and safety regulation, and we do not carry environmental impairment insurance, so we may suffer material adverse effects if any fines are ever imposed.\nWe use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We are subject to varying regulations including OSHA and CERCLA and state equivalents. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. We believe that all permits and licenses required for our current business activities are in place. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our property or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition.\nOur products contain hazardous materials including lead, and any discharge could lead to monetary damages and fines.\nLead is a toxic material that is an important raw material in our batteries. We also use, generate and discharge other toxic, volatile and hazardous chemicals and wastes in our research, development and manufacturing activities. We are required to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding pollution control and environmental protection. Under some statutes and regulations, a government agency, or other parties, may seek to recover response costs from operators of property where releases of hazardous substances have occurred or are ongoing, even if the operator was not responsible for such release or otherwise at fault. In addition, more stringent laws and regulations may be adopted in the future, and the costs of complying with those laws and regulations could be substantial. If we fail to control the use of, or inadequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, we could be subject to significant monetary damages and fines, or be forced to suspend certain operations\nAs we sell our products, we may become the subject of product liability claims, and we could face substantial fines which exceed our resources.\nDue to the hazardous nature of many of the key materials used in the manufacturing of our batteries, the producers of such products may be exposed to a greater number of product liability claims, including possible environmental claims. We currently have domestic general liability insurance up to $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate to protect us against the risk that in the future a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product. We cannot assure you that as we continue distribution of our products that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate coverage on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. Even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could materially and adversely affect our reputation and prospects, and divert management\u2019s time and attention. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our future products our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay such liability.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience with respect to our PbC technology, which may translate into cost overruns in manufacturing our products.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience with respect to production of our commercial PbC negative electrodes in quantities required to achieve our operational goals, and we may not be able to retain a qualified manufacturing staff or effectively manage the manufacturing of our proposed products when we are ready to do so. We began the commercial production of our energy storage devices in the fourth quarter of 2012. As production levels increase, we may experience cost overruns in manufacturing our PbC products, and we may not have sufficient capital in the future to successfully complete such tasks. In addition, we may not be able to manufacture our products because of industry conditions, general economic conditions, and/or competition from potential manufacturers and distributors. These inabilities could cause us to abandon our current business plan and may cause our operations to eventually fail.\nWe need to continue to improve the performance of our commercial PbC products to meet future requirements and competitive pressures\nWe need to continue to improve various aspects of our PbC technology as we move forward with larger scale production and new applications of our products. Future developments and competition may reveal additional technical issues that are not currently recognized as obstacles. If we cannot continue to improve the performance of our products in a timely manner, we may be forced to redesign or delay large scale production or possibly abandon our product development efforts altogether.\nWe do not have any long-term supplier contracts.\nWe currently purchase the raw materials for our carbon electrodes and a variety of other components from third parties. We also intend to outsource manufacture of batteries using our carbon electrodes (which we will continue to manufacture in house). We do not have any long-term contracts with suppliers of raw materials and components, and our current suppliers may be unable to satisfy our future requirements on a timely basis. We have not yet secured an outsourced manufacturer for our batteries and we cannot assure that such a manufacturer will be able to satisfy our future requirements on a timely basis. Moreover, the price of purchased raw materials, components and assembled batteries could fluctuate significantly due to circumstances beyond our control. If our current suppliers and outsourced manufactures are unable to satisfy our long-term requirements on a timely basis, we may be required to seek alternative sources for necessary materials and components or redesign our proposed products to accommodate available substitutes. However, given our current state of business, we may not be able to enter into the required manufacturing supply agreements with the battery manufacturers and component suppliers.\nWe are a small player in an intensely competitive international market and may be unable to compete.\nThe lead-acid battery industry is large, intensely competitive and resistant to technological change. We may need to compete or enter into further strategic relationships with well-established companies that are much larger and have greater financial capital and other resources than we do. We may be unable to convince end users that products based on our PbC technology are superior to available alternatives. Moreover, if competitors introduce similar products, they may have a greater ability to withstand price competition and finance their marketing programs. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively.\nOur failure to introduce new products and product enhancements and broad market acceptance of new technologies introduced by our competitors could adversely affect our business.\nMany new energy storage technologies have been introduced over the past several years. For certain important and growing international energy storage markets, lithium-based battery technologies have a large and growing market share. Our ability to achieve significant and sustained penetration of key developing markets will depend upon our success in competing with these other technologies, either independently, through joint ventures, partnerships or through acquisitions. If we fail to develop or acquire, and manufacture and sell, products that satisfy our customers\u2019 demands, or we fail to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products, then market acceptance of our products could be reduced and our business could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our products will remain competitive with products based on new technologies.\nTo the extent we enter into strategic relationships, we will be dependent upon our partners.\nSome of our products are not intended for direct sale to end users and our business may require us to enter into strategic relationships with manufacturers of other power industry equipment that use batteries and other energy storage devices as important components of their finished products. The agreements governing any future strategic relationships may not provide us with control over the activities of any strategic relationship we negotiate and our future partners, if any, could retain the right to terminate the strategic relationship at their option. Our future partners will have significant discretion in determining the efforts and level of resources that they dedicate to our products and may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, our future partners may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products that are similar to or competitive with the products that we intend to produce.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe may rely on licenses for our PbC technology, which may affect our continued operations with respect thereto.\nAs we develop our PbC technology, we may need to license additional technologies to optimize the performance of our products. We may not be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our proposed products. Our inability to obtain any necessary licenses could delay our product development and testing until alternative technologies can be identified, licensed and integrated. The inability to obtain any necessary third-party licenses could cause us to abandon a particular development path, which could seriously harm our business, financial position and results of our operations.\nNew technology may lead to our competitors developing superior products which would reduce demand for our products.\nResearch into the electrochemical applications for carbon nanotechnology and other storage technologies is proceeding at a rapid pace, and many private and public companies and research institutions are actively engaged in the development of new battery technologies based on carbon nanotubes, nanostructured carbon materials and other non-carbon materials. These new technologies may, if successfully developed, offer significant performance or price advantages when compared with our technologies. There is no assurance that our existing patents or our pending and proposed patent applications will offer meaningful protection if a competitor develops a novel product based on a new technology.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and preserve our trade secrets, we will increase our vulnerability to competitors which could materially adversely impact our ability to remain in business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on our ability to protect those products and our technology with domestic and foreign patents. We will also need to continue to preserve our trade secrets. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. The patent positions of technology companies, including us, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.\nWe cannot assure you that our patents will prevent other companies from developing similar products or products which produce benefits substantially the same as our products, or that other companies will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to pay significant licensing fees in order to market our products.\nFrom time to time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties in order to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented. Additionally, we cannot assure investors that any of our products or technology will be patentable or that any future patents we obtain will give us an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents. Furthermore, we cannot assure investors that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patent protection will be secured for any particular technology, or that our issued patents will be valid or enforceable or provide us with meaningful protection.\nIf we are required to engage in expensive and lengthy litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, the costs of such litigation could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and, if we are unsuccessful, the results of such litigation could materially adversely impact our entire business.\nAlthough we have entered into invention assignment agreements with our employees and with certain advisors, if those employees or advisors develop inventions or processes independently which may relate to products or technology under development by us, disputes may also arise about the ownership of those inventions or processes. Time-consuming and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our rights under these agreements.\nWe also rely on confidentiality agreements with our strategic partners, customers, suppliers, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We may be required to commence litigation to enforce such agreements, and it is certainly possible that we will not have adequate remedies for breaches of our confidentiality agreements.\nOther companies may claim that our technology infringes on their intellectual property or proprietary rights and commence legal proceedings against us which could be time-consuming and expensive and could result in our being prohibited from developing, marketing, selling or distributing our products.\nBecause of the complex and difficult legal and factual questions that relate to patent positions in our industry, we cannot assure you that our products or technology will not be found to infringe upon the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others. Third parties may claim that our products or technology infringe on their patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights and demand that we cease development or marketing of those products or technology or pay license fees. We may not be able to avoid costly patent infringement litigation, which will divert the attention of management away from the development of new products and the operation of our business. We cannot assure investors that we would prevail in any such litigation. If we are found to have infringed on a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be liable for money damages, encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from manufacturing particular products or using particular technology.\nOther parties may challenge certain of our foreign patent applications. If such parties are successful in opposing our foreign patent applications, we may not gain the protection afforded by those patent applications in particular jurisdictions and may face additional proceedings with respect to similar patents in other jurisdictions, as well as related patents. The loss of patent protection in one jurisdiction may influence our ability to maintain patent protection for the same technology in other jurisdictions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe have issued a large number of warrants and options, which if exercised would substantially increase the number of common shares outstanding.\nOn December 31, 2014, we had 7,238,293 shares of common stock outstanding, and (a) we have 2,156,520 Series A warrants outstanding that, if fully exercised, would generate proceeds of $7,008,690 and cause us to issue up to an additional 2,156,520 shares of common stock, and (b) we have 2,156,520 Series B warrants outstanding that became \u201ccashless\u201d at February 23, 2015 that, if fully exercised would generate no proceeds. As of April 14, 2015, 1,312,904 Series B warrants have been exercised which resulted in the issuance of 63,314,146 additional shares of common stock. There are 843,346 Series B warrants that remain outstanding at April 14, 2015 and we are unable to confirm the number of common shares that would be issued upon exercise because the conversion formula changes daily, (c) we have 189,163 other warrants outstanding that, if fully exercised would generate proceeds of $1,500,202, and cause us to issue up to an additional 189,163 shares of common stock, and (d) have 135,537 options outstanding to purchase common stock that, if fully exercised would generate proceeds of $5,351,226 and result in the issuance of an additional 135,537 shares of common stock, and (e) we have Subordinated Convertible Notes outstanding to purchase common stock that if fully exercised would generate proceeds of $65,000 (excluding interest) and result in the issuance of 4,924 shares of common stock.\nAs a key component of our growth strategy we have provided and intend to continue offering compensation packages to our management and employees that emphasize equity-based compensation and would thus cause further dilution.\nHistorically, we have not paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund operational and capital expenditure needs of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, future financing instruments may do the same. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our common stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nOur stock price is speculative and there is a risk of litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following:\n\u2022\nrevenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community;\n\u2022 reduced investor confidence in equity markets, due in part to corporate collapses in recent years;\n\u2022 speculation in the press or analyst community;\n\u2022\nwide fluctuations in stock prices, particularly with respect to the stock prices for other technology companies;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 new products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in investors\u2019 beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other battery companies;\n\u2022 changes in management;\n\u2022 sales of common stock by directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nrumors or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination methods;\n\u2022 conditions and trends in the battery industry generally;\n\u2022 the announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022 general market conditions;\n\u2022 domestic or international terrorism and other factors; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in this section.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future, there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock. Defending against such suits could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, any settlement or adverse determination of such lawsuits could subject us to significant liability.\nFuture sales of our common stock could depress our stock price.\nSales of a large number of shares of our common stock, or the availability of a large number for sale, could materially adversely affect the per share market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise funds in addition offering of our debt or equity securities. In the event that we propose to register shares of common stock under the Securities Act for our own account, certain shareholders are entitled to receive notice of that registration to include their shares in the registration, subject to limitations described in the agreements granting these rights.\nOur common stock and Series A warrants are currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could be delisted.\nAs a result of our October 2014 public offering, our common stock and Series A warrants are currently eligible to be quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market. For our common stock and warrants to maintain listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must maintain NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements including but not limited to requirements to obtain shareholder approval of a transaction other than a public offering involving the sale or issuance equal to 20% or more of our common stock, our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market. We are also required to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of $2,500,000. As of December 31, 2014, our stockholders\u2019 equity is $2,944,001. However, continued operating losses will cause our stockholders\u2019 equity to fall below the minimum threshold.\nIf our common stock were to be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on the Pink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nAs a result of not meeting the minimum bid requirement for our common stock, we risk our common stock and Series A warrants being delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn February 19, 2015, we received written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, that it did not meet the $1.00 minimum bid requirement from January 5, 2015 to February 18, 2015 under NASDAQ Capital Market Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) which requires us to maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 for at least one day during any consecutive 30 day period.\nThe notification does not result in the immediate delisting of our common stock, and its common stock will continue to trade uninterrupted on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nWe have been provided with a 180 day calendar period, or until August 18, 2015, to regain compliance with this requirement. To regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, we must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this compliance period.\nWe are currently executing our best efforts to remain on The NASDAQ Capital Market and are looking at all of the options available with respect to regaining such compliance. However, if it does not achieve this goal, its stock and warrants could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs a result of the current exercisability of our Series B warrants, we are issuing multiples of our issued and outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014, which is causing severe dilution of our shareholders\u2019 interests and may cause us to run out of authorized shares of our common stock.\nThe period for the \u201ccashless exercise\u201d of the Common Series B warrants, as set forth in Section 3.3.2.1 of the related Warrant Agreement, dated October 29, 2014, which provides for further cashless exercise of these Series B warrants upon a market price for the Company\u2019s common stock of less than $3.25 per share commenced on February 22, 2015, and will continue through the 15 month anniversary of the date of the Warrant Agreement. The cashless exercise price for the Series B warrants is equal to 125% of the product lowest 5 VWAPS on a trailing 15 day basis, multiplied by 0.85, thus as the price of our common stock decreases, the number of common stock issuable upon an exercise of our B warrants increases. These shares will be issued in exchange for previously issued securities in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. As of April 14, 2015, 1,312,904 Series B have been exercised 843,346 Series B warrants remain outstanding, and the total overall issued and outstanding common stock of the Company is 70,552,439 shares. As of December 31, 2014, 2,156,250 Series B warrants are classified as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIf we are unable to meet the number of shares issuable under the Series B warrants through current authorized shares, we will be required to seek shareholder approval to either increase our authorized shares of common stock or permit us to effect a reverse split of our common stock in sufficient amounts to cover any remaining projected exercises of our Series B warrants. If we are unable to obtain shareholder approval, we will be in breach of the terms of the remaining Series B warrants.", "PERMNO": 14993, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "AXPWQ"}
