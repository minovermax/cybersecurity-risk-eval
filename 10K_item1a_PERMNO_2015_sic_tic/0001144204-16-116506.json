However, the Company believes this information may be valuable to our shareholders for this filing. The Company reserves the right to not provide risk factors in the future.\nImportant factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual business results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any forward looking statements or other projections contained in this Annual Form 10-K Report include, but are not limited to the principal risk factors set forth below. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks not presently known to the Company, or that it currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company\u2019s business and or operations. If the events discussed in these risk factors occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be adversely affected in a material way and the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nCompetition\nPrice competition and consolidation within the Snack Food industry could adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance. The Company\u2019s business requires significant marketing and sales effort to compete with larger companies. These larger competitors sell a significant portion of their products through discounting and other price-cutting techniques. This intense competition increases the possibility that the Company could lose one or more customers, lose market share and/or be forced to increase discounts, and reduce pricing, any of which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial condition, results of operation, and/or cash flow.\nCommodity Cost Fluctuations\nSignificant commodity price fluctuations for certain commodities purchased by the Company, particularly potatoes, corn, pork skins, and cooking oils could have a material impact on consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow. These price fluctuations can be impacted by various factors including weather conditions, such as flooding or drought. In an attempt to manage commodity cost fluctuations, the Company, in the normal course of business, enters into contracts to purchase pre-established quantities of various types of raw materials, at contracted prices based on expected short term needs.\nEnergy Cost Fluctuations\nThe Company can be adversely impacted by changes in the cost of natural gas and other fuel costs, such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Long term increases in the cost of natural gas and fuel costs could adversely impact and increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and marketing, selling, and delivery expenses.\nBreaches of Our Information Technology Systems\nCompany operations use and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in secure data centers and on our networks. The Company could face a number of threats to its data centers and networks, including unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to the Company that its infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers to be secure. The Company uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. Despite its security measures, information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on the Company\u2019s networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our or our customers' proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cyber security breach or technology disruption could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, a cyber attack or technology disruption could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nProduct Liability and Production Stoppage\nThe Company is subject to a risk of product liability if the Company\u2019s products actually are alleged to result, in bodily injury. While the Company maintains what it believes to be reasonable limits of stop loss insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such liability exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur significant costs in relation to such claims in the future. In addition, the Company could incur production stoppage to address production issues as well as product liability claims.\nFood Safety\nThe Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products we make or ingredients we use. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not true, may discourage consumers from buying Company products or cause disruption in production or distribution of products, which would negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, the Company could be required to recall some products because they are adulterated, mislabeled or caused consumer sickness. A recall could result in significant losses to the Company due to the costs of recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales. A recall could also result in adverse publicity and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products. The Company could also become involved in lawsuits if it is alleged that the consumption our products caused illness/injury. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Common Stock and the Securities Market\nThe trading price of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be affected by many factors and the price of shares of its common stock could decline. As a smaller publicly traded company, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile and could be subject to material price fluctuations. There are other risks and factors not described above that could also cause actual consolidated results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statement made by the Company. As set forth in the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on July 22, 2016, the Company and Utz Quality Foods, Inc. of Hanover PA announced they had entered into a merger agreement. In the event this merger is not finalized due to unforeseen circumstances then the current trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could substantially change.", "PERMNO": 39328, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "GLDC"}
