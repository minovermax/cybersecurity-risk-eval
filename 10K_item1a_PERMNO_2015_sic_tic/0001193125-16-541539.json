{"cik": "1094038", "company": "TAPIMMUNE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in our securities. These risk factors are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K and shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that a statement contained in our future filings modifies or replaces such statement. All of these risks may impair our business operations. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the results we discuss in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to operate our business and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nSince we have no sources of revenue to provide incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations, our ability to pursue our planned business activities is dependent upon our successful efforts to raise additional capital. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $6,577,000 and we anticipate that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our research efforts and operations as presently structured through the end of 2016. Accordingly, we will need to seek additional sources of financing and such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings or debt financings or through a business combination or strategic partnership. Additional capital, if needed, may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms acceptable to we may not be able to sustain our future operations and may be required to suspend our research efforts and reduce or cease our operations.\nOur auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and absent additional financing we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nIn light of our recurring losses, accumulated deficit and negative cash flow as described in our notes to our audited financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary in the event we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to establish to the satisfaction of our independent registered public accounting firm that the net proceeds from our financing efforts will be sufficient to allow for the removal of this going concern qualification, we may need to significantly modify our operational plans for us to continue as a going concern. We believe we can continue our current level of operations with the cash we have on hand without additional financing until the end of 2016. Absent sufficient additional financing, we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nWe are a development stage company with a history of operating losses.\nWe are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company with a history of losses, and we may always operate at a loss. We expect that we will continue to operate at a loss throughout our development stage, and as a result, we may exhaust our financial resources and be unable to complete the development of our products. We anticipate that our ongoing operational costs will increase significantly as we continue conducting our clinical development program. Our deficit will continue to grow during our drug development period. We have no sources of revenue to provide incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations. As outlined above, our ability to pursue our planned business activities depends upon our successful efforts to raise additional equity financing\nWe have sustained losses from operations in each fiscal year since our inception, and we expect losses to continue for the indefinite future due to the substantial investment in research and development. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $133,508,000 since inception. We expect to spend substantial additional sums on the continued administration and research and development of licensed and proprietary products and technologies with no certainty that our approach and associated technologies will become commercially viable or profitable as a result of\nthese expenditures. If we fail to raise a significant amount of capital, we may need to significantly curtail operations or cease operations in the near future. If any of our product candidates fails in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, we may never generate revenue. Even if we generate revenue in the future, we may not be able to become profitable or sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nWe have not yet sold any products or received regulatory approval to sell our products.\nWe have no approved products or products pending approval. As a result, we have not derived any revenue from the sales of products and have not yet demonstrated ability to obtain regulatory approval, formulate and manufacture commercial scale products, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Without revenue, we can only finance our company through debt and equity financings.\nUpon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to make cash payments to our warrant holders which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.\nAs of March 15, 2016, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 52,106,497 shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging between $0.10 and $25.00. The terms of the warrants provide that upon a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the warrant) the holder shall have the right to have the warrant purchased by the Company for cash at its Black Scholes Value (as defined in the warrant). The term Fundamental Transaction includes a merger, sale of substantially all of our assets, or if any person shall acquire 50% or more of the voting power of our shares. The Black Scholes Value (as defined in the warrants) payable for all of the outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $26 million.\nRisks Related to our Business and Intellectual Property\nWe may be required to make additional cash payments to warrant holders in the event any registration statement we have filed with the SEC to register the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants ceases to be effective and we are unable to deliver registered shares.\nSince we are required to deliver unlegended registered shares of common stock to certain of the warrant holders acquiring warrants in our 2015 Financings upon exercise of such outstanding warrants, we have filed a registration statement with the SEC to register such shares. The registration statement permits registered shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of such warrants. In some cases, we would be required to make additional cash payments to such warrant holders if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the relevant registration statement for the issuance of such registered shares upon an exercise by the warrant holder. For each trading day that the shares are not timely delivered we would be required to pay an amount to the holder equal to 1% of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares not issued to the holder on a timely basis and to which the holder is entitled and (B) the closing sale price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the last possible date on which we could have issued such shares to the holder. Additionally we could be required to pay the holder a \u201cbuy-in\u201d if the holder is required to purchase shares on the open market to cover any warrant shares sold. As such, the amount of additional cash payments we would be required to make could be substantial, as a percentage of our cash, if we are unable to deliver registered shares upon the warrant exercise. Currently, the registration statements we have filed are not able to be used until such time as appropriate post-effective amendments to the registration statements can be filed by us and ultimately be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While we expect to file such amendments to our registration statements promptly after our Form 10-K is filed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to file such amendments or have the post-effective amendments to our registration statements declared effective. During such time that we are not able to provide an effective registration statement and to the extent we receive any notices of exercises related to the warrants with such rights, we would be unable to deliver registered shares. In such event we could be required to make cash payments to an exercising warrant holder. We may not be able to make the required cash payments and the failure to do so could materially harm our financial condition and operations.\nWe may not be able to develop products successfully or develop them on a timely basis.\nOur immunotherapy product candidates are at various stages of research and development. Further development and extensive testing will be required to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. We will need to complete significant additional clinical trials demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA and other non-U. S. regulatory authorities. The drug approval process is time-consuming, which involves substantial expenditures of resources, and depends upon a number of factors, including the severity of the illness in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical\ntrials. Our success depends on our ability to achieve scientific and technological advances and to translate such advances into licensable, FDA-approvable, commercially competitive products on a timely basis. Failure can occur at any stage of the process. If such programs are not successful, we may be unable to develop revenue-producing products. As we enter a more extensive clinical program for our product candidates, the data generated in these studies may not be as compelling as the earlier results.\nImmunotherapies and vaccines that we may develop are not likely to be commercially available for three or more years. Any delay in obtaining FDA and/or other necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and in countries outside the United States for any investigational new drug and failure to receive such approvals would have an adverse effect on the investigational new drug\u2019s potential commercial success and on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and non-U. S. regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. For example, the FDA or non-U. S. regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or study endpoints; or we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks. In addition, the FDA or non-U. S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials or the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. The FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. The proposed development schedules for our immunotherapy product candidates may be affected by a variety of other factors, including technological difficulties, clinical trial failures, regulatory hurdles, competitive products, intellectual property challenges and/or changes in governmental regulation, many of which will not be within our control.\nAny delay in the development, approval, introduction or marketing of our products could result either in such products being marketed at a time when their cost and performance characteristics would not be competitive in the marketplace or in the shortening of their commercial lives. In light of the long-term nature of our projects, the unproven technology involved and the other factors described elsewhere in this section, we might not be able to successfully complete the development or marketing of any new products, and as a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may be required to reduce our staff, discontinue certain research or development programs of our future products and cease to operate.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community. Market acceptance of our product candidates, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n\u2022\nefficacy and safety of our product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials and post-marketing experience;\n\u2022\nclinical indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of our product candidates as safe and effective;\n\u2022\npotential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsafety of our product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications should physicians choose to prescribe for such uses;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\ncost in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of any sales and marketing efforts.\nMoreover, if our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nWe may face legal claims; Litigation is expensive and we may not be able to afford the costs.\nWe may face legal claims involving stockholders, consumers, competitors, entities from whom we license technology, entities with whom we collaborate, persons claiming that we are infringing on their intellectual property and others. As described in the discussion entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this statement, we are engaged in one legal proceeding, in which we could suffer significant financial losses. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from engaging in business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.\nThe costs of litigation or any proceeding relating to our intellectual property or contractual rights could be substantial even if resolved in our favor. Some of our competitors or financial funding sources have far greater resources than we do and may be better able to afford the costs of complex legal procedures. Also, in a law suit for infringement or contractual breaches, even if frivolous, will require considerable time commitments on the part of management, its attorneys and consultants. Defending these types of proceedings or legal actions involve considerable expense and could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur research and development programs are subject to uncertainty.\nFactors affecting our research and development programs include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncompetition from companies that are substantially and financially stronger than we are;\n\u2022\nneed for acceptance of our Immunotherapies;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and adapt to a competitive market and rapid technological developments;\n\u2022\namount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nneed to rely on multiple levels of outside funding due to the length of drug development cycles and governmental approved protocols associated with the pharmaceutical industry; and\n\u2022\ndependence upon key personnel including key independent consultants and advisors.\nOur research and development expenses may not be consistent from time to time. We may be required to accelerate or delay incurring certain expenses depending on the results of our studies and the availability of adequate funding.\nCertain of our technologies are in-licensed from third parties, and the protection of those technologies is not entirely within our control.\nWe license technologies from a third party, the Mayo Clinic, for: (i) the Her2/neu peptide epitopes, (ii) a novel set of Class II HER2/neu antigens discovered in breast cancer patients and (iii) a novel smallpox peptide antigens. In addition, we have an option, which we intend to exercise, to license the Folate Alpha Receptor technology from the Mayo Clinic. As a result of these in-licenses, we could lose the right to develop each of the technologies if:\n\u2022\nthe owners of the patent rights underlying the technologies that we license do not properly maintain or enforce the patents and intellectual property underlying those properties,\n\u2022\nthe Mayo Clinic seeks to terminate our license in contravention of the license agreements,\n\u2022\nwe fail to make all payments due and owing under any of the licenses or,\n\u2022\nwe fail to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, in-licenses from the Mayo Clinic or other for other rights that are necessary to develop the technology that we have already in-licensed.\nIf any of the above occurs, we could lose the right to use the in-licensed intellectual property, which would adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services. The loss of any current or future licenses from Mayo Clinic or the exclusivity rights provided therein could materially harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have an option to acquire an exclusive in-license technology from a third party, and if that party does not protect its license, we could lose the opportunity to develop that technology.\nIn 2014, Ayer Special Situations Funds I, LP (\u201cAyer\u201d) obtained an exclusive in-license from the Mayo Clinic to the Folate Alpha Receptor technology, and we obtained an option to acquire that exclusive in-license from Ayer. If Ayer does not maintain the in-license technology or, in contradiction of the terms of our agreement with Ayer, transfers it another party or relinquishes the in-license, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed. Ayer also may seek to terminate our option to acquire the in-license, which could cause us to lose the right to use the right to develop intellectual property and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services.\nWe rely upon patents to protect our technology. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, including Polystart, and the proprietary technology of others with whom we have entered into collaboration and licensing agreements.\nWe own or hold licenses to a number of issued patents and U. S. pending patent applications, as well as foreign patents and foreign counterparts. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection both in the United States and abroad for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. Such patent protection is costly to obtain and maintain, and sufficient funds might not be available. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Even if our product candidates, as well as methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if patents have been issued or will be issued, we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are or will be valid or enforceable or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. The laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries offer different degrees of protection against use of the patented invention by others. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. Our patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue that our patents are invalid, unenforceable, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without infringing our patents.\nWe will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies, methods of treatment, product candidates, and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and we have the funds to enforce our rights, if necessary.\nThe expiration of our owned or licensed patents before completing the research and development of our product candidates and receiving all required approvals in order to sell and distribute the products on a commercial scale can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIf we are unable to obtain licenses needed for the development of our product candidates, or if we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to patents or other intellectual property from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain and/or obtain licenses needed for the development of our product candidates in the future, we may have to develop alternatives to avoid infringing on the patents of others, potentially causing increased costs and delays in drug development and introduction or precluding the development, manufacture, or sale of planned products. Some of our licenses provide for limited periods of exclusivity that require minimum license fees and payments and/or may be extended only with the consent of the licensor. We might not meet these minimum license fees in the future or these third parties might not grant extensions on any or all such licenses. This same restriction may be contained in licenses obtained in the future.\nAdditionally, the patents underlying the licenses might not be valid and enforceable. To the extent any products developed by us are based on licensed technology, royalty payments on the licenses will reduce our gross profit from such product sales and may render the sales of such products uneconomical. In addition, the loss of any current or future licenses or the exclusivity rights provided therein could materially harm our business financial condition and our operations.\nWe may not obtain or maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity.\nWe plan to present Phase II advancement plans in early 2016 for the Folate Alpha Receptor technology in the form of an application for orphan drug status. If we are not granted orphan drug designation, the Phase II trial will be significantly longer and costlier than we currently anticipate. Even if granted, we may not receive the benefits associated with orphan drug designation. This may result from a failure to maintain orphan drug status, or result from a competing product reaching the market that has an orphan designation for the same disease indication. Under U. S. regulations for orphan drugs, if such a competing product reaches the market before ours does, the competing product could potentially obtain a scope of market exclusivity that limits or precludes our product from being sold in the United States for seven years. Even if we obtain exclusivity, the FDA could subsequently approve a drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. A competitor also may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which our orphan product has exclusivity, or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.\nIn addition, if and when we request orphan drug designation in Europe, the European exclusivity period is ten years but can be reduced to six years if the drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMEA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nWe have no manufacturing experience and have no manufacturing facility. We are dependent on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any such third parties, the manufacturing of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. To meet our projected needs for pre-clinical and clinical supplies to support\nour activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work may need to increase the scale of production. We may need to identify additional CMOs for continued production of supply for our product candidates. Although alternative third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities exist, it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute our product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control, including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any drugs we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications, and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities would require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of our product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning letter, withdraw approvals for such product candidate previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of our product candidates, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of our product candidates or their respective key materials for an ongoing pre-clinical study or clinical trial could considerably delay completion of such pre-clinical study or clinical trial, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for one of our product candidates, the commercial launch of such product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of that product candidate.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sale, marketing and distribution of products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIf we are unable to establish or manage strategic collaborations in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\nOur strategy includes eventual substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and commercialization of our cancer vaccines, and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for research, development, marketing and commercialization of our other Immunotherapies. If we are unsuccessful in securing such strategic collaborations we may be unable to commercialize our products as we have not yet licensed, marketed or sold any of our Immunotherapies or entered into successful collaborations for these services in order to ultimately commercialize our Immunotherapies. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, clinical, regulatory or intellectual property position. If we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of our Immunotherapies or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other collaborative arrangements, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold any products that we may develop.\nManagement of our relationships with our collaborators will require:\n\u2022\nsignificant time and effort from our management team;\n\u2022\ncoordination of our research and development programs with the research and development priorities of our collaborators; and\n\u2022\neffective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nIf we continue to enter into research and development collaborations at the early phases of drug development, our success will in part depend on the performance of our corporate collaborators. We will not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate collaborators to activities related to our Immunotherapies. Our corporate collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization, marketing or distribution of our Immunotherapies. If any corporate collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, our preclinical or clinical development programs related to this collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, our collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to our collaborators or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, our collaborators may have the right to terminate those agreements.\nWe need to attract and retain highly skilled personnel; we may be unable to effectively manage growth with our limited resources.\nAs of March 1, 2016, we had four full-time employees and a number of management and scientific consultants. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to our operations and expansion. We face competition for these types of personnel from other technology companies and more established organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we have. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel, or integrating them into our operations, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. In such circumstances we may be unable to conduct certain research and development programs, unable to adequately manage our clinical trials and other products, and unable to adequately address our management needs.\nWe depend upon our senior management and key consultants and their loss or unavailability could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe depend upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executive, Dr. Glynn Wilson, as well as the services of several key consultants, including Dr. John Bonfiglio and Dr. Robert Florkiewicz. The loss or unavailability of the services of either of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our manufacturers and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In addition, our systems safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our subjects. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nThe biotechnology and immunotherapy industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. We may be unable to compete with more substantial enterprises.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. As a result, our actual or proposed Immunotherapies could become obsolete before we recoup any portion of our related research and development and commercialization expenses. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is based significantly on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. We compete with specialized biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. Many biopharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area, including cancer. Many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions and governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical field will also depend to a considerable degree on the continuing availability of capital to us.\nWe are aware of certain investigational new drugs under development or approved products by competitors that are used for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of certain diseases we have targeted for drug development. Various companies are developing biopharmaceutical products that have the potential to directly compete with our Immunotherapies even though their approach may be different. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and this competition comes from both biotechnology firms and from major pharmaceutical companies. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. We also experience competition in the development of our Immunotherapies from universities, other research institutions and others in acquiring technology from such universities and institutions.\nIn addition, certain of our Immunotherapies may be subject to competition from investigational new drugs and/or products developed using other technologies, some of which have completed numerous clinical trials.\nWe are subject to numerous risks inherent in conducting clinical trials.\nWe outsource the management of our clinical trials to third parties. Agreements with clinical investigators and medical institutions for clinical testing and with other third parties for data management services, place substantial responsibilities on these parties that, if unmet, could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials. If any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with FDA-approved good clinical practices, we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If these clinical investigators, medical institutions or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, agents. We cannot be certain that we will successfully recruit enough patients to complete our clinical trials nor that we will reach our primary endpoints. Delays in recruitment, lack of clinical benefit or unacceptable side effects would delay or prevent the initiation of the Phase II, clinical trials, planned for early 2016.\nWe or our regulators may suspend or terminate our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any time if we believe they present an unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in our clinical trials or do not demonstrate clinical benefit. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the patients enrolled in our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trial operations are subject to regulatory inspections at any time. If regulatory inspectors conclude that we or our clinical trial sites are not in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for conducting clinical trials, we may receive reports of observations or warning letters detailing deficiencies, and we will be required to implement corrective actions. If regulatory agencies deem our responses to be inadequate, or are dissatisfied with the corrective actions we or our clinical trial sites have implemented, our clinical trials may be temporarily or permanently discontinued, and we may be fined, we or our investigators may be precluded from conducting any ongoing or any future clinical trials, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted.\nThe lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, which would materially harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe successful development of Immunotherapies is highly uncertain.\nSuccessful development of biopharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Immunotherapies that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons including:\n\u2022\npreclinical study results that may show the immunotherapy to be less effective than desired (e. g., the study failed to meet its primary objectives) or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u2022\nclinical study results that may show the immunotherapy to be less effective than expected (e. g., the study failed to meet its primary endpoint) or to have unacceptable side effects;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals. Among other things, such delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies, length of time to achieve study endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis, or Biologics License Application preparation, discussions with the FDA, an FDA request for additional preclinical or clinical data, or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing costs, formulation issues, pricing or reimbursement issues, or other factors that make the immunotherapy uneconomical; and\n\u2022\nthe proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent the immunotherapy from being commercialized.\nSuccess in preclinical and early clinical studies does not ensure that large-scale clinical studies will be successful. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. The length of time necessary to complete clinical studies and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one immunotherapy to the next, and may be difficult to predict.\nEven if we are successful in getting market approval, commercial success of any of our product candidates will also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and managed care organizations, which may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures designed to reduce the cost of health care. Third-party payers could require us to conduct additional studies, including post-marketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of a product, to qualify for reimbursement, which could be costly and divert our resources. If government and other health care payers were not to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one any of our products once approved, market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced.\nIn addition, if one of our products is approved for marketing, we will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration, and will need to continue to comply (or ensure that our third party providers) comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMPs\u201d) and Good Clinical Practices (\u2018GCPs\u2019), for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, there is always the risk that we or a regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a product post-approval, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency. Compliance with these requirements is costly, and any failure to comply or other issues with our product candidates post-market approval could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with significant government regulations.\nThe research and development, manufacture and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products are subject to regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state, local and foreign entities regulate, among other things, research and development\nactivities (including testing in animals and in humans) and the testing, manufacturing, handling, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of the products that we are developing. If we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, our operations will be directly or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statue and the federal False Claims Act, and privacy laws. Noncompliance with applicable laws and requirements can result in various adverse consequences, including delay in approving or refusal to approve product licenses or other applications, suspension or termination of clinical investigations, revocation of approvals previously granted, fines, criminal prosecution, civil and criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, exclusion from having our products reimbursed by federal health care programs, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow a company to enter into governmental supply contracts.\nThe process of obtaining requisite FDA approval has historically been costly and time-consuming. Current FDA requirements for a new human biological product to be marketed in the United States include: (1) the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests, if appropriate, to gain preliminary information on the product\u2019s safety; (2) filing with the FDA of an IND to conduct human clinical trials for drugs or biologics; (3) the successful completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational new drug for its recommended use; and (4) filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the FDA of a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a biological investigational new drug, to allow commercial distribution of a biologic product. The FDA also requires that any drug or formulation to be tested in humans be manufactured in accordance with its Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, regulations. This has been extended to include any drug that will be tested for safety in animals in support of human testing. The GMPs set certain minimum requirements for procedures, record-keeping and the physical characteristics of the laboratories used in the production of these drugs. A delay in one or more of the procedural steps outlined above could be harmful to us in terms of getting our Immunotherapies through clinical testing and to market.\nLitigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the products or use of our technologies infringe these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.\nIn addition, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our existing or future patents. Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding:\n\u2022\nthe patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates; and/or\n\u2022\nthe enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:\n\u2022\nincur substantial monetary damages;\n\u2022\nencounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; and/or\n\u2022\nbe precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities from any product liability claims if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our Immunotherapies in human clinical trials, and will face an even greater risk if the approved products are sold commercially. An individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of the Immunotherapies causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our Immunotherapies;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Immunotherapies; and\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty in raising required additional funds in the private and public capital markets.\nWe do not have product liability insurance because we are not selling our products yet. We intend to maintain product liability insurance consistent with industry standards upon commencement of the marketing and distribution. There can be no assurance that product liability claims will not exceed such insurance coverage limits, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of our common stock that will prevail in the market may be higher or lower than the price at which our shares of common stock, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our common stock. Those factors that could cause fluctuations include, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume of fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our net loss or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering, including issuances of preferred stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\npositive and negative events relating to healthcare and the overall pharmaceutical and biotech sector;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nsignificant dilution caused by the anti-dilutive clauses in our financial agreements;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory status of our Immunotherapies, including results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nevents affecting Mayo Clinic, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research or any future collaborators;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nfailure of our common stock to be listed or quoted on the OTCQB, the NASDAQ Capital Market, NYSE Amex Equities or other national market system;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nA DTC \u201cChill\u201d on the electronic clearing of trades in our securities in the future may affect the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital.\nThere is a risk that the Depository Trust Company (DTC) may place a \u201cchill\u201d on the electronic clearing of trades in our securities. This may lead some brokerage firms to be unwilling to accept certificates and/or electronic deposits of our stock and other securities and also some may not accept trades in our securities altogether. There is no assurance that a chill will not occur in the future. A future DTC chill would affect the liquidity of our securities and make it difficult to purchase or sell our securities in the open market. It may also have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital because investors may be unable to easily resell our securities into the market. Our inability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.\nYou may have difficulty selling our shares because they may be deemed \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d\nIf our common stock price does not increase above $5.00 per share or we are unsuccessful in listing on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange, our common stock may continue to be deemed a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1, promulgated under the Exchange Act. Penny stocks are, generally, stocks:\n\u2022\nwith a price of less than $5.00 per share;\n\u2022\nthat are neither traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange nor listed on an automated quotation system sponsored by a registered national securities association meeting certain minimum initial listing standards; and\n\u2022\nof issuers with net tangible assets less than $2.0 million (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5.0 million (if in continuous operation for less than three years), or with average revenue of less than $6.0 million for the last three years.\nSection 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-2 promulgated thereunder require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d for the investor\u2019s account. We urge potential investors to obtain and read this disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nRule 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any \u201cpenny stock\u201d to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to:\n\u2022\nobtain from the investor information about his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives;\n\u2022\nreasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has enough knowledge and experience to be able to evaluate the risks of \u201cpenny stock\u201d transactions;\n\u2022\nprovide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made his or her determination; and\n\u2022\nreceive a signed and dated copy of the statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives.\nCompliance with these requirements may make it harder for investors in our common stock to resell their shares to third parties. Accordingly, our common stock should only be purchased by investors, who understand that such investment is a long-term and illiquid investment, and are capable of and prepared to bear the risk of holding our common stock for an indefinite period of time.\nThe per share price of our common stock might not obtain or maintain the necessary levels to prevent our stock being subject to these rules in the future.\nA limited public trading market may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.\nThe quotation of our common stock on the OTCQB does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us. Our common stock is thus subject to this volatility. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our shareholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings. Our stock is thinly traded due to the limited number of shares available for trading on the market thus causing large swings in price. In addition, there is no established trading market for our warrants.\nThe market prices for our common stock may be adversely impacted by future events.\nMarket prices for our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering, including issuances of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nsignificant dilution caused by the anti-dilutive clauses in our financial agreements;\n\u2022\ncompetitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchange in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock and warrants;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of our company and the pharmaceutical and biotech industries generally; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and other national conditions.\nIf we fail to remain current with our listing requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of shareholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the OTCQB must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. If we fail to file such reports in a timely manner, the shares of our common stock would eventually cease to be quoted on the OTCQB, and the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of shareholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nOur internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures have been ineffective in the past, and may be ineffective again in the future, and failure to improve them at such time could lead to errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and a decline in our stock price.\nCertain of our outstanding warrants contain, or may be deemed to contain from time to time, embedded derivative rights in accordance with U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. These derivative rights, or similar rights in securities we may issue in the future, need to be, or may need to be, separately valued as of the end of each accounting period in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company has evaluated the application ASC 480-10 Distinguishing liabilities from equity, ASC 815-40 Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity and ASC 718-10 Compensation - Stock Compensation to the issued and outstanding warrants to purchase common stock that were issued with the convertible notes, private placements, consulting agreements, and various debt settlements during 2009 through 2012. Based on the guidance, management concluded these instruments are required to be accounted for as derivatives either due to a ratchet down protection feature available on the exercise price or a holder\u2019s right to put the warrants back to the Company for cash under certain conditions or a conversion option feature with conversion into variable number of shares. Under ASC 815-40-25, the Company records the fair value of these warrants and conversion options (derivatives) on its balance sheet, at fair value, with changes in the values reflected in the statements of operations as \u201cChanges in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d. The fair value of the share purchase warrants are recorded on the balance sheet under \u2018Derivative liability - warrants\u2019 and the fair value of the conversion options are recorded on the balance sheet under \u2018Derivative liability - conversion option\u2019.\nSales of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your rights may be reduced.\nWe expect to continue to incur drug development and sale, general and administrative costs, and to satisfy our funding requirements, we will need to sell additional equity securities, which may be subject to registration rights and warrants with anti-dilutive protective provisions. The sale or the proposed sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or other equity securities in the public markets may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially. Our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and a reduction in the price that they are able to obtain upon sale of their shares. Also, new equity securities issued may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.\nBecause we have a significant number of additional authorized shares of common stock available for issuance and outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock our stockholders may experience dilution in the future and it may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of March 1, 2016, we had 70,551,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, options and shares of common stock earned but not yet issued under Omnibus Stock Option Plan. Those outstanding shares represent 14% of our authorized shares, meaning that the ownership position of the current shareholders could be diluted significantly were we to issue a large number of additional shares. For example, as of March 15, 2016, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 52,106,000 shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging between $0.10 and $25.00 will result in dilution if and when exercised. Fear of such ownership dilution could reduce the desirability of our shares and reduce the price at which you are able to resell your shares.\nThe accounting treatment for certain of our warrants is complex and subject to judgments concerning the valuation of embedded derivative rights within the applicable securities. Fluctuations in the valuation of these rights could cause us to take charges to our statement of operations and make our financial results unpredictable.\nCertain of our outstanding warrants contain, or may be deemed to contain from time to time, embedded derivative rights in accordance with U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. These derivative rights, or similar rights in securities we may issue in the future, need to be, or may need to be, separately valued as of the end of each accounting period in accordance with GAAP. We record these embedded derivatives as liabilities at issuance, valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model and are subject to revaluation at each reporting date. Any change in fair value between reporting periods is reported on our statement of operations. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability - warrants was $26,493,000. Changes in the valuations of these rights, the valuation methodology or the assumptions on which the valuations are based could cause us to take charges to our earnings, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Moreover, the methodologies, assumptions and related interpretations of accounting or regulatory authorities associated with these embedded derivatives are complex and in some cases uncertain, which could cause our accounting for these derivatives, and as a result, our financial results, to fluctuate. There is a risk that questions could arise from investors or regulatory authorities concerning the appropriate accounting treatment of these instruments, which could require us to restate previous financial statements, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying\ncash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at our board of directors\u2019 discretion and depends on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors considers to be relevant.\nNevada law has anti-takeover provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nNevada law contains provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. We are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board of Directors without further action by shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management.\nProvisions of Nevada law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, Nevada law, among other things, provides the Board of Directors with the ability to alter the Bylaws without shareholder approval, and provide that vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nWe are also subject to Section 78.378 and 78.379 of Nevada Revised Statutes Section, which, subject to certain exceptions, imposes regulations over the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide that the provisions of these sections do not apply to the corporation or to an acquisition of a controlling interest specifically by types of existing or future stockholders, whether or not identified. In addition, the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or a resolution adopted by the directors of the issuing corporation may impose stricter requirements on the acquisition of a controlling interest in the corporation than the provisions of NRS 78.378 to 78.379.\nThese provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first negotiate with its board. These provisions may delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 16472, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MRKR"}
