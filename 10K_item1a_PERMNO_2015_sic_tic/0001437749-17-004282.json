{"cik": "1035976", "company": "FNCB Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risk factors discussed below, which could materially affect FNCB\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition, should be considered in addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the risk factors described below are not meant to be all inclusive. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that FNCB currently deems to be insignificant may also materially adversely affect its business, operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to FNCB and its Business\nFNCB may not be able to successfully compete with others for business.\nFNCB competes for loans, deposits and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks and other community banking institutions, online divisions of banks located in other markets as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, private lenders and internet-based financial technology (\u201cFintech\u201d) companies. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of its market area. As noted above, FNCB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulations and supervision, including, in many cases, regulations that limit the type and scope of activities. Many competitors have substantially greater resources and may offer certain services that FNCB and the Bank does not provide, and operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The differences in available resources and applicable regulations may make it harder for FNCB to compete profitably, reduce the rates that it can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates it must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect its overall financial condition and earnings. For additional discussion of FNCB\u2019s competitive environment, see the section entitled \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d included in Item 1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDownward trends in the economic environment could pose significant challenges for FNCB and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB is operating in a challenging economic environment, including uncertain national and local conditions. Additionally, concerns from some of the countries in the European Union, Asia and elsewhere have also strained the financial markets both abroad and domestically. Financial institutions continue to be affected by softness in the real estate market and constrained financial markets. While conditions appear to have improved since the depths of the financial crisis, generally and in FNCB\u2019s market area, should declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment re-emerge, such events could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on us and others in the financial institutions industry. Deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive loan losses beyond that which is provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201cALLL\u201d), which would necessitate further increases in the provision for loan and lease losses, and, in turn, FNCB\u2019s earnings and capital. FNCB may also face the following risks in connection with the economic environment:\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market could result in deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolios, which, in turn, could have , a negative impact on our business;\n\u25cf\nmarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and result in reduced loan demand and cause adverse changes in payment patterns, leading to a reduced asset base, as well as increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u25cf\nthe methodologies that are used to establish the ALLL rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, that are inherently uncertain and may be inadequate;\n\u25cf\nthe continuation of low market interest rates, may further pressure FNCB\u2019s interest margins as interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, are reinvested or reprice at lower rates; and\n\u25cf\nvolatility in the market, and lower level of confidence in the banking system, could require the Bank to pay higher interest rates to obtain deposits to meet the needs of its depositors and borrowers, resulting in reduced margin and net interest income. If conditions worsen, it is possible that banks such as the Bank may be unable to meet the needs of their depositors and borrowers, which could, in the worst case, result in the Bank being placed into receivership.\nIf these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, FNCB could experience adverse effects on its operating results and/or financial condition.\nFNCB is subject to lending risk.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 35.8% of FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and development loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having a higher risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. All non-performing loans totaled $2.2 million, or 0.3% of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2016, and $3.8 million, or 0.5% of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2015. Although non-performing asset levels decreased from the prior year, an increase in non-performing loans in the future could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, general economic conditions, nationally and in FNCB\u2019s primary market area, will have a significant impact on its results of operations. To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the Bank in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the Bank. To the extent that loans are secured by real estate, adverse conditions in the real estate market may reduce the ability of the borrowers to generate the necessary cash flow for repayment of the loan, and reduce the ability to collect the full amount of the loan upon a default. To the extent that the Bank makes fixed-rate loans, general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce its spread as the interest rates FNCB must pay for deposits would increase while interest income is flat. Economic conditions and interest rates may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans.\nFNCB\u2019s concentrations of loans, including those to insiders and related parties, may create a greater risk of loan defaults and losses.\nA substantial portion of FNCB\u2019s loans are secured by real estate in the Northeastern Pennsylvania market, and substantially all of its loans are to borrowers in that area. FNCB also has a significant amount of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, land acquisition and development loans and land-related loans for residential and commercial developments. At December 31, 2016, $430.1 million, or 58.8%, of gross loans were secured by real estate, primarily commercial real estate. Management has taken steps to mitigate commercial real estate concentration risk by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis. Of total gross loans, $18.4 million, or 2.5%, were construction, land acquisition and development loans. Construction, land acquisition and development loans have the highest risk of uncollectability. An additional $153.8 million, or 21.0%, of portfolio loans were commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate. Historically, commercial and industrial loans generally have had a higher risk of default than other categories of loans, such as single family residential mortgage loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business and are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. While management believes that the loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations expose FNCB to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in its general market area, could increase the levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand. In that event, FNCB would likely experience lower earnings or losses. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in its market area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area\u2019s economy, FNCB\u2019s ability to develop business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of its loans may be adversely affected, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction, land acquisition and development loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and development loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing assets. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nGuidance adopted by federal banking regulators provides that banks having concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans are expected to have and maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital, which may adversely affect shareholder returns, or require FNCB to obtain additional capital sooner than it otherwise would. Excluded from the scope of this guidance are loans secured by non-farm nonresidential properties where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the party, or affiliate of the party, who owns the property.\nOutstanding loans and line of credit balances to directors, officers and their related parties totaled $42.0 million as of December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, except for one loan relationship aggregating $381 thousand to a business partially owned by a director that was classified as \u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d there were no loans to directors, officers and their related parties that were categorized as criticized loans within the Bank\u2019s risk rating system, meaning they are not considered to present a higher risk of collection than other loans. FNCB has received all contractual principal and interest payments in a timely manner and the individual loans in the relationship were current as of December 31, 2016. Management has classified the loan relationship as special mention strictly because FNCB has not received current financial information from a non-related party to the loan agreements. For more information regarding loans to officers and directors and/or their related parties, please refer to Note 11, \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 and Item 13, \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if the ALLL is not sufficient to absorb actual losses or if increases to the ALLL were required.\nThe lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations, and that the collateral securing the payment of their obligations may be insufficient to assure repayment. FNCB may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans, which it uses as a basis to estimate and establish its reserves for losses. In determining the amount of the ALLL, management reviews loans, loss and delinquency experience, and evaluates current economic conditions. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the ALLL may not cover inherent losses in FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio at the date of its financial statements. Material additions to FNCB\u2019s allowance or extensive charge-offs would materially decrease its net income. At December 31, 2016, the ALLL totaled $8.4 million, representing 1.15% of total loans.\nAlthough management believes FNCB\u2019s underwriting standards are adequate to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of its loan portfolio due to the ongoing economic environment and the state of the real estate market. The assessment of future performance of the loan portfolio is inherently uncertain. FNCB can give no assurance that non-performing loans will not increase or that non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect its future performance.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the ALLL and may require increases to the ALLL or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in ALLL or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf management concludes that the decline in value of any of FNCB\u2019s investment securities is other-than-temporary, FNCB is required to write down the security to reflect credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings.\nManagement reviews FNCB\u2019s investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of FNCB\u2019s debt investment securities has declined below its carrying value, management is required to assess whether the decline represents an OTTI. If management concludes that the decline is other-than-temporary, it is required to write down the value of that security to reflect the credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of securities in FNCB\u2019s portfolio and/or prolonged price declines in future periods may result in OTTI, which would require a charge to earnings. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is impaired, any impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future. In addition, to the extent that the value of any of FNCB\u2019s investment securities is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, any increase in interest rates may result in a decline in the value of such investment securities.\nFNCB held approximately $3.3 million in capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\u201cFHLB\u201d) as of December 31, 2016. FNCB must own such capital stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. If the FHLB were to cease operations, FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce income, cash flows and asset values.\nFNCB\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond FNCB\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest FNCB receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) FNCB\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of FNCB\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of FNCB\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investments, FNCB\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nLaws, regulations and banking regulators require FNCB and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. In addition, capital levels are determined by FNCB\u2019s management and Board of Directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support business operations. Management regularly evaluates its present and future capital requirements and needs and analyzes capital raising alternatives and options. Although FNCB succeeded in meeting its current regulatory capital requirements, it may need to raise additional capital in the future to support possible loan losses or potential OTTI during future periods, to meet future regulatory capital requirements or for other reasons.\nThe Board of Directors may determine from time to time that FNCB needs to raise additional capital by issuing additional common shares or other securities. FNCB is not restricted from issuing additional common shares, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares. Because FNCB\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, FNCB cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Such offerings will likely be dilutive to common shareholders from ownership, earnings and book value perspectives. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, its then current common shareholders. Additionally, if FNCB raises additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, upon liquidation, holders of its debt securities and shares of preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, will receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of common shares. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders or reduce the market price of FNCB\u2019s common shares, or both. Holders of FNCB\u2019s common shares are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nFNCB cannot provide any assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit access to the capital markets may adversely affect FNCB\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if FNCB needs to raise capital, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruptions or security breaches of FNCB\u2019s information systems could negatively affect its financial performance or reputation.\nIn conducting its business, FNCB relies heavily on its information systems. FNCB collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its data centers and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to FNCB\u2019s operations and business strategy. Maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, interruption or breach of those systems. Despite security measures, FNCB\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any damage, failure or breach could cause an interruption in operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through FNCB\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or breaches could damage FNCB\u2019s reputation, disrupt operations and the services provided to customers, cause a loss of confidence in the products and the services provided, cause FNCB to incur additional expenses, result in a loss of customer business and data, result in legal claims or proceedings, result in liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, result in regulatory penalties, or expose FNCB to other liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and competitive position.\nIf FNCB\u2019s information technology is unable to keep pace with growth or industry developments or if technological developments result in higher costs or less advantageous pricing, financial performance may suffer.\nEffective and competitive delivery of FNCB\u2019s products and services increasingly depends on information technology resources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology can improve efficiency and help reduce costs. FNCB\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create efficiencies in its operations. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require FNCB to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. FNCB may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. Many of FNCB\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Additionally, as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive. There can be no assurance that FNCB will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce its ability to compete effectively. As a result, FNCB could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract customers, or be subject to cost increases.\nFNCB\u2019s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, specifically in Lackawanna, Luzerne and Wayne Counties.\nFNCB\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the specific local markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, FNCB provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Lackawanna, Luzerne and Wayne County markets. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for FNCB\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, severe weather or natural disasters, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB relies on management and other key personnel and the loss of any of them may adversely affect its operations.\nFNCB believes each member of the senior management team is important to its success and the unexpected loss of any of these persons could impair day-to-day operations as well as its strategic direction.\nFNCB\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by FNCB can be intense and it may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of FNCB\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on its business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of its market, years of industry experience and to the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nFNCB may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFNCB has been and may continue to be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation matters arising out of its business. An increased number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits and other consumer driven litigation, have been filed and will likely continue to be filed against financial institutions, which may involve substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages. Management believes the risk of litigation generally increases during downturns in the national and local economies. FNCB\u2019s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation and may cause it to incur significant expense. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, FNCB may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. For additional discussion of FNCB\u2019s current legal matters, refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFNCB\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not achieve their intended objectives.\nFNCB maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure the timely filing of reports as specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. FNCB also maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting. These controls may not achieve their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If FNCB\u2019s controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and market for its common stock, and could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nRisks Related to FNCB\u2019s Common Stock\nThe price of FNCB\u2019s common shares may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell common shares at a time or price they find attractive.\nFNCB\u2019s common stock per share price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include, in addition to those described above:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to FNCB or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to FNCB\u2019s reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by FNCB or its competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of FNCB\u2019s competitors;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of FNCB\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, audits or litigation that involve or affect FNCB;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to FNCB\u2019s performance; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nDuring 2016, the per share closing bid price of FNCB\u2019s common stock on the OTCQX Marketplace (\u201cOTCQX\u201d) ranged from a low of $4.75 on August 29, 2016, to a high of $6.90 on February 1, 2016.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect FNCB\u2019s share price, notwithstanding its operating results. Management expects that the market price of its common shares will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the market prices for its common shares.\nAn active public market for FNCB\u2019s common stock does not currently exist. As a result, shareholders may not be able to quickly and easily sell their common shares.\nFNCB\u2019s common shares are currently quoted on the OTCQX. During the year ended December 31, 2016, an average of 3,484 shares traded on a daily basis. There can be no assurance that an active and liquid market for FNCB\u2019s common shares will develop, or if one develops that it can be maintained. The absence of an active trading market may make it difficult for FNCB shareholder to sell FNCB\u2019s common shares at the prevailing price, particularly in large quantities. For a further discussion, see Item 5, \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFNCB\u2019s ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares is subject to limitations.\nFNCB conducts its principal business operations through the Bank and the cash that it uses to pay dividends is derived from dividends paid to FNCB by the Bank; therefore, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on the performance of the Bank and on the Bank\u2019s capital requirements. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to FNCB and FNCB\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are also limited by certain legal and regulatory restrictions.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Accounting Pronouncements\nFNCB is subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and possible regulatory enforcement actions, which may subject it to higher costs and lower shareholder returns.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. The extensive regulatory framework is primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not shareholders. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and, in some instances, may put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, leasing companies and internet-based Fintech companies. FNCB\u2019s regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses, among other matters. If they deem FNCB to be operating in a manner inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, these regulatory authorities can require the entry into informal and formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, settlement agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which FNCB would be required to implement identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and/or to refrain from taking certain actions in the form of injunctive relief. In recent years, the banking industry has faced increased regulation and scrutiny; for instance, areas such as BSA compliance (including BSA and related anti-money laundering regulations) and real estate-secured consumer lending (such as Truth-in-Lending regulations, changes in Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations, implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and more recently, heightened regulatory attention to mortgage and foreclosure-related activities and exposures) are being confronted with escalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny. Non-compliance with laws and regulations such as these, even in cases of inadvertent non-compliance, could result in litigation, significant fines and/or sanctions. Any failure to comply with, or any change in, any applicable regulation and supervisory requirement, or change in regulation or enforcement by such authorities, whether in the form of policies, regulations, legislation, rules, orders, enforcement actions, or decisions, could have a material impact on FNCB, the Bank and other affiliates, and its operations. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect FNCB\u2019s ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. Any failure to comply with such regulation or supervision could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from FNCB\u2019s operations, cause it to incur significant expenses, restrict it from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit its ability to raise capital.\nThe impact of recent legislation, proposed legislation, and government programs designed to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time, and such legislation is subject to change. In addition, any instability in financial markets and weakening in current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and access to capital.\nNew or changed legislation or regulation and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect FNCB through increased regulation and increased costs of doing business.\nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulation may affect FNCB\u2019s operations. New and modified regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, may have unforeseen or unintended consequences on the banking industry. The Dodd-Frank Act has implemented significant changes to the U.S. financial system, including the creation of new regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council to oversee systemic risk and the CFPB to develop and enforce rules for consumer financial products), changes in retail banking regulations, and changes to deposit insurance assessments. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has implemented new requirements with respect to \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d and new mortgage servicing standards that may increase costs associated with this business. For a more detailed description, see the section entitled \u201cBusiness - The Bank - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u201d included in Item 1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, final rules to implement Basel III adopted in July 2013 revise risk-based and leverage capital requirements and also limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if a banking organization does not hold the required \u201ccapital conservation buffer.\u201d The rule became effective for FNCB on January 1, 2015, with some additional transition periods. This additional regulation could increase compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect operations. For a more detailed description of the final rules, see the description in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cCapital Adequacy Requirements\u201d. The potential also exists for additional federal or state laws or regulations, or changes in policy or interpretations, affecting many of FNCB\u2019s operations, including capital levels, lending and funding practices, insurance assessments, and liquidity standards. The effect of any such changes and their interpretation and application by regulatory authorities cannot be predicted, may increase FNCB\u2019s cost of doing business and otherwise affect FNCB\u2019s operations, may significantly affect the markets in which it does business, and could have a materially adverse effect on FNCB.\nFNCB is also subject to the guidelines under the GLB Act. The GLB Act guidelines require, among other things, that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. In recent years there also has been increasing enforcement activity in the areas of privacy, information security and data protection in the United States, including at the federal level. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations regarding the privacy, security and protection of customer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs. In addition, non-compliance could result in potentially significant fines, penalties and damage to FNCB\u2019s reputation and brand.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nFrom time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. These changes can materially impact how FNCB records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, FNCB could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.", "PERMNO": 17359, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNCB"}
