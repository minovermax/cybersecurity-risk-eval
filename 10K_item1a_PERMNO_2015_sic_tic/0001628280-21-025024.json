{"cik": "1001614", "company": "Riley Exploration Permian, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Other risks are described in Item 1. Business and Properties, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline. Investors should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Strategy\nOil, natural gas, and NGL prices are volatile. An extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Additionally, the value of our reserves calculated using SEC pricing may be higher than the fair market value of our reserves calculated using current market prices.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGL production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. Oil, natural gas, and NGLs are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the commodities market has been volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2021, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (referred to as WTI) oil prices ranged from a high of $77.41 per Bbl on June 27, 2018 to a low of $(36.98) per Bbl on April 20, 2020. During fiscal 2021, WTI prices ranged from a high of $75.54 to a low of $35.64 per Bbl. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub gas ranged from a high of $23.86 per MMBtu to a low of $1.41 per MMBtu during fiscal 2021. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile, reverse their recent increases, or decline, our operations, financial condition, cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the duration and magnitude of any decline in oil, natural gas or NGL prices cannot be predicted with accuracy, and this market will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022the price and quantity of foreign imports, including foreign oil;\n\u2022the actions by members of OPEC;\n\u2022political, economic, and military conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including embargoes or conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022prevailing prices on local price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas and conducting other operations;\n\u2022the recovery rates of new oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;\n\u2022lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products, and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022late deliveries of supplies;\n\u2022technical difficulties or failures;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost, and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022localized and global weather conditions;\n\u2022public health concerns such as COVID-19;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption, including advances in exploration, development and production technologies;\n\u2022shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of companies in our industry to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022domestic, local, and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower commodity prices will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in the present value of our reserves and our ability to develop future reserves. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically. We have historically been able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at prices that are significantly higher than current strip prices. However, in the current commodity price environment, our ability to enter into comparable derivative arrangements may be limited, and, in the future, we will not be under an obligation to hedge a specific portion of our oil or natural gas production.\nUsing lower prices in estimating proved reserves would likely result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits. While it is difficult to project future economic conditions and whether such conditions will result in impairment of proved property costs, we consider several variables including specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors. In addition, sustained periods with oil and natural gas prices at levels lower than current West Texas Intermediate strip prices and the resultant effect such prices may have on our drilling economics and our ability to raise capital may require us to re-evaluate and postpone or eliminate our development drilling, which could result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves and related standardized measure. If we are required to curtail our drilling program, we may be unable to continue to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce our reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur exploration and development projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the exploitation, development, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. We expect to fund our growth primarily through cash flow from operations, availability under our revolving credit facility, and subsequent equity or debt offerings when appropriate. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells and the timing of such production;\n\u2022the prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022operating costs and other expenses;\n\u2022the availability of takeaway capacity;\n\u2022credit facility and/or investor requirements;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nIf our revenue or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decreases as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot provide assurance that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our undeveloped acreage. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire, or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs, and potential liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. For these reasons, the properties we have acquired or will acquire in the future may not produce as projected or may be more costly to operate than projected. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not review every well, pipeline or associated facility. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion or groundwater contamination, when a review is performed. We may be unable to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may revise reserve estimates to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, existing commodity prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our reserves should not be assumed to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. For example, our estimated proved reserves as of September 30, 2021 were calculated under SEC rules using the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months of $57.64 per Bbl for oil and NGL volumes and $2.943 per MMBtu for natural gas volumes. Using lower prices in estimating proved reserves would likely result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.\nThere is a limited amount of production data from horizontal wells completed in the Permian Basin and its San Andres Formation. As a result, reserve estimates associated with horizontal wells in this area are subject to greater uncertainty than estimates associated with reserves attributable to vertical wells in the same area.\nReserve engineers rely in part on the production history of nearby wells in establishing reserve estimates for a particular well or field. Horizontal drilling in the San Andres Formation of the Permian Basin is a relatively recent development, whereas vertical drilling has been utilized by producers in this area for over 50 years. As a result, the amount of production data from horizontal wells available to reserve engineers is relatively small compared to that of production data from vertical wells. Until a greater number of horizontal wells have been completed in the San Andres Formation, and a longer production history from these wells has been established, there may be a greater variance in our proved reserves on a year-over-year basis due to the transition from vertical to horizontal reserves in both the proved developed and proved undeveloped categories. Such variance could be material and any such variance could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. As of September 30, 2021, we have drilled and completed 75 gross operated horizontal wells on our West Texas and New Mexico acreage, and therefore are subject to increased risks associated with horizontal drilling as compared to companies that have greater experience in horizontal drilling activities. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, failing to land our wellbore in the desired drilling zone, not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, not running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, not being able to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations and not successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nAdditionally, certain of the new techniques we are adopting may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficient time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or commodity prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nApproximately 27% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nOil and natural gas leases generally must be drilled before the end of the lease term or the leaseholder will lose the lease and any capital invested therein. In addition, leases may also be lost due to legal issues relating to the ownership of leases. Any delays in drilling or legal issues causing us to lose leases on properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and reserve growth.\nAs of September 30, 2021, approximately 27% of our net leasehold acreage was undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nOur drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control. Such factors include drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop such properties.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in the Northwest Shelf within the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. Specifically, as the Permian Basin is an area of high industry activity, we may be unable to hire, train, or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Northwest Shelf sub-basin within the Permian Basin of West Texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. At September 30, 2021, the majority of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time and, when compared to other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages or other drought or extreme weather related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nSpecifically, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, may increase substantially in the future. Moreover, our competitors, including those operating in multiple basins, may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could have a negative effect on production volumes or significantly increase costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, the geographic concentration of our assets including our total estimated proved reserves as of September 30, 2021, exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nOur drilling and production programs may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to truck transportation, pipelines, gas gathering, transmission, storage and processing facilities to market our oil and natural gas production, certain of which we do not control, and our initiatives to expand our access to midstream and operational infrastructure may be unsuccessful.\nThe marketing of oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the capacity and availability of pipelines and storage facilities, trucks, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities. Access to such facilities is, in many respects, beyond our control. If these facilities are unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit, and sell our oil and natural gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and natural gas reserves, the expected results of our drilling program and our cash flow and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. For example, increases in activity in the Permian Basin could contribute to bottlenecks in processing and transportation that may negatively affect our results of operations, and these adverse effects could be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors.\nSimilarly, the concentration of our assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules, which could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Permian Basin, we are subject to increasing competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages or delays. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nWhile we have undertaken initiatives to expand our access to midstream and operational infrastructure, these initiatives may be delayed or unsuccessful. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe prices we receive for our production may be affected by local and regional factors.\nThe prices we receive for our production will be determined to a significant extent by factors affecting the local and regional supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the adequacy of the pipeline and processing infrastructure in the region to process and transport our production and that of other producers. Those factors result in basis differentials between the published indices generally used to establish the price received for regional oil and natural gas production and the actual price we receive for our production, which may be lower than index prices. If the price differentials pursuant to which our production is subject were to widen due to oversupply or other factors, our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nAn increase in the differential between NYMEX WTI and the reference or regional index price used to price our oil and natural gas would reduce our cash flows from operations.\nOur oil and natural gas is priced in the local markets where it is produced based on local or regional supply and demand factors. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas are typically lower than the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX WTI. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. Numerous factors may influence local pricing, such as pipeline capacity and processing infrastructure. Additionally, insufficient pipeline or transportation capacity, lack of demand in any given operating area or other factors may cause the differential to increase in a particular area compared with other producing areas. For example, production increases from competing Permian Basin producers, combined with limited pipeline and transportation capacity in the area, have gradually widened differentials in the Permian Basin.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, our realized oil differential to NYMEX WTI averaged $(2.81) per Bbl of oil and our realized natural gas differential to NYMEX Henry Hub averaged $(0.63) per Mcf of gas. Given that a significant amount of our production is from the Permian Basin, if the negative price differential in the Permian Basin increases, we expect that the effect of our price differential on our revenues will also increase. Increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and natural gas, such as the NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub, and the realized price we receive could significantly reduce our revenues and our cash flow from operations.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt September 30, 2021, approximately 42% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Our approximate 30,647 MBoe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves are estimated to require an estimated $207.1 million of development capital. Our development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We expect to fund our growth primarily through cash flow from operations, availability under our revolving credit facility, and subsequent equity or debt offerings when appropriate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties will own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, may be unable to access debt or equity financing, and, in some cases, may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWe own non-operating interests in properties developed and operated by third parties, and as a result, we are unable to control the operation and profitability of such properties.\nWe participate in the drilling and completion of wells with third-party operators that exercise exclusive control over such operations. As a participant, we rely on the third-party operators to successfully operate these properties pursuant to joint operating agreements and other similar contractual arrangements.\nAs a participant in these operations, we may not be able to maximize the value associated with these properties in the manner we believe appropriate, or at all. For example, we cannot control the success of drilling and development activities on properties operated by third parties, which depend on a number of factors under the control of a third-party operator, including such operator\u2019s determinations with respect to, among other things, the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities, the timing and amount of capital expenditures and the selection of suitable technology. In addition, the third-party operator\u2019s operational expertise and financial resources and its ability to gain the approval of other participants in drilling wells will impact the timing and potential success of drilling and development activities in a manner that we are unable to control. A third-party operator\u2019s failure to adequately perform operations, breach of the applicable agreements or failure to act in ways that are favorable to us could reduce our production and revenues, negatively impact our liquidity and cause us to spend capital in excess of our current plans, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline, we may incur impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploitation, development and exploration activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce.\nThe availability of a ready market for any oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of oil and gas sold in interstate commerce. In addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production.\nWe have exposure to credit risk through receivables from purchasers of our oil, natural gas and NGL production. One purchaser accounted for 87% of our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2021. This concentration of purchasers may impact our overall credit risk in that this purchaser may be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions or commodity price fluctuations. We do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant purchaser to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, some of which are beyond our control. We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and under insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering or other cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, well fluids and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses, reservoir damage and environmental hazards such as oil, produced water or chemical spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022employee/employer liabilities and risks, including wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims, and general human resource related matters;\n\u2022damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental hazards or damage;\n\u2022abnormally pressured formations, fires or explosions or natural disasters;\n\u2022mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022landowner claims for property damage and restoration costs;\n\u2022suspension of our operations; and repair and remediation costs;\n\u2022repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in our industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our systems are deployed may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nMoreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and on commercially reasonable terms. Also, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or fully covered by insurance and any delay in the payment of insurance proceeds for covered events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProperties that we decide to drill may not yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from prospects that are currently being drilled, to prospects that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation. Properties that we decide to drill that do not yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of micro-seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022pressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022equipment failure or accidents;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u2022increase in the cost of, shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nWe may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of oil and gas properties or businesses that complement or expand our current business. The successful acquisition of oil and gas properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future oil, natural gas and NGL prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022estimates of operating costs;\n\u2022estimates future development costs;\n\u2022estimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u2022environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify accretive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Reviews may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as subsurface or groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when a review is performed. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. Even if we do identify accretive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions as well as limits our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of lease brokers or land men who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we do typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nOur operations could be impacted by burdens and encumbrances on title to our properties.\nOur leasehold and other acreage may be subject to existing oil and natural gas leases, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions customary in the oil and natural gas industry. Such liens and burdens could materially interfere with the use or otherwise affect the value of such properties. Additionally, any cloud on the title of the working interests, leases and other rights owned by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expirations to hold the acreage by production or by other operations. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of our drilling locations are identified, our leases for such acreage will expire. As of September 30, 2021, 79% of our net undeveloped acreage is set to expire through 2022. We intend to extend or renew any core lease we plan to develop or are still assessing for development that is set to expire in 2022 and expect to incur $0.3 million to extend or renew those leases, without taking into account the drilling of wells and holding leases by production. Where we do not have the option to extend a lease, however, we may not be successful in negotiating extensions or renewals. Our ability to drill and develop our core acreage and establish production to maintain our leases depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. These risks are greater at times and in areas where the pace of our exploration and development activity slows.\nWe plan to use CO2 for our EOR projects. Our production from these EOR operations may decline if we are not able to obtain sufficient amounts of CO2.\nOil production from our EOR projects depends on, among other factors, having access to sufficient amounts of CO2 from our third party suppliers of CO2. Our ability to produce oil from our EOR projects would be hindered if the supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, physical limitations on CO2 supply or the ability to economically procure CO2 at costs low enough to ensure the economic viability of our EOR projects. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future oil production from the Company\u2019s EOR projects is dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, our ability to obtain sufficient volumes of CO2. Market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring CO2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic CO2 as a byproduct that can be purchased, thus limiting the amount of CO2 available for use in our EOR projects.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nAcquisitions of assets or businesses may reduce, rather than increase, our distributable cash flow or may disrupt our business.\nEven if we make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in our cash flow. Any acquisition involves potential risks that may disrupt our business, including the following, among other things:\n\u2022mistaken assumptions about volumes or the timing of those volumes, revenues or costs, including synergies;\n\u2022an inability to successfully integrate the acquired assets or businesses;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022exposure to potential lawsuits;\n\u2022limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas; and\n\u2022customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nWe may need to access funding through capital market transactions. Due to our small public float, low market capitalization, limited operating history, ESG, and climate change restrictions, it may be difficult and expensive for us to raise additional funds.\nWe may need to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or securities linked to our common stock. Our ability to raise these funds may be dependent on a number of factors, including the risk factors further described herein and the low trading volume and volatile trading price of our shares of common stock. The stocks of small cap companies tend to be highly volatile. We expect that the price of our common stock will be highly volatile for the next several years.\nAs a result, we may be unable to access funding through sales of our common stock or other equity-linked securities. Even if we were able to access funding, the cost of capital may be substantial due to our low market cap and small public float. The terms of any funding we are able to obtain may not be favorable to us and may be highly dilutive to our stockholders. We may be unable to access capital due to unfavorable market conditions or other market factors outside of our control such as ESG and/or climate change restrictions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed. The failure to obtain additional capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and our ability to declare dividends.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility restrict, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, engage, expand or pursue our business activities or pay dividends. Our revolving credit facility restricts, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, its ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur indebtedness;\n\u2022issue certain equity securities, including preferred equity securities;\n\u2022incur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u2022sell or transfer assets;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022redeem or repurchase shares from our stockholders;\n\u2022pay dividends to our stockholders unless the net leverage ratio does not exceed 2.75 to 1.0, the total revolving credit exposures under our revolving credit facility are not greater than 80% of the total revolving commitments, and no default or event of default then exists or would exist upon the payment of the dividend;\n\u2022make certain payments of junior indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022enter into certain restrictive agreements; and\n\u2022enter into swap agreements and hedging arrangements.\nOur ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of free cash flow and events or circumstances beyond our control, such as a downturn in our business or the economy in general or\nreduced oil, natural gas and NGL prices. A failure to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. Further, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be restricted and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and our common stock holders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. In addition, our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, the lenders can seek to foreclose on our assets.\nOur indebtedness could reduce our financial flexibility.\nThe level of our indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022a significant portion of our cash flow could be used to service the indebtedness;\n\u2022a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments; and\n\u2022a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The borrowing base depends on, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the proved oil and natural gas properties securing our loan. The value of our proved reserves is dependent upon, among other things, the prevailing and expected market prices of the underlying commodities in our estimated reserves. A further reduction or sustained decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. We could be forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings or transfer to the lenders additional collateral due to redeterminations of our borrowing base that result in a reduction of the available revolving commitments. If we are forced to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments or provide such collateral. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings, provide additional collateral or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover the defaulting lender\u2019s portion. Declines in commodity prices could result in a redetermination and reduction of the borrowing base in the future and, in such a case, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the reduced borrowing base. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt arrangements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of our existing revolving credit facility or future debt arrangements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis could harm our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. Our revolving credit facility currently restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nIn addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful or result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nWe enter or may enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our production, primarily consisting of swaps, put options and call options. We purchase such derivatives to achieve more predictable cash flows, to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and in order to remain in compliance with covenants in our revolving credit facility. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments also can expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced, which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness, and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile oil, natural gas, and NGL prices and interest rates. In addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur commodity derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.\nDuring periods of declining commodity prices, our derivative contract receivable positions could generally increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss with respect to our commodity derivative contracts.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, development, and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop, or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results\nof which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\u201d In addition, our cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay, or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022delays and increased costs imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements including limitations on or resulting from wastewater discharge and disposal, subsurface injections, greenhouse gas emissions, and hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in availability of drilling rigs and qualified personnel for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining water resources, suitable proppant, and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, such as tornadoes, droughts, ice storms, and extreme freeze events;\n\u2022lack of available treatment or disposal options for oil and gas waste, including produced water;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022issues related to permitting under and compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations;\n\u2022declines or volatility in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices;\n\u2022limited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022title problems or legal disputes regarding leasehold rights; and\n\u2022limitations in the market for oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. Fuel and other energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil, natural gas and NGLs, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or services at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to effectively use, implement or adapt to new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the impact of the changing demand for oil and gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nWe are highly dependent upon third-party services. The cost of oilfield services typically fluctuates based on demand for those services. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, natural gas and NGL prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLimitation or restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWater is an essential component of shale and conventional oil and natural gas development during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. In addition, treatment and disposal of flowback and produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Thus, our costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly. Our inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact our exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe unavailability or high cost of equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services used to drill and complete wells could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Our operations are concentrated in areas in which activity has increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, has increased, as have the costs for those items. In addition, to the extent our suppliers source their products or raw materials from foreign markets, the cost of such equipment could be impacted if the United States imposes tariffs on imported goods from countries where these goods are produced. Such shortages or cost increases could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties and market oil or natural gas.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, climate change, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and the United States financial market have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile commodity prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost.\nIf one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, seismic activity, greenhouse gas emissions, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nRisks Related to COVID-19, Acts of God, and Cyber Security\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread quickly across the globe, federal, state and local governments mobilized to implement containment mechanisms and minimize impacts to their populations and economies. Various containment measures, which included the quarantining of cities, regions and countries, while aiding in the prevention of further outbreak, have resulted in a severe drop in general economic activity and a resulting decrease in energy demand.\nThe timeline and potential magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak is currently unknown. The continuation or amplification of this virus could continue to more broadly affect the United States and global economy, including our business and operations, and the demand for oil and gas. For example, a significant outbreak of coronavirus or other contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its global spread have recently negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility. As the potential impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which will be beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPower outages, limited availability of electrical resources, and increased energy costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur operations are subject to electrical power outages, regional competition for available power, and increased energy costs. Power outages, which may last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, would harm our operations and our business.\nWe also may be subject to risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies. Such utilities may be dependent on, and sensitive to price increases for, a particular type of fuel, such as coal, oil or natural gas. The price of these fuels and the electricity generated from them could increase as a result of proposed legislative measures related to climate change or efforts to regulate carbon or other greenhouse gas emissions.\nExtreme weather conditions could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in the areas where we operate.\nOur exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as floods, lightening, drought, ice and other storms, prolonged freeze events, and tornadoes, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as electrical power, water, gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or\nhigh costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. For example, the industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. As an oil and natural gas producer, our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. We face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory, and Tax Matters\nWe are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and occupational health and safety issues that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental and human health protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including (i) the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling, production, and other regulated activities; (ii) the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; (iii) the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, protected species habitat, and other protected areas; (iv) the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; (v) the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations; (vi) the installation of costly emission monitoring and/or pollution control equipment; and (vii) the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated, stored, processed, or released in connection with our properties. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and analogous state agencies, and state oil and natural gas commissions, such as the Railroad Commission of Texas, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting\nsome or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations or specific projects and limit our growth and revenue.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of historical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased and owned properties, as well as locations where waste from our operations is transported offsite for disposal. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and even if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and tend to become more stringent over time, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, on October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for ground-level ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per billion, or ppb, for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards. Subsequently, the EPA designated over 200 counties across the U.S. as \u201cnonattainment\u201d for these standards, meaning that new and modified stationary emissions sources in these areas are subject to more stringent permitting and pollution control requirements. On December 23, 2021, the EPA announced its decision to retain, without changes, the 2015 NAAQs. If our operations become subject to these more stringent standards, compliance with these and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit our ability to obtain permits for operations or require us to install additional pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u2022permits for drilling operations;\n\u2022drilling bonds;\n\u2022reports concerning operations;\n\u2022the spacing of wells;\n\u2022the rates of production;\n\u2022the plugging and abandoning of wells;\n\u2022unitization and pooling of properties; and\n\u2022taxation.\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are responsible for the decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation costs for our facilities.\nWe are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation of our facilities at the end of their economic life, the costs of which may be substantial. It is not possible to predict these costs with certainty since they will be a function of regulatory requirements at the time of decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation. We may, in the future, determine it prudent or be required by applicable laws or regulations to establish and fund one or more decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation reserve funds to provide for payment of future decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation costs, which could decrease funds available to service debt obligations. In addition, such reserves, if established, may not be sufficient to satisfy such future decommissioning, plugging, abandonment, and reclamation costs and we will be responsible for the payment of the balance of such costs.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves, or PUDs, may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill or plan on delaying those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory agency administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the \u201cNGA\u201d) to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.0 million/d for each violation. FERC may also impose administrative and criminal remedies and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and regulations pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) has regulations intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry with authority to fine violators of the regulations civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per day, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), prohibits market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC, including similar anti-manipulation authority with respect to oil swaps and futures contracts as that granted to the CFTC with respect to oil purchases and sales. The CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1.0 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of our natural gas assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our natural gas assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. We believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional test that FERC has used to determine whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and gathering services not subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act (\u201cNGPA\u201d).\nSuch regulation could decrease revenue and increase operating costs. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by FERC.\nFERC regulation may indirectly impact gathering services not directly subject to FERC regulation. FERC\u2019s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, FERC has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the natural gas gathering services.\nNatural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nWe may, from time to time, be a claimant or defendant to various legal proceedings, disputes and claims arising in the course of our business, including those that arise from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry, personal injury claims, title disputes, royalty disputes, contract claims, contamination claims relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development and environmental claims, including claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer part of our current operations. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process.\nFor example, in February 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s (\u201cSDWA\u201d) Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. Also, beginning in 2012, the EPA issued a series of regulations under the federal Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) that include New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d), known as Subpart OOOO, for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and certain other plants and equipment and, in May 2016, published a final rule establishing new emissions standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, for methane and volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category. The NSPS Subpart OOOO and OOOOa rules have since been subject to numerous legal challenges as well as EPA reconsideration proceedings and subsequent amendment proposals. Most recently, on September 14 and 15, 2020, EPA published two new rules in the Federal Register that remove the transmission and storage sectors of the oil and gas industry from regulation under the NSPS and rescind methane-specific standards for the production and processing segments of the industry. However, states and environmental groups brought suit challenging the new rules almost immediately, and in June 2021, Congress partially overturned the rollback. Furthermore, in November 2021, EPA issued a proposed rule which would update, strengthen, and expand the NSPS Subpart OOOOa regulations for methane and VOC emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed sources. Notably, the proposed rule also includes emissions guidelines to assist states in the development of plans to regulate methane emissions from certain existing sources. Legal challenges to the proposed rule are likely to follow, and accordingly, legal uncertainty exists with respect to the future scope and extent of implementation of the methane rule; however, even as currently implemented, these rules apply to our operations, including requirements for the installation of equipment to control VOC emissions from certain hydraulic fracturing of wells and fugitive emissions from well site and other production equipment, and additional regulation, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact or delay oil and natural gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. The BLM and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior are now being sued for the decision to rescind the rule. In April 2020, the Northern District of California issued a ruling in favor of the BLM and the Department of the Interior. This ruling is now being appealed; thus, the future of the rule remains uncertain. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been introduced in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but, to date, such legislation has not been\nadopted. At the state level, Texas, where we conduct our operations, is among the states that has adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, including the requirement for hydraulic-fracturing operators to complete and submit a list of chemicals used during the fracking process. We may incur significant additional costs to comply with such existing state requirements and, in the event additional state level restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.\nMoreover, we typically dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in underground disposal wells. This disposal process has been linked to increased induced seismicity events in certain areas of the country, particularly in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Arkansas. These and other states have begun to consider or adopt laws and regulations that may restrict or otherwise prohibit oilfield fluid disposal in certain areas or underground disposal wells, and state agencies implementing these requirements may issue orders directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations or impose standards related to disposal well construction and monitoring. For example, in 2014, the RRC published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. Any one or more of these developments may result in our having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or to cease disposal well activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, several cases have recently put a spotlight on the issue of whether injection wells may be regulated under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the \u201cClean Water Act\u201d or \u201cCWA\u201d) if a direct hydrological connection to a jurisdictional surface water can be established. The split among federal circuit courts of appeals that decided these cases engendered two petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in August 2018, one of which was granted in February 2019. EPA has also brought attention to the reach of the CWA\u2019s jurisdiction in such instances by issuing a request for comment in February 2018 regarding the applicability of the CWA permitting program to discharges into groundwater with a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water, which hydrological connections should be considered \u201cdirect,\u201d and whether such discharges would be better addressed through other federal or state programs. In a statement issued by EPA in April 2019, the agency concluded that the CWA should not be interpreted to require permits for discharges of pollutants that reach surface waters via groundwater. However, in April 2020, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case, County of Maui, Hawaii v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, holding that discharges into groundwater may be regulated under the CWA if the discharge is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct discharge into navigable waters. On January 14, 2021, EPA issued guidance on the ruling, which emphasized that discharges to groundwater are not necessarily the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct discharge based solely on proximity to jurisdictional waters. However, on September 16, 2021, EPA rescinded its prior guidance. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in County of Maui, Hawaii v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund could result in increased operational costs if permits are required under the CWA for disposal of our flowback and produced water in underground disposal wells.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process and associated processes could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated increase in compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nClimate change legislation and regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). While no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, the EPA and states or groupings of states have pursued legal initiatives in recent years that seek to reduce GHG emissions through efforts that include consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and\ntracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In particular, the EPA has adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish certain permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, which reviews could require securing permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting defined technological standards for those GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore production.\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing NSPS Subpart OOOOa, which requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and VOC emissions. Although much of the initial rules remain intact and effective, the rules have been subject to legal challenges, reconsideration by EPA, stays, and proposed amendments. For example, on September 14 and 15, 2020, EPA published two new final rules in the Federal Register that remove the transmission and storage sectors of the oil and gas industry from regulation under the NSPS and rescind methane-specific standards for the production and processing segments of the industry. However, states and environmental groups brought suit challenging the new rules almost immediately, and in June 2021, Congress partially overturned the rollback. Furthermore, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule which would update, strengthen, and expand the NSPS Subpart OOOOa regulations for methane and VOC emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed sources. Notably, the proposed rule also includes emissions guidelines to assist states in the development of plans to regulate methane emissions from certain existing sources. The BLM also finalized rules regarding the control of methane emissions in November 2016 that applied to oil and natural gas exploration and development activities on public and tribal lands. The rules sought to minimize venting and flaring of emissions from storage tanks and other equipment, and also impose leak detection and repair requirements. However, due to subsequent BLM revisions and multiple legal challenges, the rules were never fully implemented, and in October 2020, the November 2016 rules were struck down by the District Court of Wyoming as the result of one such challenge. New Mexico and California have since filed an appeal of the Wyoming Court's decision in the Tenth Circuit. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This \u201cParis Agreement\u201d was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions. Nevertheless, President Biden has set ambitious targets for GHG reduction, including to achieve at least a 50 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG pollution by 2030.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. ESG goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling, and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Potential disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nRestrictions on drilling or other operational activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species and their habitats could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation or conservation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and of entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. In December 2016, the CFTC re-proposed regulations implementing limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules also will require us, in connection with certain derivatives activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements). In addition, the CFTC and certain banking regulators have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception to the mandatory clearing, trade-execution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, if any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flow. It is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us or the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on us, our financial condition or our results of operations.\nFuture federal, state or local legislation also may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction or production.\nFuture changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, or the introduction of a carbon tax, as well as any similar changes in state law, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, future legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes or fees imposed on oil and natural gas extraction or production. Any such legislation could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nAnti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the use and operation of our systems, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming have\nenacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate may change in the future, which could adversely impact us.\nThe TCJA significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions and certain deductions for executive compensation, permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, and revising the rules governing net operating losses. The TCJA remains unclear in some respects and continues to be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections. The United States Treasury Department and the IRS have issued significant guidance since the TCJA was enacted, interpreting the TCJA and clarifying some of the uncertainties, and are continuing to issue new guidance. There are still significant aspects of the TCJA for which further guidance is expected, and both the timing and contents of any such future guidance are uncertain.\nFurther, changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws are proposed regularly and there can be no assurance that, if enacted, any such changes would not have an adverse impact on us. For example, President Biden has suggested the reversal or modification of some portions of the TCJA and certain of these proposals, if enacted, could increase our effective tax rate. There can be no assurance that any such proposed changes will be introduced as legislation or, if introduced, later enacted, and, if enacted, what form such enacted legislation would take. Such changes could potentially have retroactive effect.\nIn light of these factors, there can be no assurance that our effective income tax rate will not change in future periods. If the effective tax rate were to increase as a result of the future legislation, our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve estimates;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, and financial indicators, such as net income, cash flow and revenues;\n\u2022our failure to meet revenue, reserves or earnings estimates by research analysts or other investors;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by the Company or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022strategic actions by our competitors or competition for, among other things, capital, acquisition of reserves, undeveloped land and skilled personnel;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry generally;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022increases in market interest rates or funding rates, which may increase our cost of capital;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022actions by our stockholders;\n\u2022commencement or involvement in litigation;\n\u2022general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022political conditions in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022the realization of any risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIf we fail to continue to meet the requirements for continued listing on the NYSE American stock exchange, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is listed for quotation on the NYSE American and we are required to meet specified financial requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital, a minimum price per share, a minimum public float, and continued business operations so that we are not delisted or characterized as a \u201cpublic shell company.\u201d If we are unable to comply with the NYSE American stock exchange\u2019s listing standards, NYSE may determine to delist our common stock from the NYSE American stock exchange or other of NYSE\u2019s trading markets. If our common stock is delisted for any reason, it could reduce the value of our common stock and liquidity.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash to support any dividend to our common stockholders.\nThe amount of any dividend will depend on the amount of cash we generate from operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce;\n\u2022market prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and their effect on our drilling and development plan;\n\u2022the levels of our operating expenses, maintenance expenses and general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022regulatory action affecting:\n\u2022the supply of, or demand for, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022our operating costs or our operating flexibility;\n\u2022prevailing economic conditions; and\n\u2022adverse weather conditions.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for dividends will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022our ability to borrow under our debt agreements to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenditures and to pay dividends;\n\u2022fluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022restrictions on dividends contained in any of our debt agreements;\n\u2022the cost of acquisitions, if any; and\n\u2022other business risks affecting our cash levels.\nOur quarterly cash dividends, if any, may vary significantly both quarterly and annually.\nInvestors who are looking for an investment that will pay regular and predictable quarterly dividends should not invest in our common stock. Our business performance may be more volatile, and our cash flow may be less stable, than other business models that pay dividends. The amount of our quarterly dividends will generally depend on the performance of our business, which has a limited operating history.\nThe board of directors may modify or revoke our dividend policy at any time at its discretion.\nWe are not required to pay any dividends on our common stock at all. Accordingly, the board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to pay dividends on our common stock for one or more quarters. Any modification or revocation of our cash dividend policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of dividends to our common stockholders. The amount of dividends we make, if any, and the decision to make any dividend at all will be determined by our board of directors, whose interests may differ from those of our common stockholders.\nThe amount of cash we have available for dividends to our common stockholders depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on our profitability, which may prevent us from paying dividends, even during periods in which we record net income.\nThe amount of cash we have available for dividends depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on our profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash dividends during periods when we record a net loss for financial accounting purposes and, conversely, we might fail to pay cash dividends on our common stock during periods when we record net income for financial accounting purposes.\nDelaware law imposes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nOur common stockholders do not have a right to dividends on such shares unless declared or set aside for payment by our board of directors. Under Delaware law, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus\u201d or, if there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d from the corporation\u2019s net profits for the then-current or the preceding fiscal year. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock would require the availability of adequate \u201csurplus,\u201d which is defined as the excess, if any, of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over capital. Our business may not generate sufficient surplus or net profits from operations to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future, or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which could result in a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs of our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we had not designed an effective financial reporting process and did not complete thorough reviews of financial reports in a timely manner to allow for an appropriate level of analysis that would have identified these errors. These\nerrors principally related to (i) accounting for stock-based compensation and our failure to record compensation expense for certain vested stock-based compensation grants in the correct reporting period, (ii) accounting for dividend distributions and our failure to record a declared dividend in the reporting period in which the dividend was declared, (iii) accounting for derivative settlements, and (iv) controls over preparation and review of the Company\u2019s statement of cash flows were not effective. While the material weaknesses have been remediated as of September 30,2021, we cannot provide assurance that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in future periods or that we will be successful in remediating any future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Consequently, if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies occur in the future, it could affect the financial results that we report which could result in a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including, among other things, an exemption from the requirement to present five years of selected financial data, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and being subject to simplified executive compensation disclosures. Until such time as we cease to be a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d such reduced disclosure in our SEC filings may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nRisks Related to the Company\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected if we lose key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our officers, including Bobby Riley, our Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Riley, our President, Philip Riley, our Chief Financial Officer, Corey Riley, our Executive Vice President - Business Intelligence, and Michael Palmer, our Executive Vice President Corporate - Land. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties and developing and executing financing strategies. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any management personnel. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to retain and utilize skilled technical\npersonnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, in the aggregate, own 80.1% of the fully diluted common stock of the Company. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, as well as the Company\u2019s management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would control or significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other changes in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of the management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022after a certain date, limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to the board of directors;\n\u2022after a certain date, require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by written consent;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022authorize the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a shareholder rights plan, or so-called \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by the board of directors; and\n\u2022after a certain date, require the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the votes that all the stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by Company\u2019s directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to the Company or its stockholders, any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nThese provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company\u2019s and its directors, officers, employees or stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions in our\nbylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and certain of our stockholders and their respective affiliates, including their funds and their respective portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities.\nInvestment funds managed by certain of our stockholders are in the business of making investments in entities in the U.S. energy industry. As a result, certain of our stockholders may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers. Certain of our stockholders and their respective portfolio companies may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Under our certificate of incorporation, certain of our stockholders and/or one or more of their respective affiliates are permitted to engage in business activities or invest in or acquire businesses which may compete with our business or do business with any client of ours. Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with respect to the foregoing could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87471, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TGC"}
