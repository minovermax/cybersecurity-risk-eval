{"cik": "861878", "company": "STERICYCLE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nOur consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Form 10-K. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nBUSINESS, STRATEGY AND MARKET RISKS\nOur business is subject to risks arising from pandemic diseases, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA significant outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in any geographic area in which we operate could result in a health crisis adversely affecting the economies, financial markets and overall demand for our services in such areas. In addition, any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in response to a health crisis, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, or facility closures, may interfere with the ability of our employees and vendors to perform their responsibilities. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe continued global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions, including vaccination requirements, that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers\u2019 demand for our services; our ability to provide our services; the ability of our customers to pay for our services; any closures of our and our customers\u2019 facilities; and the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other measures taken in an attempt to counteract future outbreaks in our or our customers\u2019 facilities. In addition, while governments around the world have enacted emergency relief programs designed to combat the economic impact of the pandemic, the long-term effect of such spending is uncertain and could result in future budgetary restrictions for our government clients. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. During 2021, we experienced higher than normal driver absences due to the effects of COVID-19.\nLong-term remote work arrangements may adversely affect our business.\nMany of our team members are currently working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cyber-security risks, impair the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and impact our ability to manage our business.\nMeasures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus may adversely affect our business.\nThe continued spread of the COVID-19 virus, an economic slowdown attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our supply chain, make us more reliant on third party providers, result in disruption in transportation services and restrictions on the ability of our team members to travel, result in temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers, cause certain of our customers and suppliers to become insolvent or permanently cease operations affect the volume of paper which is processed by our secure information destruction business and the revenue generated from the sale of SOP, decrease the amount of paper collected per stop by our secure information destruction business, result in an increase in the volume of COVID-related waste and require increased use of third parties to handle such waste, and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also be required to cover certain costs related to team members who are quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted or may disrupt implementation and timing of our ERP system and certain of our internal business plans and strategies.\nMarket conditions could adversely change and our earnings could decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in charges to impair intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nWe evaluate on an ongoing basis whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment to the value of indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships and goodwill. As circumstances\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 20\nPART I\nafter an acquisition can change, we may not realize the value of these intangible assets. We may be required to recognize impairments in certain of our reporting units due to a reduction of forecasted future cash flows associated with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Further, we could experience higher customer attrition as certain customers cease or reduce operations. The recognition of any potential future impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nChanging market conditions in the healthcare industry, healthcare consolidation and healthcare reform, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWithin the U.S. and elsewhere, the healthcare industry is evolving to meet competing demands for increased healthcare coverage of a growing and aging population and economic pressures to reduce healthcare costs. As a result of these dynamics, hospital networks are consolidating physician practices into their networks, independent practices are consolidating together, and healthcare providers are focused on cutting costs within their businesses. These changes exert downward pricing pressure, including the impact of GPO rebates and administrative fees, on services that we provide to healthcare customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe industries in which we participate are highly competitive. This competition has required us in the past to reduce our prices to our customers, may require us to reduce our prices in the future or may affect our ability to increase prices in the future. We may elect to exit or not participate in low margin customer relationships. Price reductions or our inability to increase prices could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face direct competition from a large number of small, local competitors. Because it requires very little financial investment to compete in the collection and transportation of regulated wastes or the secure destruction of personal and confidential information, there are many regional and local companies in these industries. We face competition from these businesses, and competition from them is likely to exist in new locations to which we may expand in the future. We may also face competition from competitors employing new or alternative technologies. In addition, large national companies with substantial resources and companies funded by private equity firms operate in the markets we serve.\nFluctuations in the commodity market related to the demand and price for recycled paper affects our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell nearly all of the shredded paper from our secure information destruction business to paper companies and recycled paper brokers. Sorted office paper is marketed as a commodity and is subject to significant demand and price fluctuations beyond our control. Historically, economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices, volume, revenues, and margins for pulp and paper products. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. The overall levels of demand for the pulp and paper products reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide. We have experienced a decline in paper tonnage collected over the past two years which we believe is a reduction in the consumption of paper due to pandemic related impacts, such as a shift to remote work and virtual learning, and it remains unclear what the future long-term impact will be on the paper volume we collect. The market demand for recycled paper can be volatile due to factors beyond our control. Lack of demand for our shredded paper material could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable market conditions, including those driven by economic or social trends, may impact the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information we collect from customers.\nThe compliance-based services we provide rely on the generation of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information by our customers. The volume of material collected from our customers may be impacted by macro-economic trends associated with manufacturing and industrial markets, healthcare market dynamics, and trends associated with an increase in work-from-home arrangements and electronic and digital record keeping. Many of our services are provided on a subscription basis with a monthly fee to minimize short-term or cyclical variability associated with these factors. However, some of our services are provided on a transactional basis, and long-term\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 21\nPART I\ntrends resulting from these factors could reduce the demand for our services, whether we provide them on a subscription or transactional basis.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which is frequently difficult, expensive, and time-consuming with which to comply; noncompliance could adversely affect our operations and efforts to grow our business results.\nThe regulated waste management and secure information destruction industries are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection, transportation, packaging, labeling, handling, documentation, reporting, treatment and disposal of regulated waste and the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information. Our business requires us to obtain many permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates, and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Federal, state and local laws and regulations change often, and new requirements are frequently adopted. Changes in applicable laws and regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate our business.\nWe might be unable to obtain or maintain the permits that we require, and/or the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant. Many of the permits that we require, especially those to build and operate waste processing plants and transfer facilities, are difficult and time-consuming to obtain and they may not be issued as quickly as we need them or be issued at all. They may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently. If we cannot obtain the permits, or if they contain unfavorable conditions, it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues and/or profitability. The Company is party to legal or administrative proceedings regarding obtaining and maintaining permits, or alleged violations of existing permit terms and related requirements. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data --Note 19 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we encounter regulatory compliance issues in the course of operating our businesses, we may experience adverse publicity, which may intensify if such non-compliance results in civil or criminal liability. This adverse publicity may harm our reputation, and result in difficulties in attracting new customers, or retaining existing customers.\nThe level of governmental enforcement of regulated waste and certain other regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services.\nWe believe that strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to regulated waste collection, treatment and disposal and the handling and protection of personal and confidential information, can have a positive effect on our business, as these laws and regulations may increase the demand for our services. Relaxation of enforcement, government shutdowns, or other changes in governmental regulation of regulated waste and personal and confidential information could increase the number of competitors we face or reduce or delay the need for our services.\nComplications with the implementation of our ERP system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of an ERP system implementation, which will replace most of our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team related to the operation of our business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing increased costs and other difficulties and our planned timeline to implement the remaining phases of our ERP system may be delayed. If we are unable to successfully implement our ERP system as planned, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively impacted. The SID North America ERP deployment impacted revenue in the third quarter of 2021. This decline was due to typical ERP start-up challenges, which included team members learning new processes and technology across every aspect of the business and onboarding and tuning the flow of data elements through the system. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to adequately assess those controls could be delayed.\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 22\nPART I\nAttacks on our information technology systems could damage our reputation, negatively impact our businesses and expose us to litigation risk.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our team members and our customers. We rely heavily on various proprietary and third-party information systems. Our reputation for the secure handling of customer and other sensitive information is critical to the success of our business. Like other large, multi-national corporations, we are potentially subject to a range of cyber incidents, including but not limited to state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, data leakage and compromise, wire fraud, phishing incidents and other cyber incidents. We previously experienced an incident of phishing activity targeting certain Stericycle employee email accounts and determined that some of these employee email accounts containing personal information appear to have been accessed by one or more unauthorized parties. We found no evidence that any personal information contained in these accounts was itself accessed by an unauthorized party. In an abundance of caution, we notified, and offered identity protection services, to relevant individuals. In any cyber incident that we experience, our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be entirely effective as our information technology and network infrastructure may still be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, computer viruses, power outages, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, breaches with respect to third-party systems or other disruptions. A cybersecurity incident and breach of our information systems could lead to theft, destruction, misappropriation or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, which could result in business disruption, negative publicity, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, brand damage, adverse financial and operational results, and potential litigation. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there is no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nOur management depends on relevant and reliable information for decision-making purposes, including key performance indicators and financial reporting. Any significant loss of data, failure to maintain reliable data, disruptions affecting our information systems, or delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our businesses without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. If our information systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nThe handling of secure information for destruction exposes us to potential data security risks that could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment in the regions in which we operate regarding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and regularly changing requirements. Certain legislation, including FACTA, HIPAA, the Economic Espionage Act in the U.S., the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada and the GDPR in the U.K. and EU, require documents to be securely destroyed to avoid identity theft and inadvertent disclosure of confidential and sensitive information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or other company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost revenues, fines, or lawsuits. In addition, an increasing number of countries and states in the U.S. have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws or are expected to do so. The continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request us to take additional measures to enhance security and/or assume higher liability under our contracts. As a result of legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations to further improve data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operational complexity, and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and reduce our earnings.\nWe maintain an extensive transportation network and fleet of vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for trucks or fuel could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 23\nPART I\nmargins and reported earnings. Parts shortages due to a reduction in the availability of raw materials, supply chain challenges, and manufacturing delays are expected to continue to drive higher prices for parts and supplies. In addition, any increases in the prices of fossil fuels are expected to put pressure on our fuel expense, as well as parts and supplies derived from fossil fuels, such as engine oil, diesel exhaust fluid, tires and other rubber and plastic parts.\nRisks from our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have established operations in the U.S. and 16 other countries. Foreign operations carry specific risks including: (i) exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; (ii) substantial inflation in certain markets; (iii) dependence in certain markets on government entities as customers; (iv) delays in the collection of accounts receivable related to certain government funding practices; (v) government controls; (vi) import and export license requirements; (vii) political or economic instability, social unrest, and public safety and security; (viii) changes in or compliance with U.S., local or other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery (i.e. FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar laws), global trade, trade sanctions, competition, privacy and data protection; (ix) trade restrictions; (x) changes in tariffs and taxes; (xi) tax and foreign investment policies; (xii) industry or macro-economic trends; (xiii) permitting and regulatory standards; (xiv) differences in local laws, regulations, practices, and business customs; (xv) restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the U.S. or movement of funds to other countries; (xvi) difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; (xvii) increases and volatility in labor costs; (xviii) property ownership restrictions in certain countries; and (xix) emerging trends or regulations related to reducing the impact of climate change. Any of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe face continuing risks relating to compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nOn June 12, 2017, the SEC issued a subpoena to us, requesting documents and information relating to our compliance with the FCPA or other foreign or domestic anti-corruption laws with respect to certain of our operations in Latin America. In addition, the DOJ notified us that it is investigating this matter in parallel with the SEC. We are cooperating with these agencies and certain foreign authorities, and also have conducted an internal investigation of these and other matters, including outside of Latin America, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the assistance of outside counsel, and this investigation has found evidence of improper conduct. We have entered into settlement discussions with the SEC, DOJ, and Brazilian authorities with respect to the foregoing matters, and although we have reached agreements in principle with the DOJ and with the SEC, those agreements remain to be finalized and approved. The settlement discussions with the Brazilian authorities are ongoing and there is no certainty that we will be able to reach a settlement. As a result of the foregoing, we recorded an aggregate accrued liability for these matters of $80.7 million as of December 31, 2021. These matters (and other matters which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including in the pending resolutions with the DOJ and SEC. Such determinations could subject us to, among other things, enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ or other regulatory bodies, fines, penalties, oversight by an independent compliance monitor and/or self-reporting obligations, litigation, or orders of suspension or debarment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.\nWe are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits and may be named as a defendant in future lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 24\nPART I\nindebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 19 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to extensive government imposed requirements; noncompliance could result in significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The consequences of failure to comply with government-imposed regulations and other requirements can impact our ability to service our customers, and thus our operational results. Compliance with government regulations can also be costly, which impacts our overall financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of business we are routinely involved in various government enforcement proceedings, private lawsuits and other disputes alleging non-compliance with applicable regulation. Such matters can result in permit revocations or denials, civil penalties or other obligations that may require significant expenditures.\nDue to the nature of regulated waste services, we face risk associated with potential regulation of emerging contaminants that may have been present in materials historically collected for treatment and disposal. Further, there is risk of incurring significant environmental cleanup liabilities that arise due to our current operations, pre-existing conditions at the locations where we operate, and/or successor or predecessor liability associated with our portfolio optimization strategy.\nTax interpretations and changes in tax regulations and legislation could adversely affect us.\nTax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the applicable taxation authorities upon audit. Furthermore, as a result of portfolio optimization efforts through which we may acquire new assets or businesses, sell existing assets or businesses, or exit particular markets, there may exist tax rules, regulations, or other matters that may be the focus of examination and challenge by applicable taxation authorities. Similarly, we may periodically restructure our legal entities and if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. In connection with such portfolio optimization, we could also incur additional charges associated with consulting fees and other charges.\nIn response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding government relief efforts, legislatures and taxing authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect, and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be significant. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the CARES Act. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits. The CARES Act is highly detailed, and we will continue to assess the impact that various provisions will have on our business.\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed the CAA 2021, which provides several business tax relief provisions, including (i) extension of the CFC look-through rule through 2025, (ii) a temporary 100% deduction for business meals paid or incurred in 2021 and 2022, and (iii) extension of the WOTC through 2025. We will continue to assess the CAA 2021 with respect to the provisions that have an impact on our business.\nFurther, on March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the ARP Act, a legislative package which is generally not significant to the Company\u2019s current tax footprint. We will continue to assess the ARP Act on an ongoing basis.\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 25\nPART I\nWe have accumulated NOLs arising from our operations and foreign and domestic acquisitions of $281.6 million as of December 31, 2021. We have recognized valuation allowances to reduce these amounts to our current estimate for NOLs that will be recoverable against future taxable income prior to their expiration in accordance with the appropriate tax regulations. If our estimates change or we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these NOLs, we may have to record additional valuation allowances resulting in higher income tax expense. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 10 - Income Taxes.\nRequirements of governments, customers and investors for net carbon zero emissions strategies, and the introduction of regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d aimed to limit climate change, could negatively impact our costs to operate.\nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), which reaffirmed the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, has increased focus on sustainability matters. Even prior to COP26, many of our customers have established goals for their organizations to be carbon neutral or reduce waste levels, especially wastes that go to landfills, and have extended such goals to their key vendors and business partners. For example, the National Health System (NHS) in the U.K. established a goal for its suppliers to be net zero by 2045, and, in September 2021, the NHS announced that all suppliers of goods and services with NHS contracts commencing April 2024 will be required to publish a carbon reduction plan for their direct emissions. Additionally, many investors and financial institutions believe that climate change will significantly influence many companies\u2019 long-term prospects and are requesting climate change disclosures and commitments from their investments.\nAround the world, there are also a wide range of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, provincial, regional and federal levels focused on reducing greenhouse gas emission and minimizing the impact of climate change. These emerging legislative and regulatory efforts include, among other things, initiatives to reduce the use of fossil fuels, single use plastics, and waste volumes sent to landfills. In California, several county and municipal governments have introduced zero waste to landfill goals; at least one customer has not renewed RWCS service in order to pursue options that avoid landfills. We actively monitor the regulatory landscape and the potential impacts to our operations of such efforts. These evolving regulations and expectations could also affect certain management estimates, including long-lived asset useful lives and asset retirement obligations, which could adversely impact results of operations.\nThe increased focus on minimizing climate change from customers, investors, and regulatory bodies may impact our revenues as well as our cost of operations in the future.\nFINANCIAL AND CONTROL RISKS\nWe may incur significant charges as a result of portfolio optimization; portfolio optimization may not achieve the desired results.\nWe continue to evaluate the performance of our portfolio of assets and businesses. Based on this evaluation, we may acquire new assets or businesses and may sell certain existing assets or businesses or exit particular markets. Acquisitions and divestitures may not yield the targeted improvements in our business. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key team members, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities, including pursuant to indemnification provisions related to the divested business. Any charges, including those arising from indemnification provisions, that we are required to record or the failure to achieve the intended financial results associated with divestitures of businesses or assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any impairments and losses on divestiture resulting from this process may cause us to record significant charges, including those related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and accumulated currency translation adjustment losses. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 4 - Restructuring, Divestitures, and Impairments in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions also involve certain risks, including our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies and other benefits expected from an acquisition, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, difficulties in retaining key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired business, difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures throughout acquired companies, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers and suppliers. We may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 26\nPART I\nfrom the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 3 - Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRestrictions in our Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions and the value of our securities.\nOur Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements; certain financial covenants; notices of default and certain other material events; payment of obligations; preservation of corporate existence, rights, privileges, permits, licenses, franchises and intellectual property; maintenance of property and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of liens, investments and indebtedness; mergers and certain other fundamental changes; dispositions of assets; restricted payments; changes in our line of business; transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business, increase the amount of interest expense we ultimately pay pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our Senior Notes also contain certain covenants that could have a similar effect on our ability to operate our business. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 9 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement, along with certain of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Senior Notes, may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with these provisions could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, foreclose against any assets securing the debt under our Credit Agreement and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our stock could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nServicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, on future operating performance, general economic conditions, competition, and litigation, legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business.\nSome of these factors are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nPotential for rising interest rates.\nThe financial markets may experience an increase in interest rates as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in an effort to curb inflation. Although most of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates, an increase in rates would impact our variable rate debt. Rising interest rates may also lead to higher rates in the event we refinance our outstanding fixed rate debt thereby resulting in an overall increase in interest expense.\nThe amount of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $1.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including long-term debt and short-term debt and excluding unamortized debt issuance costs. We also have the ability to incur additional indebtedness subject to our financial covenants.\nOur leverage could have adverse consequences on our business, including the following: (i) we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our available cash to payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, (ii)\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 27\nPART I\nour ability to access credit markets on terms we deem acceptable may be impaired, and (iii) we may be limited in our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, including increased risk associated with our ERP implementation, we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our company, our results of operations and our stock price.\nInternal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We are implementing remedial measures and new systems and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. These measures will result in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nMarket conditions could adversely change and our earnings could decline resulting in charges to impair intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nAs a result of our various acquisitions, the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 contains goodwill of $2.8 billion and other intangible assets, net of $964.5 million. We evaluate on an ongoing basis whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment to the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets such as goodwill. As circumstances after an acquisition can change, we may not realize the value of these intangible assets. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $6.7 million, $11.1 million, and $17.7 million, respectively, of operating permits, tradenames, and customer relationships. Additionally, in 2019 we recognized $228.3 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our reporting units. We recognized these impairments due to a reduction of forecasted future cash flows in each reporting unit, as discussed in the Impairment section of Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The recognition of any potential future impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe participate in multi-employer pension plans administered by employer and union trustees. To the extent that those plans are underfunded, ERISA may subject us to substantial liabilities in the event we, whether partially or totally, cease to have obligations to contribute to the plans. Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, circumstances such as a plan's termination, an employer's partial or complete withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from, an underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan can trigger our obligation to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi-employer plan's unfunded vested liabilities. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as \"endangered\", \"seriously endangered\", or \"critical\" status. If plans in which we participate are in critical status or underfunded, we could be required to make additional contributions.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of March 30, 2021, one of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate is underfunded. The Pension Protection Act requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We have been notified that one plan is in \"critical\" status and this plan may require additional contributions. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will be based on future levels of employee work that require the specific use of the union team members covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans. Additional funding could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations. For more information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 13 - Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 28\nPART I\nSome of our customers have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe provide service to a number of customers, including governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us, resulting in increased bad debt expense, or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased prices could negatively affect our operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL\nA change or deterioration in our relations with our team members or an increase in labor and employment costs could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor and employment is one of our highest costs and increases in employment costs could materially affect our cost structure and our profitability. We compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified team members and the labor supply is sometimes tight in our markets. A shortage of qualified team members or further unionization would require us to incur additional costs related to wages and benefits; inefficiencies in operations; unanticipated costs in sourcing temporary or third-party labor; legal fees and interference with customer relationships. Due primarily to increased demand for truck drivers and competition from other employers, we are experiencing difficulties hiring a sufficient number of qualified truck drivers. If this condition persists, it could affect our ability to service our customers and affect our results of operations.\nWe are a party to 13 collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and Canada, covering approximately 500 team members, or approximately 4.6% of our total U.S. and Canadian workforce and further agreements and works councils covering approximately 1,500 team members in our other international locations. These agreements expire on a scheduled basis depending upon the negotiated length of the contract\u2019s term. Collective bargaining agreement negotiations occur every year depending upon which agreements expire and whether one or both parties seek the modification of terms.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of future agreements with unions in a manner acceptable to us. There is also no guarantee that current non-union team members will not seek union representation resulting in additional collective bargaining agreements with associated increased costs to us. Potential work disruptions from labor disputes may disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our brand, customer relations, financial condition, and results of operations. During 2021 the Company experienced a total of four work stoppages at its facilities as a result of labor disputes.\nThe handling, transportation, and treatment of regulated waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to team members and others.\nOur business requires our team members to handle materials that may be infectious or hazardous to life and property in other ways. While we try to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, and spills (including those caused by natural disasters) always exists. Examples of incidents that may present possible exposure to contaminated or infectious waste or other hazardous materials include truck accidents, damaged or leaking containers, improper storage of regulated waste, placement of prohibited materials into the waste stream, or malfunctioning plant equipment, such as power outages, or ineffective backup systems.\nHuman beings or animals could be injured or sickened or property could be damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us.\nWhile we generally carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\nAn inability to retain key personnel or difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel may adversely affect our business.\n2021 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. \u2022 29\nPART I\nThe labor market in the U.S. and globally is very competitive. Like many other route-based businesses, we are being impacted by our industry\u2019s driver and facility team member shortages. We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. We must hire, train and develop effective drivers and other team members. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. In addition, employee turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our business. Difficulty in replacing or adding personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention, or hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nIncreasing occurrences of natural disasters or other catastrophic events caused by climate change or otherwise could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities or equipment, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, and the temporary disruption in transportation services which we rely on to deliver waste to our facilities. These events could prevent or delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Weather conditions and other event driven special projects may also cause variations in our results. We may be required to suspend operations in some of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we have protocols in place for operating regions frequently impacted by severe weather changes, continued climate change may require additional protocols, processes, physical equipment, and training to minimize risks to team members, physical property, and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflationary cost environment and supply chain disruption.\nDuring 2021, we experienced inflationary cost increases in our underlying expenses, including labor, supply chain related, and other expenses. We may continue to experience inflationary cost increases in labor, commodities, facility and vehicle leases, third party expenditures, plant equipment and construction expenditures, and other expenses. We may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to our customers. We are also experiencing delays in completing certain capital projects and have additional challenges due to macroeconomic supply chain disruptions. Should these conditions persist, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 83906, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "SRCL"}
