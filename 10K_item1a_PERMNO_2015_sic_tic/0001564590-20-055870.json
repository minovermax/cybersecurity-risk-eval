RISK FACTORS.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in business from, one or more of our major customers could significantly reduce our revenue, earnings or other operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. Two of our customers each provided more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2020. Revenue from Abbott and Medtronic represented approximately 19% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue for fiscal 2020 and was generated from multiple products and fields of use. The loss of Medtronic, Abbott or any of our other largest customers, or reductions in business from them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. There can be no assurance that revenue from any customer will continue at their historical levels. If we cannot broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and is expected to continue to have further adverse effects, which could be material, on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in financial markets. We have implemented business policies intended to protect our employees from the spread of COVID-19. Those policies include employees working from home when possible, but the majority of our employees have continued to work from our facilities, where we have adopted health screening, implemented socially distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modified workspaces to reduce the potential for disease transmission, which have involved additional costs to us.\nOn March 18, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) released guidance for U.S. healthcare providers to limit non-emergent elective medical procedures other than high acuity treatments in order to conserve personal protective equipment and limit exposure to COVID-19. On April 16, 2020, the White House issued \u201cGuidelines for Opening Up America Again\u201d (the \u201cWhite House Guidelines\u201d) that described a phased resumption of economic activities with gating conditions for a region or state to move from one phase to another. On June 9, 2020, CMS issued recommendations for regions and states in Phase II of the White House Guidelines that non-emergent, non-COVID-19 care should be offered to patients, as clinically appropriate, in localities or facilities that have the resources to provide such care, as well as the ability to quickly respond to a surge in COVID-19 cases, if necessary.\nSince the White House Guidelines and related CMS recommendations were issued, rates of COVID-19 have vacillated by region and state, in many cases surging in the fall of 2020. Accordingly, consistent with the CMS recommendations, the degree to which elective medical procedures have been offered varies by region, state, and even between healthcare systems within a state. Where elective procedures have been offered, and even for emergency procedures, some people appear to have avoided healthcare facilities, presumably out of concern for contracting COVID-19. Many of our customers use our licensed technology and purchased materials to manufacture products used in procedures impacted by the guidance and recommendations. Based on the CMS guidance and recommendations, as well as industry data regarding elective procedures volumes, we adjusted the assumptions used in our royalties revenue recognition for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, which reduced royalty revenue in these periods relative to the revenue that would have been recognized under our prior assumptions. We currently understand that elective procedures volumes were higher in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 than we originally estimated, resulting in a net favorable impact to revenue recognized in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. In the quarter ended September 30, 2020, our royalty revenue reflected our understanding and assumptions of procedure volumes through the end of the period. We continue to believe that elective procedure volumes were lower in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 than they would have been absent the pandemic. In addition to limiting medical procedures, hospitals and other healthcare providers vary in the degree to which they are permitting access to their facilities during the pandemic.\nIn early July 2020, we suspended production for one week in one production work cell in our facility in Eden Prairie when one of the employees in the cell was identified as having COVID-19. The production suspension did not have a material impact on our operations and the cell has since resumed normal operations. From time to time, we have had employees test positive for COVID-19. In such instances, we have instructed employees who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who have had recent exposure to another individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, to avoid coming into our facilities for a quarantine period recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWe cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic, actions that governments and businesses may take in response to the pandemic, or the impacts of the pandemic on healthcare systems. The impacts of the pandemic may include, but not be limited to:\n\u2022\nReduced revenues from our customers, including our major customers, whose products are impacted by reductions in the delivery of elective medical procedures or patients\u2019 unwillingness to visit healthcare facilities for medical procedures;\n\u2022\nDiminished ability or willingness of third parties to market, distribute and sell products incorporating our coating and device technologies, as well as our whole-product solutions, due to reduced demand from, or lack of access to, healthcare facilities and providers;\n\u2022\nDiminished ability, or inability, to complete clinical trials and other activities required to achieve regulatory clearance of our products under development due to lack of access to healthcare facilities, healthcare providers and patients;\n\u2022\nDiminished or lost access to third-party service providers that we use in our research and development or marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nLoss of manufacturing capacity, which could lead to failures to meet product delivery commitments, or increased operating costs if our facilities were to experience additional incidents of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nReduced cash flow from our operations due to reductions in revenues or collections from our customers and increases in operating costs related to actions we have taken in response to the pandemic;\n\u2022\nReduced business productivity due to inefficiencies in employees working from home or increasing physical distancing and other pandemic response protocols in our production facilities;\n\u2022\nIncreased susceptibility to the risk of information technology security breaches and other disruptions due to increased volumes of remote access to our information systems from our employees working at home;\n\u2022\nInability to source sufficient components used in our products due to disruptions in supply chains;\n\u2022\nDiminished ability to identify, evaluate and acquire, or effectively integrate, complementary businesses, products, materials or technologies due to travel restrictions, physical distancing protocols, and lack of access to third party service providers related to our development activities;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in assessing and securing intellectual property rights due to lack of access to, or delayed responsiveness of, third-party service providers or governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nImpairment of goodwill or other assets due to reductions in the fair value of our reporting units;\n\u2022\nDiminished ability to retain personnel over concerns about workplace exposure to COVID-19, or to hire and effectively train new personnel, due to physical distancing protocols; and\n\u2022\nIncreased volatility in our stock price due to financial market instability.\nThese and other factors relating to, or arising from, the pandemic could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and capital investments. Actual or anticipated adverse effects on our cash flows or financial condition may lead us to seek additional funding. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or otherwise curtail our operations. Any of these events could materially harm our business and operating results.\nThe long-term success of our business may suffer if we are unable to expand our licensing base.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy of licensing our coatings technologies to a diverse array of medical device companies, thereby expanding the commercialization opportunities for our technologies. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customer devices used in connection with procedures in cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, structural heart and other applications. As a result, our business is susceptible to adverse trends in procedures. Further, we may also be subject to adverse trends in specific markets such as the cardiovascular industry, including declines in procedures using our customers\u2019 products as well as declines in average selling prices from which we earn royalties. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new licensees, to enter into agreements for additional applications with existing licensees, and to develop technologies for use in new applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, develop and adapt our technologies for new applications in a timely and cost-effective manner; that new license agreements will be executed on terms favorable to us; that new applications will be accepted by customers in our target markets; or that products incorporating newly licensed technology, including new applications, will gain regulatory approval, be commercialized or gain market acceptance. Delays or failures in these efforts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.\nWe operate in a competitive and evolving field, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products in the fields of surface modification, device drug delivery, medical device products and diagnostics. Our surface modification coating technologies compete with technologies developed by a number of other companies. In addition, many medical device manufacturers have developed, or are engaged in efforts to develop, surface modification coating technologies for use on their own products, particularly in the area of drug delivery. With respect to commercialization of our whole-product solutions, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, competitive pricing pressures from larger OEM suppliers, as well as some of our largest medical device partners that have in-house resources that produce similar products. Some of our existing and potential competitors (especially medical device manufacturers pursuing coating solutions through their own R&D efforts) have greater financial and technical resources as well as production and marketing capabilities than us. Further, even if we are successful with respect to our plan to develop new medical device products, the commercialization of these products may be dependent upon a commercial partner to effectively market and sell our products to end users. Competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before us. Products incorporating our competitors\u2019 technologies may gain market acceptance more rapidly than products using our technologies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that new products or technologies developed by others, or the emergence of new industry standards, will not render our products or technologies or licensees\u2019 products incorporating our technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Any new technologies that make our surface modification coating, medical device platforms or In Vitro Diagnostics technologies less competitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition in the diagnostics market is highly fragmented, and in the product lines in which we compete, we face an array of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Some of our competitors have substantially more capital resources, marketing experience, R&D resources and production facilities than we do.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our whole-product solutions strategy and related important strategic initiatives.\nSince fiscal 2013, we have been focused on a key growth strategy for our Medical Device business by expanding the business to offer whole-product solutions to medical device customers. Our aim is to provide customers with highly differentiated products that address unmet clinical needs. We may seek to market and sell these products to existing customers, through third-party distributors or via other distribution channels.\nSuccessfully implementing our whole-product solutions strategy and related strategic initiatives will place substantial demands on our resources and require, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontinued enhancement of our medical device R&D capabilities, including those needed to support the clinical evaluation and regulatory approval for our whole-product solutions;\n\u2022\neffective coordination and integration of our research facilities and teams, particularly those located in our product development facility in Minnesota and our Irish operations;\n\u2022\nsuccessful hiring and training of personnel;\n\u2022\neffective management of a business geographically located both in the U.S. and Ireland;\n\u2022\ncommercialization of our products, including through strategic partnerships with our medical device customers, third-party distributors, or via other distribution channels;\n\u2022\ncommitment from our medical device customers to market our products effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales;\n\u2022\nsufficient liquidity to support substantial investments in R&D required to make our strategy successful; and\n\u2022\nincreased marketing, field clinical support specialists, and sales-related activities.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our whole-product strategy and related strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which could impact our ability to realize an acceptable return on the investments we are making in connection with this strategy, and may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in operating expenses related to the development and commercialization of new technologies and products may adversely affect our operating results and may not be effective.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our continued development, validation and commercial support of new products and technologies. In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, our R&D expenses increased 29.1% and 28.8%, respectively, over the prior year levels, primarily due to the development of our DCB platform and costs associated with the ongoing TRANSCEND clinical trial for our SurVeil DCB. In fiscal 2020, R&D costs decreased 5.1% from fiscal 2019, representing 53% of our total revenue, primarily due to the progression of the TRANSCEND clinical trial from active enrollment in fiscal 2019 to patient follow-up in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we expect to continue the clinical evaluation of the SurVeil DCB and will conduct additional development and clinical activities for the below-the-knee, AV fistula and other whole-product solutions products, which will result in significant R&D expenses. Our agreement with Abbott provides that we are responsible for conducting all necessary clinical trials and other activities required to achieve U.S. regulatory clearance for the SurVeil DCB, which will continue to involve significant costs.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) increased 18.5% in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2019 and represented 29.9% of our fiscal 2020 revenue. We anticipate that SG&A expenses will continue to increase in fiscal 2021, as we continue to invest in our capacity to support our DCB and other whole-product solutions products. Increases in our operating expenses may materially impact our operating results, including our profitability, in fiscal 2021 and beyond. In addition to the operating expenses associated with product development and commercialization activities, such activities are subject to risks of failure that are inherent in the development and commercialization of new medical technologies or products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new technologies or products, or that any such technologies or products will be commercialized. Even if we are successful in developing and commercializing new technologies or products, there can be no assurance that gross profits from their sales will exceed our operating expenses related to their development and commercialization.\nFailure to identify acquisition opportunities, to accurate financially model the impact of acquisitions, or to integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our operations successfully may limit our growth and adversely impact operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nAn important part of our growth may involve the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies. Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the technology, value, strengths, weaknesses, overall risks and profitability, if any, of acquisition candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to execute acquisitions due to competition from buyers with more resources. If we do not make suitable investments and acquisitions, we may find it more difficult to realize our growth objectives.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of a potential acquisition depends, in part, on the accuracy of our financial model of the anticipate timing and magnitude of cash flows, expenses and revenues related to the acquired business. If the expectations reflected in our financial models for acquisitions are not realized, our operating results, cash flows and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nThe process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations poses numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nan inability to effectively or efficiently integrate acquired operations, personnel, technology, information systems, and internal control systems and products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention, including the need to manage several remote locations with a limited management team;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and uncertainties in transitioning the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entity to us; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees of acquired companies.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may be dilutive to our shareholders\u2019 ownership and/or cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in future significant asset impairment charges. In addition, if we acquire entities that have not yet commercialized products, but rather are developing technologies for future commercialization, our earnings per share may fluctuate as we expend significant funds for continued R&D efforts necessary to commercialize such acquired technology. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.\nOur failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business.\nOur operations are expanding, and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our business strategy. Executing our business strategy has placed significant demands on management and our administrative, development, operational, information technology, manufacturing, financial and personnel resources. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational, development, customer support and financial control systems, and effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. Otherwise, we may not be able to manage our growth successfully.\nGoodwill or other assets on our balance sheet may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet in connection with our acquisitions. As of September 30, 2020, we had $40.5 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet related to our Medical Device and IVD segments, of which $31.8 million related to our Medical Device reporting unit. As required by the accounting guidance for non-amortizing intangible assets, we evaluate at least annually the potential impairment of the goodwill and trademarks. Testing for impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. We also evaluate other assets on our balance sheet, including strategic investments and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the assets may be based on fair value appraisals or discounted cash flow models using various inputs. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million for the impairment of a strategic investment to reduce the carrying value of the investment to zero. Future impairment charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with complex accounting standards, and changes in circumstances or interpretations may lead to accounting adjustments and failure to implement these standards might impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or impact the reliability of our financial reporting.\nOur revenue recognition policies involve application of complex accounting standards, including the determination of when control is transferred to the customer and the allocation of the transaction price to multiple performance obligations. Our compliance with such accounting standards often involves management\u2019s judgment regarding whether the criteria set forth in the standards have been met such that we can recognize as revenue the amounts that we expect to receive as payment for our products or services. We base our judgments on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, these judgments, or the assumptions underlying them, may change over time. In particular, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the performance of medical procedures have made it increasingly challenging to make estimates of sales volumes for medical device products that incorporate our licensed technologies, which estimates we use to determine royalties revenue. In addition, the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) may issue new positions or revised guidance on the treatment of complex accounting matters. Changes in circumstances or third-party guidance could cause our judgments to change with respect to our interpretations of these complex standards, and transactions recorded, including revenue recognized, for one or more prior reporting periods, could be adversely affected.\nOur credit facility contains covenants that restrict our business and financing activities, and the property that secures our obligations under the credit facility may be subject to foreclosure.\nOn September 14, 2020, we entered into a $25 million secured revolving credit facility with Bridgewater Bank pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). The Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants, which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments, create or permit certain liens, create or permit restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, make acquisitions, or consolidate or merge with another entity. The Loan Agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with covenants regarding a minimum level of liquidity; a minimum current ratio; a minimum level of EBITDA, calculated quarterly on the preceding four quarters; and a minimum level of tangible net worth. These provisions impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities, or take other actions that may be in our best interests.\nOur obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property, real estate and foreign assets, including equity in foreign subsidiaries. Our ability to obtain additional or other financing or to dispose of certain assets also could be negatively impacted based on the assets we have pledged as collateral in connection with the Loan Agreement. Our ability to borrow under the Loan Agreement is subject to a borrowing base that equals 80% of the margin value of securities collateral that we have pledged to the lender.\nOur ability to comply with the provisions under the Loan Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and our inability to comply with any of these provisions could result in a default under the Loan Agreement. If such a default occurs, the lender may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, and it would have the right to terminate any commitments it has to provide further funds. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lender under the Loan Agreement also has the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness under that facility. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur business includes foreign operations which exposes us to certain risks related to fluctuations in U.S. dollar and foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company reports its consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars. In a period where the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening relative to the Euro, our revenue and expenses denominated in the Euro are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower or higher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment. As our foreign operations expand, the effects may become material to our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in product mix and increased manufacturing costs could cause our product gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future.\nChanges in our product mix and increases in manufacturing costs could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. These factors, together with the scale-up of our manufacturing operations, particularly in Ireland, adversely affected our gross margin percentage for the last fiscal year and these factors will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2021 and beyond.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS AND RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe rely on third parties to market, distribute and sell most products incorporating our coating and device technologies, as well as our whole-product solutions.\nA principal element of our business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical device and other companies that manufacture products incorporating our technologies. For fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we derived 43%, 48%, and 44%, respectively, of our revenue from royalties and license fees derived from such licensing arrangements. The revenue that we derive from such arrangements depends upon our ability, or our licensees\u2019 ability, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture (if applicable), market, and sell products incorporating our technologies. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our failure, or the failure of our licensees, to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, a licensee could modify their product in such a way that it no longer incorporates our technology. Moreover, under our standard license agreements, licensees can terminate the license for any reason upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice. Existing and potential licensees have no obligation to deal exclusively with us and may pursue parallel development or licensing of competing technologies on their own or with third parties. A decision by a licensee to terminate its relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement with Abbott whereby Abbott will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for the SurVeil DCB. Upon receipt of regulatory approval for the SurVeil DCB, Abbott has the right to purchase commercial units from us and we will realize revenue from product sales to Abbott at an agreed-upon transfer price, as well as a share of net profits resulting from third-party product sales by Abbott. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, we will rely on Abbott to effectively market and sell the SurVeil DCB. If Abbott is unable or unwilling to effectively market and sell the SurVeil DCB, it could have a have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our IVD business relies on distribution agreements and relationships with various third parties, and any adverse change in those relationships could result in a loss of revenue and harm that business.\nWe sell many of our IVD products outside of the U.S. through distributors. Some of our distributors also sell our competitors\u2019 products. If they favor our competitors\u2019 products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide significant sales, which would cause our results to suffer. Additionally, we serve as the exclusive distributor in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico for DIARECT GmbH for its recombinant and native antigens. The success of these arrangements with these third parties depends, in part, on the continued adherence to the terms of our agreements with them. Any disruption in these arrangements will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our customers to accurately report and make payments under our agreements with them.\nWe rely on our customers to determine whether the products that they sell are royalty-bearing and, if so, to report and pay the amount of royalties owed to us under our agreements with them. The majority of our license agreements with our customers give us the right to audit their records to verify the accuracy of their reports to us. However, these audits can be expensive, time-consuming and possibly detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our customers. Inaccuracies in customer royalty reports have resulted in, and could result in, additional overpayments or underpayments of royalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have limited or no redundancy in our manufacturing facilities for certain products, and we may lose revenue and be unable to maintain our customer relationships if we lose our production capacity.\nWe manufacture all of our medical device coating reagents (and provide coating manufacturing services for certain customers) and our IVD products at one of our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities. We also manufacture balloon catheter products at our facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland and catheter-based medical devices in limited quantities in one of our facilities in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. If we receive the necessary FDA regulatory approvals, we plan to manufacture the majority of our whole-product solutions devices in our Ireland facility, including our SurVeil DCB. We plan to maintain secondary, redundant manufacturing capacity for our SurVeil DCB in our manufacturing facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. If our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, we may lose revenue and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers, including certain of our licensees. In addition, because most of our customers use our coating reagents to manufacture their own products that generate royalty revenue for us, failure by us to supply these reagents could result in decreased royalty revenue, as well as decreased revenue from our surface modification coating technologies product sales. Without our existing production facilities, we would have no other means of manufacturing products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at these facilities or develop one or more alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nWe may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or the use or misuse of our products.\nThe development and sale of medical devices and component products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. For medical device products that incorporate our coating technology, most of the licenses provide us with indemnification against such claims. However, there can be no guarantee that product liability claims will not be filed against us for such products, or for medical device products that we manufacture as part of our whole-product solutions strategy, that parties indemnifying us will have the financial ability to honor their indemnification obligations or that such manufacturers will not seek indemnification or other relief from us for any such claims. Any product liability claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. We have obtained a level of liability insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate to our activities, however, we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance covering our costs and losses as a result of any recall of products or devices incorporating our technologies because of alleged defects, whether such recall is instituted by us, by a customer, or is required by a regulatory agency. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities, or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue will be harmed if we cannot purchase sufficient components that we use in our manufacture of reagents.\nWe currently purchase some of the components we use to manufacture reagents from sole suppliers. If any of our sole suppliers becomes unwilling to supply components to us, experiences an interruption in its production, or is otherwise unable to provide us with sufficient material to manufacture our reagents, we will experience production interruptions. If we lose our sole supplier of any particular reagent component or are otherwise unable to procure all components required for our reagent manufacturing for an extended period of time, we may lose the ability to manufacture the reagents our customers require to commercialize products incorporating our technology. This could result in lost royalties and product sales, which would harm our financial results. Adding suppliers to our approved vendor list may require significant time and resources. We routinely attempt to maintain multiple suppliers of each of our significant materials, so we have alternative suppliers, if necessary. However, if the number of suppliers of a material is reduced, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain our material requirements on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our operations may be harmed.\nWe depend upon key personnel and may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future.\nOur success depends upon our ability to retain and attract highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face intense competition for such qualified personnel. We do not maintain key person insurance, and we generally do not enter into employment agreements, except with certain executive officers. Although we have non-compete agreements with most employees, there can be no assurance that such agreements will be enforceable. The loss of the services of one or more key employees or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and our customers expect that we will securely maintain their information. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers resulting from employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any information technology breach could compromise our networks and the information stored on them could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under personal privacy laws and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services that we provide to our customers, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain or protect proprietary rights necessary for the commercialization of our technologies.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and trade secrets. We have been granted U.S. and foreign patents and have U.S. and foreign patent applications pending related to our proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that any pending patent application will be approved, that we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable, that any patents issued will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged or invalidated by third parties, that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies, or that others will not independently develop similar technologies or design around our patents. Furthermore, because we generate a significant amount of our revenue through licensing arrangements, the loss or expiration of patent protection for our licensed technologies will result in a reduction of the revenue derived from these arrangements which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nWe may become involved in expensive and unpredictable patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages, or impair our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success also will depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, and intellectual property litigation may be used against us as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation is complex, time consuming and expensive, and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict. If we were found to be infringing any third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could be required to pay significant damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses from others, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or cease commercialization of our products and processes. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPatent litigation or certain other administrative proceedings may also be necessary to enforce our patents or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. These activities could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome from any such litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using our technology. Any action to defend or prosecute intellectual property would be costly and result in significant diversion of the efforts of our management and technical personnel, regardless of outcome, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential, our technology and proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nWe rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not subject to patent protection. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, potential licensees, or other parties as well as through other security measures. There can be no assurance that these agreements or any security measure will provide meaningful protection for our un-patented proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. If we determine that our proprietary rights have been misappropriated, we may seek to enforce our rights which would draw upon our financial resources and divert the time and efforts of our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to convince our customers to adopt our advanced generation of hydrophilic coating technologies, our royalty revenue may decrease.\nIn our Medical Device segment, we have licensed our PhotoLink hydrophilic technology to a number of our customers for use in a variety of medical device surface applications. We have several U.S. and international issued patents and pending international patent applications protecting various aspects of these technologies, including compositions, methods of manufacture and methods of coating devices. The expiration dates for these patents and the anticipated expiration dates of the patent applications range from fiscal 2022 to 2035. These patents and patent applications represent distinct families, with each family generally covering a successive generation of the technology, including improvements that enhance coating performance, manufacturability, or other important features desired by our customers.\nApproximately 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 was generated from our fourth-generation PhotoLink technology, which is protected by a family of patents that expired in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in all countries where patent coverage existed for the technology, except in Japan, where the relevant patent will expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Of the license agreements using our early generation technologies, most will continue to generate royalty revenue at a reduced royalty rate beyond patent expiration.\nWe continue to encourage our customers to adopt our advanced technology in their products. While we are actively working to support our customers\u2019 adoption of our advanced generations of our hydrophilic coating technology, there can be no assurance that they will do so, or that those customers that have adopted, or will adopt, our hydrophilic coating technology will sell products utilizing our technology which will generate earned royalty revenue for us.\nIf we or any of our licensees breach any of the agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property from others, we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue.\nWe are a party to various agreements through which we have in-licensed or otherwise acquired rights to certain technologies that are important to our business. In exchange for the rights granted to us under these agreements, we have agreed to meet certain research, development, commercialization, sublicensing, royalty, indemnification, insurance or other obligations. If we or one of our licensees fails to comply with these obligations set forth in the relevant agreement through which we have acquired rights, we may be unable to effectively use, license, or otherwise exploit the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenue that is associated with such intellectual property.\nRISKS RELATING TO CLINICAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nThe development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant research and development and regulatory approvals, which may require clinical trials, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.\nThe development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development and regulatory approvals. Regulators may require successful clinical trials prior to granting approvals for new or enhanced products.\nThere can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for new products or enhanced products, our ability to successfully compete in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies may also adversely impact the timing of when these products contribute to our future revenue and earnings growth.\nDelays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us could result in delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization of our products.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we commenced a first-in-human clinical study of our Sundance DCB. There are risks involved in this and other clinical studies, including that they may fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients for a variety of reasons or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials for any of our products could be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with applicable regulatory authorities on a clinical study design;\n\u2022\nissuance of publications or communications relating to the safety of certain medical devices, including recent studies and communications regarding the evaluation of risks associated with paclitaxel-coated products including the FDA communication mentioned above which resulted in a temporary pause in enrollment in our TRANSCEND trial in fiscal 2019;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of a clinical study by us, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities due to adverse events or safety concerns relating to our product; and\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients willing to participate in a trial, or delays in having patients complete participation or return for post-treatment follow-up.\nIf the initiation or completion of any of the ongoing or planned clinical studies for our products is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of our products could be materially harmed. Additionally, clinical study delays may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be sure that clinical trials of our products will be successful, or that their results will be adequate to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals.\nEnrollment in the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical study for our SurVeil DCB began in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Patient 12-month follow-up visits in the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical study have successfully concluded, and we have achieved a sufficient level of follow-up visits to evaluate the primary endpoints. However, we have not yet received the results of the TRANSCEND clinical trial. We cannot be sure that the endpoints of the TRANSCEND clinical trial, or any other clinical trials that we may commence, will be met. Moreover, we cannot be sure that if successful, the TRANSCEND clinical trial, or any other clinical trials that we may commence, will support regulatory approvals of our products. We may expend significant financial and human capital resources on clinical trials. If they fail to achieve their endpoints, or support regulatory approvals, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly during the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to reduce healthcare expenditures. Certain proposals, if implemented, would impose limitations on the prices our customers will be able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for their products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, or otherwise negatively impact pricing and reimbursement. Because a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from royalties on products which constitute a percentage of our customer\u2019s product\u2019s selling price, these limitations could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nHealthcare reform continues to be a prominent political topic. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations may ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally may have on our business.\nWhole-product solutions medical devices and other products incorporating our technologies are subject to increasing scrutiny and regulations, including extensive approval/clearance processes and manufacturing requirements. Any adverse regulatory and/or enforcement action (for us or our licensees) may materially affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations both in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of industry interactions with healthcare providers. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we will continue to devote substantial human capital and financial resources to further developing and implementing policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may impact our business and results of operations. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.\nTo varying degrees, the FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. Our compliance with these laws and regulations takes significant human capital and financial resources; involves stringent testing and surveillance; involves attention to any needed product improvements (such as modifications, repairs, or replacements); and may include significant limitations of the uses of our products.\nChanges in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of products incorporating our technologies or subject us to additional regulation. Failure or delay by us or our licensees in obtaining FDA, E.U., and other necessary regulatory approval or clearance, or the loss of previously obtained approvals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur facilities and procedures are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. The FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order a recall, repair, replacement or refund of such devices; refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S governments for exports; and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.\nWe may face liability if we mishandle or improperly dispose of the hazardous materials used in some of our research, development and manufacturing processes.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities sometimes involve the controlled use of various hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. While we currently maintain insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate, we could be held liable for any damages that might result from any such event. Any such liability could exceed our insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, certain of our activities are regulated by federal and state agencies in addition to the FDA. For example, activities in connection with disposal of certain chemical waste are subject to regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We could be held liable in the event of improper disposal of such materials, even if done by third parties. Some of our reagent chemicals must be registered with the agency, with basic information filed related to toxicity during the manufacturing process as well as the toxicity of the final product. Failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, in large part attributable to developments and circumstances related to factors identified in \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Our common stock price may rise or fall sharply at any time because of this volatility, as a result of sales executed by significant holders of our stock, and also because of short positions taken by investors from time to time in our stock. For instance, the market prices for securities of medical technology, drug-delivery and biotechnology companies historically have been highly volatile, and the market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.", "PERMNO": 85889, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "SRDX"}
