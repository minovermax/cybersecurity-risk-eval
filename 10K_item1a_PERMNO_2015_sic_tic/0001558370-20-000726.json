{"cik": "1433270", "company": "ANTERO RESOURCES Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us. Furthermore, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nNatural gas, NGLs, and oil price volatility, or a substantial or prolonged period of low natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs, and oil production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Natural gas, NGLs, and oil are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u25cf worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs, and oil;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of foreign, and exports of domestic, oil, natural gas and NGLs, including liquefied natural gas;\n\u25cf political conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u25cf the level of global exploration and production;\n\u25cf the level of global inventories;\n\u25cf events that impact global market demand (e.g., the reduced demand following the recent coronavirus outbreaks);\n\u25cf prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u25cf localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u25cf weather conditions;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nThe daily spot prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $4.25 per MMBtu to a low of $1.75 per MMBtu in 2019, and the daily spot prices for NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel to a low of $46.31 per barrel during the same period. In addition, the market price for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continues to be lower relative to NYMEX Henry Hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the Northeast region in recent years. NGLs are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, which adds further volatility to the pricing of NGLs. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations.\nProlonged low, and/or significant or extended declines in, natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues, operating income, cash flows and financial position, particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices. Declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas, NGLs, and oil that we can produce economically, which may result in our having to make significant downward\nadjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur non-cash impairment charges to earnings in future periods, similar to the $1.0 billion impairment charge we recognized in the third quarter of 2019. Reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices have required us to incur additional borrowings and reduce our capital spending and could further reduce our production and our reserves, negatively affecting our future rate of growth. Lower prices for natural gas, NGLs, and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital. We are also exposed to the risk of non-performance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes, positive or negative, in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor. Further, adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection.\nIncreases in natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs, increased production taxes, increased lease operating expenses, increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased end-user conservation or conversion to alternative fuels. In addition, to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price, we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas.\nDrilling for and producing oil and gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration, development and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable hydrocarbons. Our decisions to purchase, explore, or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201c-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\u201d In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is subject to operational uncertainties.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u25cf prolonged declines in natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices;\n\u25cf limitations in the market for natural gas, NGLs, and oil;\n\u25cf delays imposed by, or resulting from, compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u25cf shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf equipment failures or accidents;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes and ice storms;\n\u25cf issues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u25cf limited availability of financing at acceptable terms; and\n\u25cf mineral interest or other title problems.\nCertain of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties.\nProperties that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that we decide to drill that do not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield natural gas or oil in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether natural gas or oil will be present or, if present, whether natural gas or oil will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot make any assurances that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf mineral interest or other title problems;\n\u25cf pressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u25cf equipment failure or accidents;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u25cf increase in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to natural gas, NGLs, and oil markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory natural gas, NGLs, and oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas, NGLs, and oil markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of natural gas, NGLs, and oil and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and other transportation services owned and operated by third parties, including Antero Midstream. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas, NGLs, and oil pipelines or gathering or processing system capacity or third-party transportation services, including with respect to services provided to us by Antero Midstream. In addition, if natural gas, NGLs, or oil quality specifications for the pipelines with which we connect change so as to restrict our ability to transport our production, our access to natural gas, NGLs, and oil markets could be impeded. If our production becomes shut in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2019, 38% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Our approximately 7.1 Tcfe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated $2.6 billion of development capital over the next five years. Moreover, the development of probable and possible reserves will require additional capital expenditures and such reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nOur exploration and development projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the exploration, development, production, and acquisition of oil and gas reserves. Our cash flow used in investing activities related to drilling, completions, and land expenditures was approximately $1.3 billion in 2019. Our board of directors has approved a capital budget for 2020 of $1.2 billion that includes $1.15 billion for drilling and completion and $50 million for leasehold expenditures. Our capital budget excludes acquisitions. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated by operations, borrowings under the Credit Facility, our asset sales program and dividends from Antero Midstream; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our capital budget as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological, and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. Furthermore, we have previously announced our intention to retire a portion of our outstanding senior notes. Although we intend to finance such retirement primarily with proceeds from asset sales, any borrowings incurred under the Credit Facility for such retirement or other refinancings of debt may limit our ability to fund our capital budget. For additional discussion of the risks regarding our ability to obtain funding, please read \u201c-The borrowing base under the Credit Facility may be reduced if commodity prices decline, which could hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. We may also be required to post additional collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, which could adversely impact available liquidity under our Credit Facility.\u201d\nThe issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u25cf our proved reserves;\n\u25cf the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf the prices at which our production is sold;\n\u25cf our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u25cf the value of our commodity derivative portfolio; and\n\u25cf our ability to borrow under the Credit Facility.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the Credit Facility decrease as a result of sustained periods of low natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under the Credit Facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our stockholders have investments in our affiliates that may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nPaul M. Rady, Glen C. Warren, Jr. and certain funds affiliated with Yorktown (collectively, the \u201cSponsors\u201d) own a significant number of shares of common stock of Antero Midstream. Messrs. Rady and Warren and an individual affiliated with Yorktown serve as members of our board of directors and the board of directors of Antero Midstream. The Sponsors also own a significant portion of the shares of our common stock. As a result of their investments in Antero Midstream, the Sponsors may have conflicting interests with other stockholders. Conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and the Sponsors, on the other hand, regarding, among other things, decisions related to our financing, capital expenditures, and growth plans, the terms of our agreements with Antero Midstream and its subsidiaries and the pursuit of potentially competitive business activities or business opportunities.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our indebtedness obligations, including the Credit Facility and our senior notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the senior notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes. For example, we recently announced an asset sale program, the proceeds of which will be used to retire a portion of our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indentures governing our senior notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes place certain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe borrowing base under the Credit Facility may be reduced if commodity prices decline, which could hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. We may also be required to post additional collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, which could adversely impact available liquidity under our Credit Facility.\nThe borrowing base under the Credit Facility is currently $4.5 billion, and lender commitments under the Credit Facility are $2.64 billion. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders each April based on certain factors, including our reserves and hedge position, with the next borrowing base redetermination scheduled to occur in April 2020. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of a decline in natural gas, NGLs, or oil prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due and could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. In addition, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, to meet our obligations. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIn addition, a downgrade to our corporate credit rating, similar to the December 2019 downgrade by Moody\u2019s Investors Services, could require us to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as pipeline transportation contracts. An increase in our outstanding letters of credit may impact our available liquidity under our Credit Facility.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, to meet our obligations.\nDeclines in commodity prices may cause the financial markets to exert downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for companies throughout the energy industry. For example, for portions of 2019, the market for senior unsecured notes was unfavorable for high-yield issuers such as us. Our plans for growth may require access to the capital and credit markets, including the ability to issue senior unsecured notes. Although the market for high-yield debt securities experienced periods of improvement in 2019, if the high-yield market deteriorates, or if we are unable to access alternative means of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nThe Credit Facility contains a number of significant covenants (in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness), including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf make loans to others;\n\u25cf make investments;\n\u25cf enter into mergers;\n\u25cf make certain payments;\n\u25cf hedge future production;\n\u25cf incur liens; and\n\u25cf engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain similar restrictive covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. These restrictions, together with those in the indentures governing our senior notes, may also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing our senior notes and the Credit Facility impose on us.\nThe Credit Facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine on an annual basis based upon projected revenues from the oil and natural gas properties and commodity derivatives securing our loan. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Credit Facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. For additional discussion of the risks regarding our ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facility, please read \u201c-The borrowing base under the Credit Facility may be reduced if commodity prices decline, which could hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. We may also be required to post additional collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, which could adversely impact available liquidity under our Credit Facility.\u201d\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Facility would result in a default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the facility and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under other debt agreements. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, during 2019, we had estimated average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of approximately $264 million, and the impact of a 1.0% increase in interest rates on this amount of indebtedness would result in increased interest expense for that period of approximately $2.6 million and a corresponding decrease in our cash flows and net income before the effects of income taxes. Furthermore, a downgrade to our credit rating would trigger certain obligations to deliver letters of credit to certain transactional counterparties, which would adversely impact our available liquidity. Disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nCurrently, we receive significant incremental cash flows as a result of our hedging activity. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at effective prices consistent with those we have received to date and natural gas prices do not improve, our cash flows may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings. In certain circumstances, we may have to make cash payments under our hedging arrangements and these payments could be significant and could result in operating costs exceeding revenues.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations, as of December 31, 2019, we had entered into forward swap contracts for approximately 1.8 Tcfe of our projected natural gas, NGLs, and oil production through December 31, 2023 and basis swap contracts for approximately 0.2 Tcfe through December 31, 2024. Historically, we have realized a significant benefit from our hedge positions. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we received approximately $613 million and $325 million, respectively, in revenues from cash settled derivatives pursuant to our hedging arrangements, including $370 million for certain natural gas hedges that were monetized prior to their contractual settlement dates during the year ended December 31, 2018. Many of the hedge agreements that resulted in these realized gains for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were executed at times when spot and future prices were higher than prices that we are currently able to obtain in the futures market, and the prices at which we have been able to hedge future production have decreased as a result. Sustained weaknesses in commodity prices adversely affect our ability to hedge future production. If we are unable to enter into new hedge contracts in the future at favorable pricing and for sufficient volumes, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, since we have financial derivatives in place in order to hedge against price declines for a significant part of our estimated future production, we have fixed or limited a significant part of our overall future revenues. Approximately 70% of our estimated production for 2020 is hedged through either forward swaps or basis swaps. If natural gas, NGLs, or oil prices upon settlement of our derivative contracts exceed the price at which we have hedged our commodities, we will be obligated to make cash payments to our hedge counterparties, which could, in certain circumstances, be significant. If development drilling costs increase significantly because of inflation, increased demand for oilfield services, increased costs to comply with regulations governing our industry or other factors, the payments we receive under these derivative contracts may not be sufficient to cover our costs.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk and may become more costly or unavailable to us.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our commodity net derivative contracts was approximately $746 million, primarily including the following net asset values by bank counterparty: Wells Fargo - $215 million; JP Morgan - $134 million; Morgan Stanley - $121 million; Citigroup - $117 million; Scotiabank - $58 million; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce - $44 million; PNC - $29 million; BNP Paribas - $21 million; Natixis - $10 million; and SunTrust $7 million.\nAs described above, we enter into certain derivative instruments in the ordinary course operations of our business. Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract. Derivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received or there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash\notherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness, and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, and interest rates.\nIn addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas, NGLs, and oil, which could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. If natural gas, NGLs, or oil prices upon settlement of our derivative contracts exceed the price at which we have hedged our commodities, we will be obligated to make cash payments to our hedge counterparties, which could, in certain circumstances, be significant.\nIn addition, U.S. regulators adopted a final rule in November 2019 implementing a new approach for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts under the applicable agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rules, referred to as the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d). As adopted, certain financial institutions are required to comply with the new SA-CCR rules beginning on January 1, 2022. The new rules could significantly increase the capital requirements for certain participants in the over-the-counter derivatives market in which we participate. These increased capital requirements could result in significant additional costs being passed through to end-users like us or reduce the number of participants or products available to us in the over-the-counter derivatives market. The effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities, or substantially increase the cost of hedging, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to pay fees to our service providers based on minimum volumes under long-term contracts regardless of actual volume throughput.\nWe have various firm transportation and gas processing, gathering and compression service agreements in place, each with minimum volume delivery commitments. Lower commodity prices may lead to reductions in our drilling program, which may result in insufficient production to fully utilize our firm transportation and processing capacity. Our firm transportation agreements expire at various dates from 2021 to 2058, our gas processing, gathering, and compression services agreements expire at various dates from 2020 to 2038. We are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers regardless of actual volume throughput. As of December 31, 2019, our long-term contractual obligations under agreements with minimum volume commitments totaled over $18 billion over the term of the contracts. If we have insufficient production to meet the minimum volumes, our cash flow from operations will be reduced, which may require us to reduce or delay our planned investments and capital expenditures or seek alternative means of financing, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBased on current projected 2020 annual production guidance, we estimate that we could incur annual net marketing costs of $0.10 per Mcfe to $0.12 per Mcfe in 2020 for unutilized transportation capacity depending on the amount of unutilized capacity that can be marketed to third parties or utilized to transport third party gas and capture positive basis differentials. Additionally, our net marketing expense could increase depending on utilization of our transportation capacity based on future production and how much, if any, future excess transportation can be marketed to third parties.\nWe may be limited in our ability to choose gathering operators, processing and fractionation services providers and water services providers in our areas of operations pursuant to our agreements with Antero Midstream.\nPursuant to the gas gathering and compression agreement that we have entered into with Antero Midstream, we have dedicated the gathering and compression of all of our current and future natural gas production in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania to Antero Midstream, so long as such production is not otherwise subject to a pre-existing dedication. Further, pursuant to the right of first offer agreement that we have entered into with Antero Midstream, Antero Midstream has a right to bid to provide certain processing and fractionation services in respect of all of our current and future gas production (as long as it is not subject to a pre-existing dedication) and will be entitled to provide such services if its bid matches or is more favorable to us than terms proposed by other parties. As a result, we will be limited in our ability to use other gathering and compression operators in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, even if such operators are able to offer us more efficient service. We will also be limited in our ability to use other processing and fractionation services providers in any area to the extent Antero Midstream is able to offer a competitive bid.\nPursuant to the Water Services Agreement that we have entered into with Antero Midstream, we have dedicated the provision of fresh water and wastewater services in defined service areas in Ohio and West Virginia to Antero Midstream. Additionally, the Water Services Agreement provides Antero Midstream with a right of first offer on any future areas of operation outside of those defined areas. As a result, we will be limited in our ability to use other water services providers in the dedication areas of Ohio and West Virginia or other future areas of operation, even if such providers are able to offer us more favorable pricing or more efficient service.\nIf additional takeaway pipelines under construction or other pipeline projects are not completed, our future growth may be limited.\nWe have secured sufficient long-term firm takeaway capacity on major pipelines that are in existence or currently under construction in each of our core operating areas to accommodate our current development plan. Any unavailability of existing takeaway pipelines could cause us to curtail our future development and production plans, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to produce natural gas, NGLs, and oil economically and in commercial quantities is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling facilities and services at a reasonable cost. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to produce commercial quantities of natural gas, NGLs, and oil requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. The availability of water recycling facilities and other disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells may affect our production. For example, Antero Midstream idled its wastewater treatment facility and related landfill in September 2019, which limits Antero Midstream\u2019s available outlets to dispose of our produced water. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights, could adversely impact our operations. Additionally, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure through a cased and cemented wellbore into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations, as does most of the domestic oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 regarding such activities. In addition, the EPA finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.\nCertain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. Because the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.\nIn addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, the Ohio legislature has adopted a law requiring oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients used to hydraulically fracture wells and to conduct pre-drill baseline water quality sampling of certain water wells near a proposed horizontal well. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Some states and municipalities have banned and others seek to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.\nThe process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as realized prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, realized prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust our reserve estimates to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, existing commodity prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nInvestors should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nOur identified potential well locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our potential well locations.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, unitization agreements, lease acquisitions, surface agreements, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. For more information on our future potential acreage expirations, see \u201cItem 1. Business and Properties-Our Properties and Operations-Undeveloped Acreage Expirations.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 2,385 identified potential horizontal well locations located in our proved, probable, and possible reserve base. As a result of the limitations described above, we may be unable to drill many of our potential well locations. In addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to obtain or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful or result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations. For more information on our identified potential well locations, see \u201cItem 1. Business and Properties-Our Properties and Operations-Estimated Proved Reserves-Identification of Potential Well Locations.\u201d\nApproximately 65% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nApproximately 65% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. We have proved undeveloped reserves of 687 Bcfe related to such acreage that is subject to renewal prior to drilling. In addition, approximately 30% and 29% of our natural gas leases related to our Marcellus and Utica acreage, respectively, require us to drill wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. Our future oil and gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly\ndependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. For more information on our future potential acreage expirations, see \u201cItem 1. Business and Properties-Our Properties and Operations-Undeveloped Acreage Expirations.\u201d\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves.\nInvestors should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas, NGLs, and oil, the amount, timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure is based on SEC guidelines, and may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian Basin in West Virginia and Ohio. At December 31, 2019, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by, and costs associated with, governmental regulation, state and local political activities, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, NGLs, or oil.\nIn addition, a number of areas within the Appalachian Basin have historically been subject to mining operations. For example, third-parties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties, which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties, adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact third-party midstream activities on which we rely. In such event, our operations may be impaired or interrupted, and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shut-ins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells. Furthermore, the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity. These restrictions on our operations, and any similar restrictions, could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nInterruptions in operations at facilities that process our gas may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have agreements with processing facilities, including those owned by MPLX and the Joint Venture to accommodate our current operations as well as future development plans. Any significant interruptions at these facilities could cause us to curtail our future development and production plans, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of the processing facilities could be partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of circumstances not within the operator\u2019s control, such as:\n\u25cf unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events, including damages to facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf restrictions imposed by governmental authorities or court proceedings;\n\u25cf labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of power, water and other resources necessary to operate the facilities;\n\u25cf damage to the facilities resulting from NGLs that do not comply with applicable specifications;\n\u25cf inadequate fractionation capacity or market access to support production volumes, including lack of availability of rail cars, barges, trucks and pipeline capacity, or market constraints, including reduced demand or limited markets for certain NGL products; and\n\u25cf terrorist or cyber-attacks.\nOur failure to develop, obtain, access or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas, NGLs, and oil to market may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur delivery of natural gas, NGLs, and oil depends upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering and processing and fractionation facilities and the availability of other third-party transportation services. The capacity of transmission, gathering and processing and fractionation facilities and availability of third-party transportation services may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs, and oil. While our investment in midstream infrastructure through Antero Midstream is intended to address access to and potential curtailments on existing midstream infrastructure, we also deliver to and are serviced by third-party natural gas, NGLs, and oil transmission, gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities and transportation services that are limited in number, geographically concentrated and subject to significant risks. These risks include the availability of capital, materials and qualified contractors and work force, as well as weather conditions, natural gas, NGLs, and oil price volatility, delays in obtaining permits and other government approvals, title and property access problems, geology, public opposition to infrastructure development, compliance by Antero Midstream and/or third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors. An extended interruption of access to or service from pipelines and facilities operated by Antero Midstream and/or third parties, or of transportation services provided by Antero Midstream and/or third parties for any reason, including cyber-attacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality, could result in adverse consequences to us, such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas, NGLs, and oil. In such an event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at prices lower than market prices or at prices lower than we currently project, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. Leases in the Appalachian Basin are particularly vulnerable to title deficiencies due to the long history of land ownership in the area, resulting in extensive and complex chains of title. Additionally, there are claims against us alleging that certain acquired leases that are held by production are invalid due to production from the producing horizons being insufficient to hold title to the formation rights that we have purchased. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we do typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of our properties. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For example, see the discussion of the impairment charges we recorded in 2018 and 2019 with respect to our Utica Shale properties in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We may incur significant impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our reserves and, eventually, production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production, and any such acquisition and development may be offset by any asset disposition, including those contemplated by our asset sale program. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and gas products.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and gas products, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our natural gas, NGLs, and oil production that we market to energy companies, end users, and refineries ($297 million at December 31, 2019). We are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our products during the year ended December 31, 2019 accounted for approximately 16% of our product revenues. We do not require all of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development and production activities. These delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety, including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations.\nStrict, joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations. We have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters. For example, we have been named as the defendant in separate lawsuits in West Virginia in which the plaintiffs have alleged that our oil and natural gas activities exposed them to hazardous substances and damaged their properties. Also, new laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the possibility of:\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater, air and shoreline contamination;\n\u25cf abnormally pressured formations;\n\u25cf mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u25cf fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u25cf personal injuries and death;\n\u25cf natural disasters; and\n\u25cf terrorist attacks targeting natural gas and oil related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u25cf injury or loss of life;\n\u25cf damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u25cf pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u25cf regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u25cf suspension of our operations; and\n\u25cf repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, and the production, processing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs, and oil. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, including any evolving interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to existing or new regulations may unfavorably impact us. Such potential regulations could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, completion services, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline\u2019s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress, and such increased regulation could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EPAct of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,291,894 per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our systems have not been regulated by FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to a series of risks related to climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for our products.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA for those emissions. These EPA rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. For example, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities, as well as completions and workovers of hydraulically fractured wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. These changes to EPA\u2019s GHG emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs.\nIn June 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations, known as Subpart OOOOa, that establish emission standards for methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. The EPA\u2019s rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. In addition, the rule package extends existing VOC standards under the EPA\u2019s Subpart OOOO to include previously unregulated equipment within the oil and natural gas\nsource category. There have been several attempts to delay or modify these regulations. Most recently, in August 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 standards that, among other things, would remove sources in the transmission and storage segment from the oil and gas source category and rescind the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the industry. As an alternative, the EPA also proposed to rescind the methane-specific requirements that apply to all sources in the oil and gas industry, without removing the transmission and storage sources from the current source category. Under either alternative, the EPA plans to retain emissions limits for VOCs. Legal challenges to any final rulemaking that rescinds the 2016 standards are expected. As a result of the foregoing, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPA\u2019s 2016 methane rule. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility, and several states, including West Virginia and Ohio, have separately imposed or are considering imposing their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years. Nevertheless, increasing scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change has increased the possibility of political action related to climate change. For example, various pledges have been made by candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 2020. These have included promises to pursue actions that would be adverse to oil and gas production and processing activities, though the extent of any such actions cannot be predicted at this time.\nIn the absence of federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions or transitions to alternative forms of energy could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Depending on the severity of any such limitations, the effect on the value of our reserves could be significant.\nOn an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force on November 4, 2016; however, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants. Moreover, in November 2019, the United States formally initiated the yearlong process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, the United States may subsequently choose to reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement, though the terms of any such agreement are uncertain at this time.\nSeparately, increased attention to climate change risks has increased the possibility of claims brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. While we are not currently party to any such private litigation, we could be named in future actions making similar claims of liability. Moreover, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company\u2019s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nNotwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Increased scrutiny because of climate change related concern could result in a loss of certain investors. In addition, institutional lenders may, of their own accord, elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies based on climate change related concerns, which could affect our access to capital for potential growth projects.\nFinally, it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nRegulations related to the protection of wildlife adversely could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife. For example, on January 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the USFWS to reconsider its decision to list the northern long-eared bat as threatened instead of endangered. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered, or redesignation of a threatened species as endangered, in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market products and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing products and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTerrorist or cyber-attacks and threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist or cyber-attacks may significantly affect the energy industry, including our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, as well as general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending, and market liquidity. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. We depend on digital technology in many areas of our business and operations, including, but not limited to, estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, processing and recording financial and operating data, oversight and analysis of drilling operations, and communications with our employees and third-party customers or service providers. Deliberate attacks on our assets, or security breaches in our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third-parties or the cloud, could lead to the corruption or loss of our proprietary and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery of our production to customers, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, or other operational disruptions and third-party liabilities. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data.\nAs cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our personnel, information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Paul M. Rady, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Glen C. Warren, Jr., our President and Chief Financial Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur officers and employees provide services to both us and Antero Midstream.\nAll of our executive officers and other personnel provide corporate, general and administrative services to Antero Midstream and, when providing services to Antero Midstream, are concurrently employed by us and Antero Midstream pursuant to the terms of a services agreement. In addition, certain of our operational personnel are seconded to Antero Midstream pursuant to the terms of a secondment agreement and are concurrently employed by us and Antero Midstream during such secondment. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to us and Antero Midstream. If such officers and employees do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business, our financial results may suffer.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions of properties.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u25cf recoverable reserves;\n\u25cf future natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u25cf operating costs; and\n\u25cf potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future, we may acquire businesses that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. The Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities and repayment of indebtedness, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our various initiatives may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. In developing our 2020 business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses, including well development, reserve acquisitions, exploratory activities, midstream infrastructure, corporate items, repayment of indebtedness and other alternatives. We also considered our likely sources of capital, including potential asset sales. Notwithstanding the\ndeterminations made in the development of our 2020 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies, including the appropriate corporate structure, appropriate rate of reserve development, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2020 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nWe periodically engage in acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures. These transactions involve various inherent risks, such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals; the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals; the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities; and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions. In addition, various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions. Competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing us to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may have little control over, and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture. Our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose a significant portion of your investment.\nThe market price of the common stock could be volatile, and holders of common stock may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they acquired such securities due to fluctuations in the market price of common stock.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock include:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects and the trading price of our common stock;\n\u25cf the level of any dividends we may declare;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as dividends per share of our common stock, net income and revenues;\n\u25cf levels of indebtedness;\n\u25cf changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u25cf speculation by the press or investment community;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by other stockholders;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, securities offerings or capital commitments;\n\u25cf general market conditions;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf adverse changes in tax laws or regulations; and\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors related to our performance.\nThere may be future dilution of our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock out of our authorized capital. In the future, we may issue shares of our common stock to raise cash for future activities, acquisitions or other purposes. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and shares of our common stock or only shares. We may also issue securities\nconvertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial amount of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nSales of a substantial amount of shares of our common stock in the public market or grants to our directors and officers under the AR LTIP, or the perception that these sales or grants may occur, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock. All of the shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless the shares are held by any of our \u201caffiliates\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u25cf provide advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder nominations of candidates for election as directors or other stockholder proposals to be brought before meetings of our stockholders, which may preclude our stockholders from bringing certain matters before our stockholders at an annual or special meeting;\n\u25cf provide our board of directors the ability to authorize issuance of preferred stock in one or more series, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us and which may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us;\n\u25cf provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf provide that, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors or fill vacancies in respect of such directors as specified in the related preferred stock designation, all vacancies, including newly created directorships be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and will not be filled by our stockholders;\n\u25cf provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, if any, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders;\n\u25cf provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock, if any, to remove directors elected by such series of preferred stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation (including any preferred stock designation thereunder), directors may be removed from office at any time, only for cause and by the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding voting shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;\n\u25cf provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called only by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of our board of directors or our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that we would have if there were no vacancies;\n\u25cf provide that (i) the Sponsors and their affiliates are permitted to participate (directly or indirectly) in venture capital and other direct investments in corporations, joint ventures, limited liability companies and other entities conducting business of any kind, nature or description, (ii) the Sponsors and their affiliates are permitted to have interests in, participate with, aid and maintain seats on the boards of directors or similar governing bodies of any such investments, in each case that\nmay, are or will be competitive with our business and the business of our subsidiaries or in the same or similar lines of business as us and our subsidiaries, or that could be suitable for us or our subsidiaries and (iii) we have, subject to limited exceptions, renounced, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, such corporate opportunities;\n\u25cf provide that the provisions of our certificate of incorporation can only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and\n\u25cf provide that our bylaws can be altered or repealed by (a) our board of directors or (b) our stockholders upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with it or its directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have elected not to be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, regulating corporate takeovers.\nIn general, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL prohibit a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for trading on the NYSE, from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u25cf prior to such time, the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by our board of directors;\n\u25cf upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding certain specified shares); or\n\u25cf on or after such time the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nSection 203 of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to elect not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, we expressly elected not to be governed by Section 203. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects or protections of Section 203 of the DGCL, although no assurance can be given that we will not elect to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL pursuant to an amendment to our certificate of incorporation in the future.\nWe may issue preferred stock, which may have terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of our preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of a class or series of our preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of our preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFinal regulations relating to and interpretations of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation.\nThe U.S. federal income tax legislation enacted in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have issued, and are expected to continue to issue, final regulations and additional interpretive guidance with respect to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such provisions from any future final regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business.\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards are limited, we do not generate expected deductions, or tax authorities challenge certain of our tax positions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards of $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, some of which expire at various dates from 2032 to 2038 while others have no expiration date. We expect to be able to utilize these NOL carryforwards and generate deductions to offset our future taxable income. This expectation is based upon assumptions we have made regarding, among other things, our income, capital expenditures and net working capital, and the current expectation that our NOL carryforwards will not become subject to future limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or otherwise. Additionally, any significant variance in our interpretation of current income tax laws, including as result of the release of final Treasury Regulations or other interpretive guidance implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or a challenge of one or more of our tax positions by the IRS or other tax authorities could affect our tax position. While we expect to be able to utilize our NOL carryforwards and generate deductions to offset our future taxable income, in the event that deductions are not generated as expected, one or more of our tax positions are successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise), or our NOL carryforwards are subject to future limitations, our future tax liability may be greater than expected.\nChanges to state tax laws in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or that impose new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction may result in an increase in the state taxes we pay.\nCurrently, many states conform their calculation of corporate taxable income to the calculation of corporate taxable income at the U.S. federal level. Due to changes to U.S. federal income tax laws as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, certain states may change or modify the calculation of corporate taxable income at the state level. Any resulting increase in costs due to such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, states in which we operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction, which could negatively affect our future cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14179, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "AR"}
