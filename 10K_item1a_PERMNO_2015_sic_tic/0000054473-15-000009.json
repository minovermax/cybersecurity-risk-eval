{"cik": "54473", "company": "KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe operating results of life insurance companies have historically been subject to significant fluctuations. The factors which could affect the Company\u2019s future results include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and the known trends and uncertainties which are discussed more fully below.\nStrategic, Product, and Operational Risks:\nThe Company operates in a mature, highly competitive industry, which could limit its ability to grow sales or maintain its position in the industry and negatively affect profitability.\nLife insurance is a mature and highly competitive industry. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from other insurance companies, many of which may have greater financial resources, a greater market share, a broader range of products, lower product prices, better name recognition, greater actual or perceived financial strength, higher claims-paying ratings, the ability to assume a greater level of risk, lower operating or financing costs, or lower profitability expectations.\nIn recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry, resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Furthermore, many of these larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. The Company expects consolidation to continue, likely resulting in increasing competitive pressures.\nChanges in demographics, particularly the aging of the population and the decline in the number of agents in the industry, may affect the sales of life insurance products. Also, as technology evolves, customers and agents may be able to compare products of any particular company with any other, which could lead to increased competition as well as changes in agent or customer behavior, including persistency, that differs from past behavior.\nThe Company may be unable to attract agencies and agents.\nThe Company sells insurance and annuity products through independent agents and agencies. These agencies and agents are not captive and may sell products of the Company\u2019s competitors. The Company\u2019s ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract agents and agencies to market its insurance products, its ability to develop competitive and profitable products, its ability to control unit cost growth, and its maintenance of strong financial strength ratings. Sales and the results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company is unsuccessful in attracting agencies and agents.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to retain agents is dependent upon a number of factors, including: the ability of the Company to maintain a competitive compensation system while also offering products with competitive features and benefits for policyholders; the ability to maintain a level of service and support activities that effectively support the agent and agents needs; and the ability to approve and monitor agent and agents sales and business practices that are consistent with regulatory requirements and expectations of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain competitive unit costs is dependent upon the level of new sales.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain competitive unit costs is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the level of new sales, persistency (continuation or renewal) of existing business, and expense management. A decrease in sales or the amount of total existing business or deterioration in the profitability of the existing business without a corresponding reduction in expenses may result in higher unit costs, which would affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s policy claims fluctuate from period to period, resulting in earnings volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in policy claims incurred by the Company. However, the Company reinsures a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten and newly issued individual life insurance contracts. The Company regularly reviews retention limits for continued appropriateness and these limits may be changed in the future. If the Company was to experience significant adverse mortality or morbidity experience, it is expected that a significant portion of that expense would be reimbursed by reinsurers.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected should actual experience differ from management\u2019s assumptions and estimates.\nThe Company makes certain assumptions regarding mortality, persistency, expenses, interest rates, tax liability, business mix, policyholder behavior, and other factors appropriate for the type of business results it expects to experience in future periods. These assumptions are also used to estimate the amounts of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), policy reserves and accruals, future earnings, and various components of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assumptions are used in the operations of the Company\u2019s business in making decisions that are crucial to its success, including the pricing of products and expense structures relating to products. The Company\u2019s actual experience and changes in estimates are reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company\u2019s actual experience may vary from period to period and from established assumptions, potentially resulting in variability in the financial statements.\nAssumptions and estimates involve judgment and are subject to changes and revision over time.\nThe calculations the Company uses to estimate various components of its financial statements are complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data. The Company employs various techniques for such calculations and, from time to time, will develop and implement more sophisticated systems and procedures to facilitate calculations and improve estimates. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s results may be affected, positively or negatively, by actual results differing from assumptions, by changes in estimates, and by changes resulting from implementing new administrative systems and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s reserves for future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate.\nThe Company establishes and carries a reserve liability based on estimates of how much will be needed to pay for future benefits and claims. The assumptions and estimates used in connection with establishing and carrying reserves are inherently uncertain and in some cases are mandated by regulators, irrespective of a company's actual experience. If actual experience is significantly different from assumptions or estimates or if regulators decide to increase or change regulations, reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to estimated future benefits and claims. As a result, a charge to earnings would be incurred in the quarter in which the Company increases reserves.\nThe amortization of DAC, VOBA, and deferred revenue liability (DRL) may change, impacting both the level of the asset and the timing of the Company\u2019s net income.\nAmortization of DAC, VOBA, and DRL depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the lines of business that incurred the costs. Expected profits are dependent on assumptions regarding a number of factors, including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality, and policy persistency. Due to the nature of the business, the Company cannot anticipate the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of DAC, VOBA, and DRL will vary from period to period as actual profits replace expected profits and future expected profits are re-projected based on management\u2019s best estimates as of the reporting dates. To the extent that actual experience emerges less favorably than expected or expectations for future profits decrease, the DAC and VOBA assets and the DRL may be reduced. This would likely result in increased amortization and reduced profitability in the period assumptions are modified to reflect changes in management expectations.\nThe Company is dependent on the performance of others and continued consumer confidence.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be affected by the performance of others because the Company has entered into various arrangements involving other parties. For example, most of the Company\u2019s products are sold through independent distribution channels, and variable universal life and annuity deposits are invested in funds managed by third parties. Additionally, the Company\u2019s operations are dependent on various technologies, some of which are provided by other parties.\nAs with all financial services companies, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business is dependent upon consumer confidence in the industry and its products. Actions of competitors and financial difficulties of other companies in the industry could undermine consumer confidence and adversely affect retention of existing business and future sales of the Company\u2019s insurance and investment products.\nRisk management policies and procedures may leave the Company exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect business or result in losses.\nThe Company has devoted significant resources to develop risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so in the future. However, the Company\u2019s policies and procedures used to identify, monitor, and manage risks may not be fully effective. Many of the methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical policyholder and market behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not effectively identify or evaluate the magnitude of existing or future exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. An example of such risks includes the risk of pandemics, which could cause a large number of deaths. Other risk management methods depend\nupon the evaluation of information regarding markets, agents, clients, catastrophe occurrence, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date, or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal, and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may adversely affect the business, financial condition, and/or operating results.\nA rating downgrade could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete and increase the number or value of policies surrendered.\nThe Company\u2019s financial strength rating, which is intended to measure its ability to meet policyholder obligations, is an important factor affecting public confidence in most of the Company\u2019s products and, as a result, the Company\u2019s competitiveness. Rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including the Company, and downgrades of insurance companies occur frequently.\nA downgrade in the Company\u2019s rating could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell its products, retain existing business, and compete for attractive acquisition opportunities. Rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company\u2019s control. In addition, rating organizations use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion, altered the models. Changes to the models could impact the judgment of the rating organizations of the rating to be assigned to a company. The Company cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take or what actions the Company may be required to take in response to the actions of the rating organizations.\nThe Company may be unable to complete additional acquisitions or realize its anticipated financial results from its acquisitions.\nOne of the Company\u2019s growth strategies is to acquire other life insurance companies and/or blocks of business. The Company\u2019s previous acquisitions have increased earnings by allowing the Company to realize certain operating efficiencies or increase sales. However, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will continue to be available to the Company. Further, sufficient capital to fund acquisitions may not be available at the time opportunities arise.\nThe completion of an acquisition may be more costly or take longer than expected. There may be unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with businesses that the Company acquires. Additionally, the Company assumes or otherwise becomes responsible for the obligations of policies and liabilities of other insurers it acquires. Any regulatory, legal, financial, or other adverse development affecting the other insurer could also have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to establish, maintain, assess, and update its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or misstatements. While the Company assesses its controls on an ongoing basis, these controls can only provide reasonable assurance that the required financial objectives are met and adhered to. There are inherent limitations of internal controls that include, but are not limited to, resource constraints, undetected errors, fraud, and collusion. The Company believes that its internal controls provide reasonable assurance that its financial statements are materially correct. However, undetected ineffective internal controls could result in errors or misstatements in the Company's financial statements.\nInvestment and Asset/Liability Management Risks:\nThe Company\u2019s investments are subject to market and credit risks.\nThe Company\u2019s invested assets, primarily including fixed maturity securities, are subject to customary risks of credit defaults and changes in fair value. The value of the Company\u2019s commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios also depend on the financial condition of the borrowers and tenants occupying the properties which the Company has financed. Factors that may affect the overall default rate on and fair value of the Company\u2019s invested assets include interest rate levels and changes, availability and cost of liquidity, financial market performance, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses of individual borrowers and tenants.\nInterest rate fluctuations could negatively affect the Company\u2019s spread income or otherwise impact its business.\nInterest rate fluctuations or sustained low interest rate environments could negatively affect earnings because the profitability of certain products depends in part on interest rate spreads. These products include fixed deferred annuities, single premium immediate annuities, interest-sensitive whole life, universal life, and the fixed portion of variable universal life insurance and variable annuity business. In addition, the Company offers riders, including guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits. Changes in interest rates or sustained low interest rate environments may reduce both the profitability and the return on invested capital.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products, principally fixed annuities, interest-sensitive whole life, universal life, and the fixed portion of variable universal life insurance and variable annuity business have interest rate guarantees that expose the Company to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread, or the difference between the amounts the Company is required to credit to policyholder contracts and the amounts earned by the Company on general account investments. Declines in spread or instances where the returns on the general account investments are not sufficient to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. In periods of increasing interest rates, the Company may not be able to replace the assets in the general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates that may be necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. The Company, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and profitability or face a decline in sales, loss of existing contracts from non-renewed maturities, early withdrawals, or surrenders. In periods of declining interest rates, the Company has to reinvest the cash received from interest or return of principal on investments in lower yielding instruments then available. Moreover, issuers of fixed-income investment securities and borrowers related to the Company\u2019s commercial mortgage investments may prepay these obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which may exacerbate the risk for the Company of having to reinvest at lower rates.\nThe Company is entitled to reset the interest rates it credits on fixed-rate annuities. Because many of the Company\u2019s policies have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase, as policyholders seek to buy products with higher returns. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Further, higher interest rates may result in significant unrealized losses on investments. These net unrealized losses could negatively impact stockholders' equity. This could result in negative impacts, such as the ability to pay policyholder and stockholder dividends. In addition, higher interest rates may reduce the fair value of policyholders' separate account investments, which may reduce the Company's revenues from asset-based management fees.\nWhile the Company develops and maintains asset/liability management programs and procedures designed to mitigate the effect on spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments, no assurance can be given that changes in interest rates will not affect such spreads. Additionally, the Company\u2019s asset/liability management programs incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve) and relationships between risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity, and policyholder behavior in periods of changing interest rates and other factors. The effectiveness of the Company\u2019s asset/liability management programs and procedures may be negatively affected whenever actual results differ from these assumptions.\nProlonged periods of low interest rates can affect policyholder behavior and negatively impact earnings.\nAs interest rates decline, policyholders may become more likely to extend the retention or duration of fixed-rate products previously purchased and may seek alternatives to fixed-rate products for new purchases. Policyholders may add premiums or deposits to existing policies or contracts with terms upon which the Company is no longer offering on new products. Many of the products sold in earlier periods may have minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates or other features that are greater than those being offered in the current low interest rate environment. Additionally, cash flows from existing investments, including interest and principal payments, may be reinvested at lower interest rates relative to prior periods. As a result, a prolonged low interest rate environment can result in significant changes to cash flows, lower investment income, compressed product spreads, reduced earnings, and increased surplus strain. In addition, the Company may change its risk profiles in regards to selecting investment opportunities to reduce the impact on earnings.\nThe change from a low interest rate environment to an environment of increasing interest rates can affect policyholder behavior and negatively impact earnings.\nThe change from a period of low interest rates to a period of significantly higher and increasing interest rates may cause policyholders to surrender policies or to make early withdrawals in order to maximize their returns. Accordingly, the Company may become more susceptible to increased surrenders and withdrawals on policies, as surrender charges and other features that help protect the Company from increased or unexpected policyholder withdrawals or lapses. Increases in policyholder surrenders, withdrawals, or lapses could negatively affect the Company's operating results and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations, and assumptions and could result in changes to investment valuations that may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed maturity securities, equity securities, and short-term investments are reported at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and represent the majority of total cash and invested assets. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The level in the fair value hierarchy is based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability\u2019s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its valuation.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were previously acquired and valued in active markets with significant observable data that are now valued in illiquid markets with little observable data. In such cases, more securities may be classified in Level 3 and, therefore, require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more complex or require increased estimation, thereby resulting in values which may have greater variance from the value at which the investments may or could be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in the consolidated financial statements, and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nEquity market volatility could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company is exposed to equity market volatility in the following ways:\n\u2022\nThe Company has exposure to equity price risk through investments, but this exposure is limited due to the relatively small equity portfolio held during the periods presented.\n\u2022\nThe Company earns investment management fees and mortality and expense fee income based upon the value of assets held in the Company\u2019s separate accounts from both its direct and reinsurance arrangements. Revenues from these sources fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the separate accounts.\n\u2022\nVolatility in equity markets may discourage purchasers of variable universal life and annuity products that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may also result in existing customers withdrawing cash values or reducing investments in those products.\n\u2022\nThe Company has equity price risk to the extent that it may affect the liability recognized under guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit provisions of the variable contracts. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with such products, which ultimately results in a reduction to net income.\n\u2022\nThe amortization of DAC relating to variable products can fluctuate with changes in the performance of the underlying separate accounts due to the impact on estimated gross profits.\nThe determination of the amount of realized and unrealized impairments and allowances established on the Company\u2019s investments is highly subjective and could materially impact results of operations or financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments and allowances varies by investment type and is based upon the Company\u2019s evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. There can be no assurance that the assumptions, methodologies, and judgments employed in these evaluations and assessments will be accurate or sufficient in later periods. As a result, additional impairments may need to be realized or allowances provided in future periods. Further, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.\nAdditionally, the Company considers a wide range of factors about security issuers and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management\u2019s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer, its future earnings potential, and the ability and timeliness of the security\u2019s recovery in fair value.\nThe Company could be forced to sell investments at a loss to meet policyholder withdrawals.\nMany of the products offered by the Company allow policy and contract holders to withdraw their funds under defined circumstances. The Company manages liabilities and attempts to align the investment portfolio so as to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands, contract benefits, and maturities. While the Company owns a significant amount of liquid assets, a certain portion of investment assets are relatively illiquid. If the Company experiences unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity, the Company could exhaust all other sources of liquidity and be forced to liquidate assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms. If the Company is forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company invests in certain low income housing real estate properties specifically to generate state and federal tax credits. Economic forces may negatively impact the ongoing performance of these investments and regulatory bodies may reduce the availability of tax credits.\nIn recent periods, both the state and federal governments have offered selected tax credits for low income housing real estate properties. These tax credits have become the targets of certain regulators to either reduce or to eliminate the available credits that companies can receive. The willingness of regulators to reduce or eliminate these available credits could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s tax strategy. In addition, the economic environment may negatively impact the operating performance of these properties and result in either losses for these properties or tax credit recapture to the holders of these credits. Accordingly, these items may negatively impact or impair the value of the properties or the current or future ability to realize or maintain tax credits previously recognized or tax credits to be realized in the future.\nThe Company's mortgage loan investments are subject to default and volatility in performance.\nAs an asset class, mortgage loans have experienced heightened delinquency and default risk in certain historical periods due to difficult economic conditions. These conditions may result in a negative impact on the performance of the underlying collateral, resulting in declining values and volatility in the ability of the holders to repay these instruments. An increase in defaults on the Company's mortgage loan investments could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may be exposed to environmental liability from its commercial loan and real estate investments.\nThe Company customarily conducts environmental assessments prior to making commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and before taking title to real estate. Based on the Company\u2019s environmental assessments made through the date of the financial statements, the Company believes that any compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of affected properties would not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. However, no assurance can be provided that material compliance costs will not be incurred by the Company in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage loan investments in the Pacific region of the United States may subject it to losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes in this area.\nThe Company has a sizeable concentration of commercial mortgage loans in the Pacific region of the United States. This concentration exposes the Company to potential losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes and fires, which may occur in the region. The Company diversifies its commercial mortgage loan portfolio in this region by both location and type of property in an effort to reduce catastrophic exposure. However, such diversification does not eliminate the risk of such losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage loan investments in regions with significant concentration may subject it to losses resulting from the impact of an economic downturn in that region.\nThe Company has a sizeable concentration of commercial mortgage loans in certain regions of the United States. Severe adverse economic conditions in these regions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Risks:\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs, as well as access to capital and cost of capital.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience extreme volatility and disruption. The volatility and disruption can exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit for certain sectors and issuers. Although the Company has not issued new equity or debt securities in recent years, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by future disruptions in the capital and credit markets.\nThe Company\u2019s level of cash and investments, along with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term policyholder and operational obligations. However, withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, such as changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder behavior, changes in agent practices, or changes in the Company\u2019s claims-paying ability or financial strength ratings. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. In the event that the Company\u2019s current internal sources of liquidity do not satisfy these needs, additional financing may be required and, in such case, the Company may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, the Company\u2019s credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of long- or short-term financial prospects if the Company incurs large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity is decreased due to a market downturn. Similarly, access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against the Company.\nDisruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit the Company\u2019s access to external sources of liquidity, which could be required to operate its business. Such market conditions could limit the Company\u2019s ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner; satisfy capital requirements; fund redemption requests on insurance or other financial products; generate fee income and market-related revenue; meet liquidity needs; and access the capital necessary to grow the business. As such, the Company could be forced to delay raising capital, utilize available internal resources, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease the Company\u2019s profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to grow depends in large part upon the continued availability of capital.\nThe Company deploys significant amounts of capital to support its sales and acquisition efforts. Although the Company believes it has sufficient capital to fund its immediate growth and capital needs, the amount of capital available could vary in the future due to a variety of circumstances, some of which are neither predictable nor foreseeable, nor within the Company\u2019s control. A lack of sufficient capital could impair the Company\u2019s ability to grow.\nRegulatory Risks:\nInsurance companies are highly regulated and are subject to numerous legal restrictions and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which business is conducted. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and, in some instances, discretionary power dealing with many aspects of the Company\u2019s business. This may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers, and capital adequacy. Government regulation of insurers is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other customers rather than shareholders. Interpretations of regulations by regulators may change, and statutes, regulations, and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or reserve requirements.\nThe Company cannot predict whether or in what manner regulatory reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect the Company or whether any effects will be material. The NAIC generally formulates and promulgates statutory-based insurance regulations. However, each state is independent and must separately enact these financial regulations and guidelines. As such, insurers follow the interpretations and legal approvals of their respective states of domicile.\nOther types of regulation that could affect the Company include insurance company investment laws and regulations, state statutory accounting practices, state escheatment practices, anti-trust laws, minimum solvency requirements, state securities laws, federal privacy laws, insurable interest laws, federal money laundering laws, and anti-terrorism laws. Further, because the Company owns and operates real property, state, federal, and local environmental laws could affect the Company. The Company cannot predict what form any future changes in these or other areas of regulation affecting the insurance industry might take or what effect, if any, such proposals might have on the Company if enacted into law.\nThe Company is also subject to various government regulations at the federal level. As a result of economic and market conditions in recent years, the federal government has become increasingly more active in issuing and enforcing regulations. The implementation of these legislative or regulatory requirements may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate, and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions. The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts that new legislation will have and cannot provide assurance that it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nPublicly held companies in general and the financial services industry in particular are sometimes the target of law enforcement investigations and the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny.\nThe financial services industry has become the focus of increased scrutiny by regulatory and law enforcement authorities relating to allegations of improper special payments, price-fixing, bid-rigging, and other alleged misconduct, including payments made by insurers and other financial services providers to brokers and the practices surrounding the placement of insurance business and sales of other financial products.\nNew accounting rules or changes to existing accounting rules could negatively impact the financial results of the Company.\nLike all publicly traded companies, the Company is required to comply with GAAP. A number of organizations are instrumental in the development and interpretation of GAAP, such as the SEC, the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and the Public Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).\nGAAP is subject to constant review by these organizations and others in an effort to address emerging accounting issues and develop interpretative accounting guidance on a continual basis. The implementation of new accounting guidance could result in substantial costs and or changes in assumptions or estimates, which could negatively impact the results of operations for the Company. Accordingly, the Company can give no assurance that future changes to GAAP or the required adherence to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will not have a negative impact on the Company.\nIn addition, the Company is required to comply with statutory accounting principles (SAP). SAP and various components of SAP, such as statutory actuarial reserving methodology, are subject to constant review by the NAIC, NAIC task forces and committees, as well as state insurance departments to address emerging issues and otherwise improve or modify financial reporting. Various proposals are typically pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC. If enacted, some of these may negatively affect the Company. The NAIC also typically works to reform state regulation in various areas, including reforms relating to life insurance reserves and the accounting for such reserves. The Company cannot predict whether or in what manner reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect the Company. Although states generally defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of the state of domicile with regards to regulations and guidelines, neither the action of the domiciliary state nor action of the NAIC is binding on any other state. Accordingly, a state could choose to follow a different interpretation. The Company can give no assurance that future changes to SAP or components of SAP will not have a negative impact on the Company.\nChanges to tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could adversely affect the Company and its ability to compete with non-insurance products or could reduce the demand for certain insurance products.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), income tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of certain life insurance and annuity products. This favorable tax treatment may give certain of the Company\u2019s products a competitive advantage over other non-insurance products. To the extent that the Code is revised to reduce the tax-deferred status of life insurance and annuity products or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing products, all life insurance companies, including the Company, would be adversely affected with respect to their ability to sell such products. Further, depending upon grandfathering provisions, life insurance companies would be affected by the surrenders of existing annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Changes in tax law, which have reduced the federal income tax rates on corporate dividends in certain circumstances, could make the tax advantages of investing in certain life insurance or annuity products less attractive. Additionally, changes in tax law based on proposals to establish new tax-advantaged retirement and life savings plans, if enacted, could reduce the tax advantage of investing in certain life insurance or annuity products. The Company cannot predict what changes to tax law or interpretations of existing tax law may ultimately be enacted or whether such changes could adversely affect the Company.\nLitigation Risk:\nFinancial services companies are frequently the targets of litigation, including class action litigation, which could result in substantial judgments.\nA number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers, broker-dealers, and other providers of financial services involving sales or claims practices; alleged agent misconduct; failure to properly supervise representatives; relationships with agents or other persons with whom the insurer does business; and other matters. Often these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive non-economic compensatory damages. In some states, juries, judges, and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive and non-economic compensatory damages, which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration. Arbitration awards are subject to very limited appellate review. In addition, in some class actions and other lawsuits, companies have made material settlement payments.\nThe Company, like other financial services companies, is involved in litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company makes every effort to appropriately accrue liability for litigation and other legal proceedings, the outcome of such matters (including any amount of settlement, judgment, or fine) is inherently difficult to predict. As a result, an adverse development or an increase in associated legal fees could have a negative impact on the financial condition of the Company.\nCatastrophic Event Risk:\nThe Company is exposed to the risks of climate change, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, or other acts that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nWhile the Company has implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, no predictions of specific scenarios can be made nor can assurance be given that there are not scenarios that could have an adverse effect on the Company. Climate change, a natural disaster, a pandemic, or an outbreak of an easily communicable disease could adversely affect the mortality or morbidity experience of the Company or its reinsurers. A pandemic could also have an adverse effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies. In addition, a pandemic could result in large areas being subject to quarantine, with the result that economic activity slows or ceases, adversely affecting the marketing or administration of the Company\u2019s business. These effects, in turn, could have an adverse financial effect on the Company. The possible macroeconomic effects of climate change, natural disasters, or pandemics could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s asset portfolio, as well as many other variables.\nInformation Technology Risk:\nThe failure of the Company\u2019s cyber-security or other information system security controls or those of the Company's third-party providers may result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential corporate or customer information. Such failures could damage the Company's reputation and hinder its ability to conduct business. The Company's contingency planning and disaster recovery programs may be insufficient to address unanticipated events. In addition, the Company's reputation could be damaged by inaccurate presentations made in social media.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s normal course of business, the Company uses computer systems to collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential corporate and customer information. In addition, the Company uses third-party vendors and cloud technology on a limited basis for storage, processing, and data support of certain activities. The Company relies on commercial technologies and third parties to maintain the security of that information. The Company's information systems are subject to computer viruses, malicious software code, or other unauthorized computer-related actions. The Company is not aware of any material breach of cybersecurity, administrative, or technical controls having occurred. However, preventive actions taken by the Company to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect the Company's information may be insufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by the Company could severely damage its reputation, expose it to an increase in the risk of litigation, disrupt its operations, cause incurrence of significant technical, legal, and operating expenses, or otherwise harm its business.\nThe Company is highly dependent on its ability to access its computer systems to perform the necessary business functions, such as processing premium payments, processing claim payments, administration of policy data, providing customer support, managing its investment portfolio, and conducting financial reporting and analysis. Events such as natural disasters, pandemics, blackouts, computer viruses, terrorist attacks, or cyber attacks could result in system failures or outages that may cause the Company's computer systems to become inaccessible to its employees and customers for an extended period of time. The Company's disaster recovery program may be insufficient to deal with such an unanticipated event. This could result in an adverse impact to the Company's ability to conduct business functions in a timely manner and could result in a failure to maintain the security and confidentiality of sensitive data, including personal information of customers. This could also result in damage to the Company's\nability to conduct business, damage to the Company's reputation, result in substantial remediation costs, and subject the Company to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, or other unidentified consequences.\nWhile the Company has limited social media content, it recognizes that social media outlets are independent of the Company and its security measures. Inaccurate presentations based upon incorrect information or assumptions could be distributed via social media outlets and could harm the Company and its reputation.\nReinsurance Risks:\nSignificant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for, reinsurance.\nProlonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs, and ultimately, reinsurers not being willing to offer coverage. If the Company was unable to maintain its current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts considered sufficient, the Company would either have to be willing to accept an increase in net exposures or revise pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums. If this were to occur, the Company may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or may not be able to price new business at competitive rates.\nThe Company\u2019s reinsurers could fail to meet assumed obligations or be subject to adverse developments that could affect the Company.\nThe Company follows the insurance practice of reinsuring a portion of the risks under the policies written by the Company (known as ceding). The Company cedes significant amounts of insurance to other insurance companies through reinsurance. This reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the Company for the reinsured portion of the risk. However, reinsurance does not discharge the Company from its primary obligation to pay policyholders for losses insured under the policies that are issued. Therefore, the Company is subject to the credit risk of reinsurers and the failure of one or more of the Company\u2019s reinsurers could negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete is dependent on the availability of reinsurance, cost of reinsurance, or other substitute capital market solutions.\nPremium rates charged by the Company are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges the Company for the reinsurance. Therefore, if the cost of reinsurance were to increase for existing business, or if reinsurance were to become unavailable for new business, or if alternatives to reinsurance were not available, the Company could be adversely affected.\nRecently, access to reinsurance has become more costly for the Company, as well as the insurance industry in general. In recent years, the number of life reinsurers has decreased as the reinsurance industry has consolidated. The decreased number of participants in the life reinsurance market results in increased concentration risk for insurers, including the Company. If the reinsurance market further contracts, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to offer its products on terms favorable to the Company could be adversely impacted.\nThe use of reinsurance introduces variability in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe timing of premium payments to and receipt of expense allowances from reinsurers may differ from the Company\u2019s receipt of customer premium or deposit payments and incurrence of expenses. Further, the administration of reinsurance arrangements introduces risk of operational error and judgment that can be challenged by the counterparty. As a result, reinsurance introduces variability in certain components of the Company\u2019s financial statements including, but not limited to, cash flows and potential liquidity concerns.\nThe Company\u2019s administration of reinsurance contracts introduces potential variability in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nReinsurance contracts provide provisions that are subject to interpretation by the parties to the agreement. The administration of these agreements introduces a risk of operational error or a risk of conflicting judgments that may be challenged by the counterparty. As a result, the administration of reinsurance contracts could introduce variability in certain components of the Company\u2019s financial statements including, but not limited to premiums, policyholder benefits, cash flows and potential liquidity concerns.", "PERMNO": 47088, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "KCLI"}
