{"cik": "1004673", "company": "Entertainment Gaming Asia Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn this report we make, and from time-to-time we may also make, either written or oral statements regarding our business and prospects, such as projections of future performance, statements of management\u2019s plans and objectives, forecasts of market trends, and other matters that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements containing the words or phrases \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which may appear in documents, reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, written or oral presentations made by our officers or other representatives appointed by us to analysts, stockholders, investors, news organizations and others, and may also appear during any discussions between such persons and our management or any of our representatives. For such statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nOur future results, including results related to forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. No assurance can be given that the results reflected in any forward-looking statements will be achieved. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that are sometimes based upon estimates, data, communications and other information from suppliers, government agencies and other sources that may be subject to revision. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or keep current either: (i) any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statement; or (ii) the important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or which are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement.\nIn addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include those set out below.\nWe have a history of operating losses. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Further, we remain subject to the risks inherent in any developing business, including those mentioned below. While we will endeavor to generate positive cash flows from operations and net income, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nDue to the nature of our slot operations, the actions of our venue owners with which we partner could impact our financial performance. Our slot operations, which involve the ownership and leasing of EGMs on a revenue sharing basis in certain countries in Asia, are presently the primary contributor to earnings. These operations focus on targeting venue owners who have little or no gaming operations experience. Since we participate on a revenue sharing basis with these venue owners, our revenue generated from these agreements will be dependent to a significant degree on the efforts and capabilities of the venue owners. Our revenues and results from the slot operations may be impacted by the ability of the venue owners to manage the gaming operations of their venues. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that the venue owners will be able to manage the gaming operations successfully or that the gaming venues operated by them will perform at levels consistent with our financial projections and underlying forecasts and assumptions. Further, we have limited past business relationships with certain of the venue owners and, despite background checks and other due diligence that we may perform, the venue owners may not be reputable. In the event that any of the venue owners are not reputable, this would expose us to the risk of being unable to collect the revenue to which we are entitled under the revenue share arrangements and protect our gaming machine assets.\nOur gaming operations are presently concentrated in Cambodia and the Philippines, which means our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic or political developments in either country. Our business model contemplates the development of slot operations in Pan-Asia and casino development business in Indo-China, however at the present time our gaming operations are located solely in Cambodia and the Philippines. As a result, we experience significant exposure to the business concentration risks presented by the economies and regulatory environments of these two countries. The governments of Cambodia and the Philippines exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of their respective countries\u2019 economy through regulations and, in some cases, state-ownership. Our ability to operate in Cambodia and the Philippines may be harmed by changes in the local laws and regulations, including those relating to gaming, taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In the Philippines, with the exception of major integrated resorts in the Manila area, almost all gaming operations are controlled by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, or PAGCOR, a government corporation that holds the exclusive right to operate slot rooms in the Philippines, which reports directly to the Office of the President of the Philippines. While we have no reason to believe at this time any of our gaming operations or partners are facing the risk of any adverse government action in Cambodia or the Philippines, the central or local governments of such jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure compliance with such regulations or interpretations or which may even restrict the licenses under which we and our partners operate. Likewise, any political turmoil, adverse weather condition, calamity or epidemic occurs in any of these two countries would have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial performance.\nOur financial performance for our slot operations in NagaWorld, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong listed NagaCorp Ltd. (HKSE: 3918), was negatively impacted for periods during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 due, in part, to organized protests in Cambodia\u2019s capital of Phnom Penh. These protests related to the country\u2019s national elections held in July 2013 and general labor unrest. Revenue from our slot operations in NagaWorld declined to approximately $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from approximately $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOur slot participation contracts typically operate under terms ranging from three to six years and are subject to renewal risk. Our slot participation contracts operate under varying contract durations, typically three to six years, and we have a dependence on certain of these operations, specifically NagaWorld. In NagaWorld, our slot operations largely focus on operating a substantial portion of the gaming machine area in prime casino floor locations. As of December 31, 2014, we had 670 EGMs under contract in NagaWorld, representing approximately 39% of our total EGMs placed for our slot business as of that date, and those machines are among our highest performing units on a net win per day basis. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our operations in NagaWorld accounted for approximately 52% of consolidated revenue and approximately 70% of revenue from slot operations.\nIf we choose to renew contracts with certain venue owners or, in the case of one venue in the Philippines, with PAGCOR, there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these contracts under similar conditions, if at all. Absent significant improvement in our existing operations and/or securing new successful projects, the loss of any contracts that are material contributors to our earnings, such as the NagaWorld contact which will expire in March 2016, would have a significant negative impact on our financial performance.\nWe could require additional funding in the future to execute gaming development plans. As of December 31, 2014, we had working capital of approximately $21.6 million. Since December 31, 2014, working capital has been positively affected by solid cash flow contributions from gaming operations, particularly the NagaWorld slot operations, net of capital expenditures incurred for gaming equipment.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash on hand to fulfill all current obligations as they become due and to fund equipment purchase plans and maintenance for both the gaming operations and gaming products businesses. Based on internal revenue projections, existing EGM placement rollout plans and our inventory of EGMs, we believe we have the needed capital to fund existing operations over the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital within the next 12 months if we were to: commit to a large development project, the concurrent development of multiple casino and gaming projects or a new project that requires large upfront payments; experience a shortfall in internal earnings projections; become required to procure additional EGMs for projects; or require capital for reasons not currently contemplated. We would endeavor to raise funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity and debt securities and the procurement of commercial debt financing. However, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand or continue our business as desired and operating results may be adversely affected. Any debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the following results can occur:\n\u00b7 the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced;\n\u00b7 our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share; and/or\n\u00b7 the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nPotential expansion of operations into new businesses and/or markets could represent material additions to our business model, which have not been proven by us. In May 2010, we announced plans to expand the gaming operations and become an owner and operator of regional casinos and gaming venues under our Dreamworld brand in certain emerging gaming markets in Indo-China. Our first Dreamworld project, Dreamworld Casino (Pailin), was not successful and was closed in June 2014. Since then, we have refined our strategy to focus on gaming development projects in more established markets in emerging gaming markets in Asia. In addition, we may pursue additional opportunities in new gaming businesses and/or markets in Asia. While we believe that as an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Melco, we have improved access to such new opportunities, there is no guarantee we will be successful in securing these projects, funding these projects and/or executing plans to build and/or operate any of these projects. Since we do not have a prior history in the above-mentioned projects, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate these prospective operations. Further, we remain subject to the risks inherent in any developing business, including those mentioned herein. Some of our assumptions will invariably not materialize and some unanticipated events and circumstances may affect other assumptions. Therefore, the actual results achieved may vary from the pro forma projections considered by management, and the variations may be material. No assurance can be given that the future results of the above-mentioned potential operations will meet with consumer acceptance or market success.\nOur slot operations and gaming venue development operations are focused in markets outside the United States, which exposes us to risks inherent in international business operations. We intend to pursue slot operations and gaming development projects in certain markets in Pan-Asia. We also focus our sales efforts for gaming products, primarily gaming chips and plaques, in Asia and Australia. However, these efforts may not be successful. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u00b7 increased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 heightened price sensitivity from customers in emerging markets;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish local manufacturing, support and service functions;\n\u00b7 localization of our EGMs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u00b7 compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 laws favoring local competitors;\n\u00b7 weaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u00b7 market disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States, such as Avian flu, SARS and other diseases;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions; and\n\u00b7 changing regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and agreements with third parties throughout Pan-Asia. Our activities in Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Our success in business, in particular, in relation to our gaming chips and plaques products, is impacted by maintaining the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete may be damaged, and our revenues may be reduced if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. To protect these rights, we rely principally on a combination of:\n\u00b7 contractual arrangements providing for non-disclosure and prohibitions on use;\n\u00b7 patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 trade secret, copyright and trademark laws; and\n\u00b7 certain built-in technical product features.\nPatent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws provide limited protection. The protections provided by laws governing intellectual property rights do not prevent competitors from developing, independently, products similar or superior to our products and technologies. In addition, effective protection of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other proprietary rights may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We may be unaware of certain non-publicly available patent applications, which, if issued as patents, could relate to our services and products as currently designed or as we may modify them in the future. Legal or regulatory proceedings to enforce our patents, trademarks or copyrights could be costly, time consuming, and could divert the attention of management and technical personnel.\nMelco International Development Ltd., through its subsidiary EGT Entertainment Holding Limited, is a majority owner of our common stock, giving Melco control over our management and all shareholder actions. On November 25, 2014, EGT Entertainment, a Hong Kong corporation indirectly wholly-owned by Melco, a Hong Kong corporation listed on the main board of Hong Kong Stock Exchange, purchased 6,515,574 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.16 per share in connection with our subscription rights offering, and is now the majority owner of our Company with approximately 64.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the date of this report. Given its equity ownership, Melco has the ability to elect all members of our board directors and approve (or defeat) all matters that come before the stockholders for approval.\nAs a result of Melco\u2019s majority ownership of our company, we have become a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, thereby allowing us to elect out of certain corporate governance requirements mandated by the NASDAQ. As a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d, within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, we can elect out of certain corporate governance requirements of Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules that would otherwise require us to have:\n\u00b7 A majority of independent directors on the board of directors;\n\u00b7 Compensation of our executive officers determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7 Director nominees selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors.\nAll other corporate governance requirements under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules continue to apply.\nWe have elected to take advantage of our \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status and have elected out of the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors. On March 5, 2015, our board of directors appointed Dennis (Chi Wai) Tam to serve on the board. Mr. Tam currently serves as the Group Finance Director and Head of Human Resources & Administration of Melco and, therefore, is not considered to be an independent director within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Upon Mr. Tam\u2019s appointment to our board of directors, we have six members of our board of directors, of which three, or 50%, have been determined by our board to be independent under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As of the date of this report, we do not intend to elect out of any other corporate governance requirements under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors. We are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, the disclosures we are required to provide in our SEC filings are less than it would be if we were not considered to be a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that a fully liquid market will develop or be sustained. Our common shares are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cEGT\u201d. However, we consider our common stock to be \u201cthinly traded\u201d and any last reported sale prices may not be a true market-based valuation of the common stock. Also, the present volume of trading in our common stock may not provide investors sufficient liquidity in the event you wish to sell your common shares. There can be no assurance that an active market for our common stock will develop. In addition, the stock market in general, and lower market cap public companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. If we are unable to develop a fully liquid market for our common shares, you may not be able to sell your common shares at prices you consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for you, or at all.\nOur board of directors may issue blank check preferred stock, which may affect the voting rights of our holders and could deter or delay an attempt to obtain control of us. The board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in series and to fix and state the voting rights and powers, designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. Preferred stock may rank prior to our common stock with respect to dividends rights, liquidation preferences, or both, and may have full or limited voting rights. Accordingly, issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock and could have the effect of deterring or delaying an attempt to obtain control of us.", "PERMNO": 90176, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "EGT"}
