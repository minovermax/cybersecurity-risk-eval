Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur ability to grow our company is critically dependent upon the commercial success of CABOMETYX in its approved indications and the further clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of cabozantinib in additional indications.\nWe anticipate that for the foreseeable future, our ability to maintain or meaningfully increase cash flow to fund our business operations and growth will depend upon the continued commercial success of CABOMETYX as a treatment for\nadvanced RCC and previously treated HCC, and possibly for other indications for which cabozantinib is being evaluated in potentially label-enabling clinical trials, if warranted by the data generated from such trials. In this regard, part of our strategy is to pursue additional indications for cabozantinib to increase the number of cancer patients who could benefit from this medicine. However, we cannot be certain that the clinical trials we and our collaboration partners are currently conducting, or may conduct in the future, will demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy in these additional indications to receive regulatory approval in the major commercial markets where CABOMETYX is approved. Even if we and our collaboration partners receive the required regulatory approvals to market cabozantinib for additional indications, we and our collaboration partners may not be able to commercialize CABOMETYX effectively and successfully in these additional indications. If revenue from CABOMETYX decreases or remains flat, or if we are unable to expand the labeled indications in major commercial markets where CABOMETYX is approved, or if we fail to achieve anticipated product royalties and collaboration milestones, we may need to reduce our operating expenses, access other sources of cash or otherwise modify our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on Ipsen and Takeda for the commercial success of CABOMETYX in its approved indications outside of the U.S., and are unable to control the amount or timing of resources expended by these collaboration partners in the commercialization of CABOMETYX in its approved indications outside of the U.S.\nWe rely heavily upon the regulatory, commercial, medical affairs, market access and other expertise and resources of our collaboration partners, Ipsen and Takeda, for commercialization of CABOMETYX in their respective territories outside of the U.S. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our collaboration partners dedicate to the commercialization of CABOMETYX, or to its marketing and distribution, and our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of CABOMETYX by our collaboration partners depends on their ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, achieve market acceptance of, and to otherwise effectively market, CABOMETYX in its approved indications in their respective territories. Further, foreign sales of CABOMETYX by our collaboration partners could be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental price or other controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions or barriers and changes in tariffs, escalating global trade and political tensions, or otherwise. If our collaboration partners are unable to, or do not invest the resources necessary to successfully commercialize CABOMETYX in the EU and other international territories where it has been approved, this could reduce the amount of revenue we are due to receive under these collaboration agreements, thus resulting in harm to our business and operations.\nOur ability to grow revenues from sales of CABOMETYX will depend upon the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payers, and the medical community.\nOur ability to increase or maintain revenues from sales of CABOMETYX for its approved indications is, and if approved for additional indications will be, highly dependent upon the extent of market acceptance of CABOMETYX among physicians, patients, government health care payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health care plans and the medical community. Market acceptance for CABOMETYX could depend on numerous factors, including the effectiveness and safety profile, or perceived effectiveness and safety profile, of CABOMETYX compared to competing products, the strength of CABOMETYX sales and marketing efforts, and changes in pricing and reimbursement for CABOMETYX. If CABOMETYX does not continue to be prescribed broadly for the treatment of its approved RCC and HCC indications, our product revenues could flatten or decrease, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may develop products and technologies that impair the relative value of our marketed products and any future product candidates.\nThe biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change and diverse offerings of products, particularly in the area of novel oncology therapies. Many of our competitors have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, deeper regulatory expertise and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may afford them a competitive advantage. Further, our competitors may be more effective at in-licensing and developing new commercial products that could render our products, and those of our collaboration partners, obsolete and noncompetitive. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing scientific and clinical research activities similar to ours.\nFurthermore, the specific indications for which CABOMETYX is currently or may be approved, based on the results from clinical trials currently evaluating cabozantinib, are highly competitive. Several novel therapies and combinations of therapies have been approved, are in advanced stages of clinical development or are under expedited regulatory review in these indications, and these other therapies are currently competing or are expected to compete with CABOMETYX. We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of ICIs. While we have adapted our cabozantinib development strategy to address the use of therapies that combine ICIs with other targeted agents in indications for which CABOMETYX is approved, we cannot ensure that our clinical trials will show efficacy in comparison to competing product combinations. Moreover, the complexities of such a development strategy have required and are likely to continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our internal sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities for our products, we may be unable to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities requires significant resources, and there are numerous risks involved with maintaining and continuously improving such a commercial organization, including our potential inability to successfully recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel. We are competing for talent with numerous commercial- and pre-commercial-stage oncology-focused biotechnology companies seeking to build out and maintain their commercial organizations, as well as other large pharmaceutical organizations that have extensive, well-funded and more experienced sales and marketing operations, and we may be unable to maintain or adequately scale our commercial organization as a result of such competition. Also, to the extent that the commercial opportunities for CABOMETYX grow over time, we may not properly scale the size and experience of our commercialization teams to market and sell CABOMETYX successfully in an expanded number of indications. If we are unable to maintain or scale our commercial function appropriately, we may not be able to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to store, distribute and commercialize our products, we may be unable to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to adequately distribute the products to eligible patients. We currently rely on third-party providers for storage and collaboration partners for ongoing and further commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in their respective territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs (or similar programs).\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon the activities, support, and legal and regulatory compliance of third parties may adversely affect our ability to supply CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ on a timely and competitive basis. These third parties may not provide timely services, and we may be unable to maintain or renew our arrangements with these third parties or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to contract for these third-party services on acceptable terms, our commercialization efforts and those of our collaboration partners may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nOur ability to commercialize our products successfully is highly dependent on the extent to which health insurance coverage and reimbursement is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Third-party payers continue to scrutinize and manage access to pharmaceutical products and services and may limit reimbursement for newly approved products and indications. Patients are generally not capable of paying for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ themselves and rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, the costs of their medications, among other medical costs. Accordingly, market acceptance of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ is dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is available from third-party payers. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, our revenues and results of operations will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or\nCOMETRIQ, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans, which often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased, may not be sufficient for patients to afford CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Should our compliance controls prove ineffective at preventing or mitigating the risk and impact of improper conduct or inaccurate reporting, the laws that could impact our operations include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal AKS, which governs our business activities, including our marketing practices, medical educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA and its implementing regulations, which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated or misbranded;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and business associates that access such information on behalf of a covered entity;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws;\n\u2022\nthe PPACA Open Payments program, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by such law) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nstate and local laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to marketing activities, payments and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities, as well as state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and\n\u2022\nstate pharmaceutical price and price reporting laws and regulations that require us to provide notice of price increases or the introduction of new high-cost products, and/or file complex ancillary reports concerning prices and pricing and discount practices.\nIn addition, we may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, medical professionals employed by national healthcare programs) and its foreign equivalents, as well as federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nThese federal and state healthcare laws and regulations govern pharmaceutical marketing practices, including off-label promotion. If our operations are found, or even alleged, to be in violation of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, regulatory penalties, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, reputational harm, additional reporting requirements and oversight, any of which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products and operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. Of particular concern are suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, which can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. Under the False Claims Act, these individuals, commonly known as relators or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may potentially share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the civil False Claims Act, or settles a lawsuit brought pursuant to the False Claims Act to avoid further prosecution, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require\nsignificant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, if any such action is brought against us, our business may be impaired, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the U.S. healthcare system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.\nFederal and state governments in the U.S. are considering legislative and regulatory proposals to change the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to continue to commercialize CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ profitably. Similarly, among policy makers and payers, there is significant interest in promoting such changes with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding patient access. The pharmaceutical industry and specifically the market for the sale, insurance coverage and distribution of pharmaceuticals has been a particular focus of these efforts and would likely be significantly affected by any major legislative or regulatory initiatives.\nWe face related uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. Notably, in December 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the penalty enforcing the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Then, in December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld this District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals and other efforts will impact the PPACA. Additionally, the 2019 year-end federal spending package permanently repealed, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device taxes, and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. There is no assurance that the repeal or modification of some or all of the provisions of the PPACA in the future, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn addition, there are pending federal and state-level legislative proposals that would significantly expand government-provided health insurance coverage, ranging from establishing a single-payer, national health insurance system to more limited \u201cbuy-in\u201d options to existing public health insurance programs, each of which could have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. While we cannot predict how future legislation (or enacted legislation that has yet to be implemented) will affect our business, such proposals could have the potential to impact access to and sales of our products.\nAs a result of these developments and trends, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. Insurers are also pursuing means of contracting for pharmaceutical \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201coutcomes.\u201d These entities could refuse, limit or condition coverage for our products, such as by using tiered reimbursement or pressing for new forms of value-based contracting, which could adversely affect product sales. Furthermore, the expansion of the 340B Drug Discount Program has increased the number of purchasers eligible for significant discounts on branded drugs, including our marketed products. Due to the volatility in the current regulatory and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, including potential cost containment and healthcare reform measures. If enacted, any such measures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPricing for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. has come under increasing attention and scrutiny by federal and state governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that have the effect of reducing our revenue or harming our business or reputation.\nThere have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things: reduce or limit the prices of drugs and make them more affordable for patients; reform the structure and financing of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits, including through increasing manufacturer contributions to offset Medicare beneficiary costs; bring more transparency to drug pricing rationale and methodologies; and facilitate the importation of certain lower-cost drugs from other countries. While we cannot know the final form of any such legislative, regulatory and/or administrative measures, some of the pending legislative proposals, such as those incorporating International Pricing Index models, if enacted, would likely have a significant and far-reaching impact on the biopharmaceutical industry and therefore also likely have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with its evaluation of proposals concerning the pricing of, and access to, pharmaceutical products, many companies in our industry have received governmental requests for documents and information relating to drug\npricing and patient support programs. We could receive a similar request, which would require us to incur significant expense and result in distraction for our management team. Additionally, to the extent there are findings, or even allegations, of improper conduct on the part of the company, these findings could further harm our business, reputation and/or prospects.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative.\nFor example, California adopted SB-17, which requires, among other provisions, pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide notice of price increases above a defined threshold to certain purchasers and related reports to the government. Such obligations to provide notices of price increases to purchasers may influence customer ordering patterns for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, which in turn may increase the volatility of our revenues as a reflection of changes in inventory volumes. Furthermore, adoption of drug pricing transparency regulations, and our associated compliance obligations, may increase general and administrative costs and/or diminish our revenues as a result of the imposition of caps on pricing and price increases. Therefore, the implementation of these cost-containment measures or other healthcare reforms may result in fluctuations in our results of operations and limit our ability to generate product revenue or commercialize our products.\nLengthy regulatory pricing and reimbursement procedures and cost control initiatives imposed by governments outside the U.S. could delay the marketing of and/or result in downward pressure on the price of our approved products resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nOutside the U.S., particularly in the EU, the pricing and reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals is generally subject to governmental control. In EU countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities or payers can take six to 12 months or longer after the initial marketing authorization is granted for a product, or after the marketing authorization for a new indication is granted. This can substantially delay broad availability of the product. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, our collaboration partner Ipsen may also be required to conduct a study that seeks to establish the cost effectiveness of CABOMETYX compared with other available established therapies. The conduct of such a study could also result in delays in the commercialization of CABOMETYX. Additionally, cost-control initiatives, increasingly based on affordability, could decrease the price we and Ipsen might establish for CABOMETYX, which would result in lower license revenues to us.\nEnhanced governmental and private scrutiny over, or investigations or litigation involving, pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nTo help patients afford our products, we have a patient assistance program and also occasionally make donations to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients. These types of programs designed to assist patients with affording pharmaceuticals have become the subject of Congressional interest and enhanced government scrutiny. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General established specific guidelines permitting pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations that provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that manufacturers meet certain specified compliance requirements. If we are deemed not to have complied with these guidelines and other laws or regulations respecting the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. A variety of entities, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, but not including our company, have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice and other enforcement authorities seeking information related to their patient assistance programs and support. Regardless of whether we have complied with the regulations governing patient assistance programs, this type of government investigation could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and the collection and processing of personal data. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could create additional liabilities for us.\nThe legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve globally and in the U.S. For example, the CCPA went into operation on January 1, 2020 and affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, including civil penalties for violations and statutory damages under a private right of action for data security\nbreaches. Similar legislative proposals being advanced in other states and Congress is also considering federal privacy legislation. In addition, most healthcare providers are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly encourage, assist or otherwise facilitate a HIPAA-covered entity (or its business associate) to use or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. For example, the GDPR regulates the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU, even if, under certain circumstances, that processing occurs outside the EU, and also restricts transfers of such data to countries outside of the EU, including the U.S. Should we fail to provide adequate privacy or data security protections or maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to sanctions or other penalties, litigation or an increase in our cost of doing business.\nLegislation and regulatory action designed to facilitate the development, approval and adoption of generic drugs in the U.S., and the entrance of generic competitors, could limit the commercial potential of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the applicant undertaking the human clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. The FDA can also approve an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that relies in whole or in part on the agency\u2019s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Both the ANDA and 505(b)(2) processes are discussed in more detail above in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the heading \u201cGovernment Regulation-FDA Review and Approval.\u201d In either case, if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submits an application referencing one of our marketed products prior to the expiry of one or more our Orange Book-listed patents for the applicable product, we may litigate with the potential generic competitor to protect our patent rights, which would result in significant expenses, distraction for our management team, and could have an adverse impact on our stock price. For example, in September 2019, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from MSN that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets, and we subsequently filed a patent infringement lawsuit against MSN on October 29, 2019. It is possible that MSN or other companies, following FDA approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, could introduce generic versions of our marketed products before our patents expire if they do not infringe our patents or if it is determined that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, and we expect that generic cabozantinib products would be offered at a significantly lower price compared to our marketed cabozantinib products. Therefore, regardless of the regulatory approach, the introduction of a generic version of cabozantinib could significantly decrease our revenues and thereby materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government has also taken numerous legislative and regulatory actions to expedite the development and approval of generic drugs and biosimilars. In August 2017, President Trump signed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorized the FDA user fee programs for prescription drugs, generic drugs, medical devices, and biosimilars, under which applicants for such products partially pay for the FDA\u2019s pre-market review of their product candidates and pay other specified fees. The legislation also includes, inter alia, measures to expedite the development and approval of generic products, where generic competition is lacking even in the absence of exclusivities or listed patents. In addition, the FDA has also released a Drug Competition Action Plan, which proposes actions to broaden access to generic drugs and lower consumers\u2019 health care costs by, among other things, improving the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and supporting the development of complex generic drugs, and the FDA has taken steps to implement this plan. Moreover, both Congress and the FDA are considering various legislative and regulatory proposals focused on drug competition, including legislation focused on drug patenting and provision of drug to generic applicants for testing. For example, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act of 2019, recently signed into law as part of the 2019 year-end federal spending package, purports to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, including by allowing generic manufacturers access to branded drug samples. While we cannot predict the specific outcome or impact on our business of such regulatory actions or legislation, they do have the potential to facilitate the development and future approval of generic versions of our products, or otherwise limit or reduce the term for our market exclusivity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClinical testing of cabozantinib for new indications, or of new potential product candidates, is a lengthy, costly, complex and uncertain process and may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that cabozantinib, despite its approval for certain indications, or a new potential product candidate, is ineffective or has an unacceptable safety profile with respect to an intended use. Such results may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval in a particular indication. Moreover, the results of\npreliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and late-stage or other potentially label-enabling clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in early-stage trials or preliminary studies. Although we have established timelines for manufacturing and clinical development of cabozantinib and our other product candidates based on existing knowledge of our compounds in development and industry metrics, we may not be able to meet those timelines.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events, during or as a result of clinical testing, that could delay or prevent commercialization of cabozantinib in new indications, or of our other product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy or a tolerable safety profile;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive clinical trial results that require us to conduct further testing or to abandon projects;\n\u2022\ndiscovery or commercialization by our competitors of other compounds or therapies that show significantly improved safety or efficacy compared to cabozantinib or our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites;\n\u2022\nlower-than-anticipated patient registration or enrollment in our clinical testing, including in China as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak;\n\u2022\nfailure by our collaboration partners to provide us with an adequate and timely supply of product that complies with the applicable quality and regulatory requirements for a combination trial;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party contract research organizations or investigators to satisfy their contractual obligations, including deviating from any trial protocols; and\n\u2022\nwithholding of authorization from regulators or institutional review boards to commence or conduct clinical trials or delays, suspensions or terminations of clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a determination by these regulators and institutional review boards that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nIf there are significant delays in or termination of the clinical testing of cabozantinib or our other product candidates as a result of any of the events described above or otherwise, our expenses could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired, either of which could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we rely on our collaboration partners to fund a significant portion of our clinical development programs. Should one or all of our collaboration partners decline to support future planned clinical trials, we will be entirely responsible for financing the further development of cabozantinib or our other product candidates and, as a result, we may be unable to execute our current business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to pursue the further development of cabozantinib or our other product candidates or meet current or future requirements of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions in accordance with our stated timelines or at all. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on schedule, or at all, may not be sufficient for registration of our product candidates or may not result in an approvable product. The duration and the cost of clinical trials vary significantly as a result of factors relating to the clinical trial, including, among others: characteristics of the product candidate under investigation; the number of patients who ultimately participate in the clinical trial; the duration of patient follow-up ; the number of clinical sites included in the trials; and the length of time required to enroll eligible patients.\nAny delay could limit our ability to generate revenues, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Our partners under our collaboration agreements may experience similar risks with respect to the compounds we have out-licensed to them. If any of the events described above were to occur with such programs or compounds, the likelihood of receipt of milestones and royalties under such collaboration agreements could decrease.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy and uncertain and may not result in regulatory approvals for cabozantinib or our other product candidates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe activities associated with the research, development and commercialization of cabozantinib and our other product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S., as well as by comparable authorities in other countries. The processes of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and they can vary substantially based\nupon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. For example, before an NDA or sNDA can be submitted to the FDA, or a MAA to the EMA or any application or submission to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and require substantial expenditures.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or sNDA or decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of cabozantinib for any individual additional indications. In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in policy, which could cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for cabozantinib or for our other product candidates.\nEven if the FDA or a comparable authority in another jurisdiction approves cabozantinib for one or more new indications, such approval may be limited, imposing significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, distribution, and/or production of the product and could impose requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and clinical trials, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our and our collaboration partners\u2019 ability to commercialize cabozantinib in one or more new indications. For example, based on the regulatory feedback from the FDA, and if supported by the clinical data from COSMIC-021, we intend to file with the FDA for accelerated approval of cabozantinib in an mCRPC indication as early as 2021. We expect that as a condition of any potential approval under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, the FDA will require us to perform confirmatory post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinical benefit, if any, of cabozantinib in combination with Roche\u2019s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, such as mCRPC. Failure to complete any post-marketing requirements in accordance with the timelines and conditions set forth by the FDA could significantly increase costs or delay, limit or ultimately restrict the commercialization of cabozantinib in any additional indications. Further, these regulatory agencies could also impose various administrative, civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply successfully with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nWe may be unable to expand our development pipeline, which could limit our growth and revenue potential.\nOur business is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. In this regard, we have invested in substantial technical, financial and human resources toward internal drug discovery activities with the goal of identifying new product candidates to advance into clinical trials. These efforts may initially show promise in identifying product candidates, yet ultimately fail to yield product candidates for multiple reasons. For example, product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have inadequate efficacy, harmful side effects, suboptimal pharmaceutical profiles or other characteristics suggesting that they are unlikely to be commercially viable products.\nApart from our internal drug discovery efforts, our strategy to expand our development pipeline is also dependent on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license relevant product candidates. However, the in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a highly competitive area, and many other companies are pursuing the same or similar product candidates to those that we may consider attractive. In particular, larger companies with more capital resources and more extensive clinical development and commercialization capabilities may have a competitive advantage over us. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates on acceptable terms that would allow us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. If our internal drug discovery or business development efforts do not result in suitable product candidates, our business and prospects for growth could suffer. Even if we succeed in our efforts to obtain rights to suitable product candidates, the competitive business environment may result in higher acquisition or licensing costs, and our investment in these potential products will remain subject to the inherent risks associated with the development and commercialization of new medicines. In certain circumstances, we may also be reliant on the licensor for the continued development of the in-licensed technology and their efforts to safeguard their underlying intellectual property.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate the target company successfully into our existing business, maintain the key business relationships of the target, or retain key personnel of an acquired business. Furthermore, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or incur unanticipated expenses. Any acquisitions or investments made by us also could result in our spending significant amounts, issuing dilutive securities, assuming or incurring significant debt obligations and contingent liabilities, incurring large one-time expenses and acquiring intangible\nassets that could result in significant future amortization expense and significant write-offs, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability and result in harm to our business.\nWe and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. For example, we use Facebook and Twitter to communicate with the medical community and the investing public, although we do not intend to disclose material, nonpublic information through these means. Despite our efforts to monitor social media communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products on social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements, Accounting and Financial Results\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted by our extensive clinical development, business development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and pipeline expansion efforts relative to the revenues we generate.\nAlthough we reported net income of $321.0 million and $690.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we are unable to predict the extent of future profits or losses. The amount of our net profits or losses will depend, in part, on: the level of sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S.; achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, if any, under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda; the amount of royalties from sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda; other collaboration revenues; and the level of our expenses, including development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and any pipeline expansion efforts. We expect to continue to spend significant additional amounts to fund the continued development of cabozantinib for additional indications and the commercialization of our approved products. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our product pipeline through our internal drug discovery efforts and the execution of additional partnerships through business development activities or strategic transactions that align with our oncology drug development, regulatory and commercial expertise, which efforts could involve substantial costs. To offset these costs in the future, we will need to generate substantial revenues. If these costs exceed our current expectations, or we fail to achieve anticipated revenue targets, the market value of our common stock may decline.\nOur financial outlook may not be realized.\nFrom time to time, in press releases and otherwise, we may publish estimates, forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our future financial or operating results, including estimated revenues, expenses and earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous assumptions and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management estimates or forecasts or that the variation from such estimates or forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated estimates or forecasts, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, our products, the competitive landscape for our products, our commercialization, development and regulatory efforts, as well as those of our collaboration partners, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry generally when evaluating our prospective financial or operating results.\nIf additional capital is not available to us when we need it, we may be unable to expand our product offerings and maintain business growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $1.4 billion in cash and investments. Our business operations grew substantially during 2019. In order to maintain business growth in 2020, we plan to continue to execute on our U.S. commercialization plans for CABOMETYX, while reinvesting in our product pipeline through the continued development of cabozantinib and our other product candidates, internal discovery activities and the execution of strategic transactions. Our ability to achieve these business objectives will depend on many factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with maintaining our expanded sales, marketing, market access, medical affairs and product distribution capabilities for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties paid under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of and revenues generated by products marketed under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nthe level of our investments in the expansion of our pipeline through internal drug discovery and business development activities;\n\u2022\nthe number and size of clinical trials we conduct and the cost of drug supply for such clinical trials evaluating our products with other therapeutic agents;\n\u2022\ntrends and developments in the pricing of oncologic therapeutics in the U.S. and abroad, especially in the EU;\n\u2022\nscientific developments in the market for oncologic therapeutics and the timing of regulatory approvals for competing oncologic therapies; and\n\u2022\nthe filing, maintenance, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nOur commitment of cash resources to CABOMETYX and the reinvestment in our product pipeline through the continued development of cabozantinib and increasing internal drug discovery activities, as well as through the execution of strategic transactions, could require us to obtain additional capital. We may seek such additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations; licensing arrangements; and public or private debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets, including any disruptions resulting from government shutdowns, rising interest rate environments, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease (including for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak), increased or changed tariffs and trade restrictions or otherwise, may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets. Economic and capital markets conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. Continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. Accordingly, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be unable to expand our product offerings and maintain business growth, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, certain assumptions and estimates and future changes in accounting standards.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe our critical accounting policies relating to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, inventory and stock-based compensation reflect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, our interpretation of existing accounting literature and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, if our assumptions prove to be materially incorrect, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition, future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations. New pronouncements from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur\nagain in the future and, as a result, we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues and expenses, our other results of operations or our current financial position.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as numerous U.S. states and territories, municipalities, and other local jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from various factors including the mix of earnings and applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate, the accounting for stock options and stock-based awards, and research and development spending. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate, however, may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws, changes in the mix of our earnings from state to state, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, or our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities. Any of these factors could cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $675 million. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2035 for federal income tax purposes and 2020 for state income tax purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carryforwards before utilization. Based on our review and analysis, we concluded, as of December 31, 2019, that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382, had not occurred. However, if there is an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in the future, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating losses. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our net operating losses is conditioned upon our maintaining profitability and generating U.S. federal taxable income.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nFollowing the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement by the European Parliament and UK Parliament, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The Withdrawal Agreement provides for a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which the UK remains in the single market and customs union and the free movement of people will continue, in order to ensure frictionless trade and business continuity until a long-term relationship is agreed. At the end of transition, the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will be determined by the new agreements it has entered into on trade and other areas of cooperation. The new agreements must be reached before the transition period ends. If not, the UK would have to rely on previous international conventions for security cooperation and would trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms. The exception is Northern Ireland, whose trade in goods with the EU would be covered by the provisions in the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications Brexit will have and how it might affect us. For example, we rely on third-party contract manufacturing organization facilities located in the UK, responsible for packaging, labeling, storing and subsequently distributing supplies of our product to the EU. Any tariffs, differing regulatory requirements and other restrictions on the free movement of goods between the UK and the EU that ultimately result from Brexit may have an adverse impact on this part of our supply chain. Trade restrictions, changes to the regulatory approval or drug cost reimbursement systems, and additional administrative costs may impede the ability of our collaboration partner Ipsen to market our products in Europe. Furthermore, the initial announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations; therefore, the Brexit transition may continue to adversely affect European and global economic and market conditions, which may cause third-party payers, including governmental organizations, to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets, and which could contribute to instability in the global financial and foreign exchange markets. Any of these effects of Brexit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe are dependent upon our collaborations with major companies, which subject us to a number of risks.\nWe have established collaborations with leading biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, including, Ipsen, Takeda, Roche and Genentech, BMS and Daiichi Sankyo, for the development and ultimate commercialization of our products. Our dependence on our relationships with collaboration partners for the development and commercialization of compounds subjects us to, a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaboration partners or potential future collaboration partners will devote to the development or commercialization of drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that collaboration partners may delay clinical trials, fail to supply us on a timely basis with the product required for a combination trial, deliver product that fails to meet appropriate quality and regulatory standards and results in a market recall or withdrawal, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ndisputes that may arise between us and our collaboration partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that diminish or delay receipt of the economic benefits we are entitled to receive under the collaboration, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our collaboration partners may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners\u2019 lack of success in their efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners\u2019 failure to properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or their use of our intellectual property rights or proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of our collaboration agreements and related ancillary agreements;\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners\u2019 failure to comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as established guidelines, laws and regulations related to GMP, GCP, GDP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our collaboration partners could independently move forward with competing drug candidates, developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into additional collaboration arrangements with third parties in an area or field of exclusivity;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that future collaboration partners may require us to relinquish some important rights, such as marketing and distribution rights; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that collaborations may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay, and may increase the cost of, development of our drug candidates.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not receive collaboration revenues or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from such collaborations and our product development efforts could be delayed, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties upon which we rely to perform clinical trials for cabozantinib in new indications or for new potential product candidates do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials for cabozantinib or for new potential product candidates independently, so we rely on independent third parties for the performance of these trials, such as the U.S. federal government (including NCI-CTEP, a department of the National Institutes of Health, with whom we have our CRADA), third-party contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the third parties must be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they generate or provide is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be\nable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications. In addition, due to the complexity of our research initiatives, we may be unable to engage with third-party contract research organizations that have the necessary experience and sophistication to further our internal drug discovery efforts, which would impede our ability to identify, develop and commercialize our potential product candidates.\nWe lack internal manufacturing capabilities necessary for us to produce our products for clinical development or for commercial sale and rely on third parties to do so, which subjects us to various risks.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of our products. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third-party contract manufacturing organizations that, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. As our operations continue to expand through our clinical development and commercial progress, we continue to appropriately expand our supply chain through secondary third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers.\nTo establish and manage our supply chain requires a significant financial commitment, the creation of numerous third-party contractual relationships and continued oversight of these third parties to fulfill compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Although we maintain significant resources to directly and effectively oversee the activities and relationships with the companies in our supply chain, we do not have direct control over their operations.\nOur third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to produce material on a timely basis or manufacture material with the required quality standards, or in the quantity required to meet our development and commercial needs and applicable regulatory requirements. If our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers do not continue to supply us with our products or product candidates in a timely fashion and in compliance with applicable quality and regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail or refuse to comply with their obligations to us under our supply and manufacturing arrangements, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, their failure to supply us could impair or preclude our ability to meet our commercial supply requirements, or our supply needs for clinical trials, including those being conducted in collaboration with our partners, which could delay our product development efforts and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, through our third-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we continue to provide serialized commercial products as required to comply with the DSCSA. If our third-party contract manufacturers or data service providers fail to support our efforts to continue to comply with DSCSA and any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements, we may face legal penalties or be restricted from selling our products.\nAs part of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, we are responsible for the supply of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ for global development and commercial purposes. Failure to meet our supply obligations under these collaboration agreements could impair our partners\u2019 ability to successfully develop and commercialize CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and generate revenues to which we are entitled under the collaborations.\nIf third-party scientific advisors and contractors we rely on to assist with our drug discovery efforts do not perform as expected, the expansion of our product pipeline may be delayed.\nWe work with scientific advisors at academic and other institutions, as well as third-party contractors in various locations throughout the world, that assist us in our research and development efforts, including in internal drug discovery and preclinical development strategy. These third parties are not our employees and may have other commitments or contractual obligations that limit their availability to us. Although these third-party scientific advisors and contractors generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. There has also been increased scrutiny surrounding the disclosures of payments made to medical researchers from companies in the pharmaceutical industry, and it is possible that the academic and other institutions that employ these medical researchers may prevent us from engaging them as scientific advisors and contractors or otherwise limit our access to these experts, or that the scientific advisors themselves may now be more reluctant to work with industry partners. Even if these scientific advisors and contractors with whom we have engaged intend to meet their contractual obligations, they may be impacted by external factors, including, without limitation, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease. In fact, certain of our contractors located in China have been affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak, which has restricted their ability to perform their contractually obligated services to us. In any of these circumstances, we have or may continue to experience delays in the receipt of services, lose work performed by these scientific advisors and contractors or be unable to engage them in the first place, and our discovery and development efforts with respect to the matters on which they were working or would work in the future may be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nData breaches, cyber attacks and other failures in our information technology infrastructure could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, damage our operations and cause significant harm to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data and personal information) and confidential information with respect to our customers, clinical trial patients and our collaboration partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure to third parties and, as a result, such third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, and while we have enhanced and are continuing to enhance our cybersecurity efforts commensurate with the growth and complexity of our business, our systems and those of third-party service providers may be vulnerable to a cyber attack. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the functioning of our information technology infrastructure to carry out our business processes, such as external and internal communications or access to clinical data and other key business information. Accordingly, both inadvertent disruptions to this infrastructure and cyber attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation or litigation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nNumerous companies have been subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber attacks (including through use of ransomware) and other attempts to gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise information technology systems. In fact, although the aggregate impact of cyber attacks on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we and our third-party vendors have frequently been the target of threats of this nature and expect them to continue. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack, and such threats can also vary in motive (including corporate espionage). Cyber attacks continue to become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against, and it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose our sensitive business information (or sensitive business information of our collaboration partners, which may lead to significant liability for us). A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, employees or others. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation and business, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents (including the GDPR), subject us to investigations and mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant financial exposure. Furthermore, the costs of maintaining or upgrading our cybersecurity systems (including the recruitment and retention of experienced information technology professionals, who are in high demand) at the level necessary to keep up with our expanding operations and prevent against potential attacks are increasing, and despite our best efforts, our network security and data recovery measures and those of our vendors may still not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions, which could cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as, where and when we deem lawful and appropriate. However, these applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Our issued patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties as invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties, and we are from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the U.S. and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation can be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our intellectual property without a\nlicense and/or allow third parties to introduce generic and other competing products, any of which would negatively impact our business. Third parties may also attempt to invalidate or design around our patents, or assert that they are invalid or otherwise unenforceable, and seek to introduce generic versions of cabozantinib. For example, in September 2019, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from MSN that it has filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets, and we subsequently filed a patent infringement lawsuit against MSN on October 29, 2019. Should MSN or any other third parties receive FDA approval of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to cabozantinib, it is possible that such company or companies could introduce generic versions of our marketed products before our patents expire if they do not infringe our patents or if it is determined that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, and the resulting generic competition could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, commercialization or use of our product candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages, if, for example, others were the first to invent or to file patent applications for closely related inventions.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Initiatives seeking compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs are also becoming increasingly prevalent in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products or product candidates, thereby reducing our product sales. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, partners and consultants, we cannot provide assurance that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not to breach any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and the technologies of third parties. Other parties have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop. If patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may require us to pay substantial royalties, grant a cross-license to some of our patents to another patent holder or redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third-party patents, which may be impossible to accomplish or could require substantial time and expense.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes on their patents or otherwise employs their proprietary technology without authorization. Regardless of their merit, such claims could require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel, in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our own patents. In the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from these third parties, subjecting us to substantial royalty payment obligations. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and independent contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or used or sought to use patent inventions belonging to their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel and/or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop or commercialize certain product candidates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Employees and Location\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our operations. This growth places significant demands on our management and resources, and our current and planned personnel and operating practices may not be adequate to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve existing, and implement new, facilities, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls, as well as expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our growth without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. We expect that we may need to increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations, and recruiting and retaining qualified individuals is difficult. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unsuccessful in recruiting qualified management personnel, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to retain and, where necessary, attract additional personnel could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management, as well as clinical, commercial and scientific staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Also, we may not have sufficient personnel to execute our business plans. Retaining and, where necessary, recruiting qualified clinical, commercial, scientific and pharmaceutical operations personnel will be critical to support activities related to advancing the development program for cabozantinib and our other product candidates, successfully executing upon our commercialization plan for cabozantinib and our internal proprietary research and development efforts. Competition is intense for experienced clinical, commercial, scientific and pharmaceutical operations personnel, and we may be unable to retain or recruit such personnel with the expertise or experience necessary to allow us to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Further, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, may leave our employment at any time.\nOur operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur headquarters in Alameda, California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and therefore our facilities are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We have limited earthquake insurance, which may not cover all of the damage we may suffer in the event of an earthquake. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires and floods, which have become a significant danger in California during recent years, as well as power loss, communications failures, aircraft disasters (due to the proximity of our headquarters to a major international airport), terrorism and similar events, and any insurance we may maintain may be inadequate to cover our losses. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired, causing significant delays in our programs and making it difficult for us to recover due to the unique nature of our research activities. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFacility security breaches may disrupt our operations, subject us to liability and harm our operating results.\nAny break-in or trespass at our facilities that results in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, or that results in damage to our research and development equipment and assets, or that results in physical or psychological harm to any of our employees, could subject us to liability or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Product Liability\nWe use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and our operations can produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge, or any resultant injury from these materials, and we may face liability under applicable laws for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by our collaboration partners or other third parties of these materials, and such liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our collaboration partners against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with our collaborations with them. Moreover, our continued compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nWe may be held liable if any product we or our collaboration partners develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials, product recall, substantial monetary awards to third parties and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop in the future. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or testing our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and commercial activities for cabozantinib in the amount of $20.0 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, if insurance coverage becomes more expensive, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits for claims based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. In addition, the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries, in general, have been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could harm our reputation and business and would decrease our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and we believe the trading price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following, many of which we cannot control:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process with respect to cabozantinib, our collaboration partners\u2019 product candidates being developed in combination with cabozantinib, or our competitors\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe commercial performance of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products, including royalties paid under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022\nadverse or inconclusive results or announcements related to our or our collaboration partners\u2019 clinical trials or delays in those clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of achievement of our clinical, regulatory, partnering, commercial and other milestones for cabozantinib or any of our other programs or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to make future investments in the expansion of our pipeline through internal drug discovery and business development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the materials and services, including an adequate product supply for any approved drug product, from our third-party vendors or do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development and manufacturing of cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, with respect to cabozantinib or our clinical trials for cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nunanticipated regulatory actions taken by the FDA as a result of changing FDA standards and practices concerning the review of product candidates, including approvals at earlier stages of clinical development or with lesser developed data sets and expedited reviews;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or clinical trial data by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of regulatory applications, such as MSN\u2019s ANDA, seeking approval of generic versions of our marketed products;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with our collaboration partners, including the termination or modification of our agreements, or other events or conflicts that may affect our collaboration partners\u2019 timing and willingness to develop, or if approved, commercialize our products and product candidates out-licensed to them;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of an in-licensed product candidate or strategic acquisition;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including intellectual property infringement and product liability lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of acquired goodwill and other assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, or financial guidance from our management team, and any failure to achieve the operating results projected by securities analysts or by our management team;\n\u2022\nthe entry into new financing arrangements;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022\nthe disposition of any of our technologies or compounds;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThese factors could have material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. Likewise, as a result of significant changes in U.S. or global political and economic conditions, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease (including for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak), policies governing foreign trade and health care spending and delivery, or future U.S. federal government shutdowns, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the date of this report.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our\nBoard of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 88159, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EXEL"}
