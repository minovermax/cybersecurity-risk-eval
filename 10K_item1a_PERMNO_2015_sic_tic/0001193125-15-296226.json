RISK FACTORS\nFactors That May Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Product Development\nWe have a long history of operating losses and it is likely that our operating expenses will continue to exceed our revenues for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our formation in 1982. As of June 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $309.5 million. We continue to spend our cash resources to fund our research and development programs and, subject to adequate funding, we expect these expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. Our only significant sources of revenue in recent years have been derived from our existing licensing agreement with UCB and the collaboration agreement with Bayer (Algeta). The timing of when we are able to record licensing fee revenue from such agreements has varied historically and may result in quarterly or annual profits or losses that are not necessarily reflective of our business operations or related cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be profitable in future quarters or other periods. Additionally, the only product sales we have earned to date have come from the limited sales of our diagnostic imaging product for which our patent protection has recently expired (which may leave us vulnerable to increased competition, for example, from generic manufacturers). In addition, we have made the strategic decision to de-emphasize sales of\nour diagnostic product and focus on our therapeutic pipeline. We have never had product sales of any therapeutic product. Although we may have net income from time to time based on the timing and amount of proceeds received under collaborative agreements, we expect to experience significant operating losses as we invest further in our research and development activities while simultaneously attempting to develop and commercialize our other therapeutic product candidates. If we are unable to develop commercially viable therapeutic products or to license them to third parties, it is likely that we will never achieve significant revenues or become profitable, either of which would jeopardize our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have significant future capital needs and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our clinical development efforts.\nWe believe we have adequate cash at our current expected spending level to fund our clinical development programs through the next twelve months. However, we will require additional financial resources after we utilize our current liquid assets in order to continue our clinical development programs as is currently forecasted beyond fiscal year 2016. We are actively pursuing various financing alternatives as market conditions permit through licensing and collaborative agreements or additional potential equity or debt financings, if necessary. We continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies. At the present time, we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and, if so, the terms and timing of any definitive agreements.\nOur most advanced therapeutic product candidates are still only in the clinical development stage, and will require us to raise capital in the future in order to fund further expensive and time-consuming studies before they can even be submitted for final regulatory approval. A failure of a clinical trial could severely harm our business and results of operations.\nClinical trials involve the administration of a product candidate to patients who are already extremely ill, making patient enrollment often difficult and expensive. Moreover, even in ideal circumstances where the patients can be enrolled and then followed for the several months or more required to complete the study, the trials can be suspended, terminated, delayed or otherwise fail for any number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nlater-stage clinical trials may raise safety or efficacy concerns not readily apparent in earlier trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in manufacturing the product candidate in compliance with all regulatory requirements and in the quantities needed to complete the trial which may become cost-prohibitive;\n\u2022\nwe or our collaboration partner(s) may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, agreement for the conduct of our clinical trials from FDA, institutional review boards (\u201cIRB\u201cs), or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwhile underway, the continuation of clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to modifications to the clinical trial\u2019s protocols based on interim results obtained or changes required or conditions imposed by the FDA, an IRB, a data and safety monitoring board, or (\u201cDSMB\u201d), or any other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nFDA or other regulatory authorities may impose a clinical hold, for example based an inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe or our collaboration partner(s) may suspend or cease trials in our or their sole discretion;\n\u2022\nduring the long trial process alternative therapies may become available which make further development of the product candidate impracticable; and\n\u2022\nif we are unable to obtain the additional capital we need to fund all of the clinical trials we foresee, we may be forced to cancel or otherwise curtail such trials and other studies.\nOn July 28, 2015, UCB announced that the two Phase 3 EMBODY\u2122 clinical trials for epratuzumab in systemic lupus erythematosus did not meet the primary clinical efficacy endpoints in either dose in both studies. This announcement or substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials for our other product candidates, sacituzumab govitecan and yttrium-90-labeled clivatuzumab tetraxetan, could severely harm our business and results of operations.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to report some of these relationships to FDA. FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between the company and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may not adequately show that our drugs are safe or effective, or a failure to achieve the planned endpoints could result in termination of product development.\nProgression of our drug products through the clinical development process is dependent upon our trials indicating our drugs have adequate safety and efficacy in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined safety and efficacy endpoints according to the trial protocols. Failure to achieve either of these endpoints could result in delays in our trials, require the performance of additional unplanned trials or termination of any further development of the product for the intended indication. For example, with epratuzumab in SLE, the results did not meet the primary clinical efficacy endpoints in either dose in both studies. Treatment response in patients who received epratuzumab in addition to standard therapy was not statistically significant when compared to those who received placebo in addition to standard therapy.\nThese factors could result in delays in the development of our product candidates and could result in significant unexpected costs or the termination of programs.\nShould the clinical development process be successfully completed, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of therapeutics will depend upon our first obtaining FDA as well as foreign regulatory approvals, all of which are subject to a number of unique risks and uncertainties.\nEven if we are able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in clinical trials, if we fail to gain timely approval to commercialize our product candidates from FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities, we will be unable to generate the revenues we will need to build our business. These approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and even if and when they are granted, they may not cover all the indications for which we seek approval. For example, while we may develop a product candidate with the intention of addressing a large, unmet medical need, FDA may only approve the use of the drug for indications affecting a relatively small number of patients, thus greatly reducing the market size and our potential revenues. The approvals may also contain significant limitations in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use, which could further narrow the size of the market. In certain countries, even if the health regulatory authorities approve a drug, it cannot be marketed until pricing for the drug is also approved. Finally, even after approval can be obtained, we may be required to recall or withdraw a product as a result of newly discovered safety or efficacy concerns, either of which would have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn order to fund future operations, we will need to raise significant amounts of additional capital. Because it can be difficult for a small-cap company like ours to raise equity capital on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary capital when we need it, or on acceptable terms, if at all.\nEven if our technologies and product candidates are superior, if we lack the capital needed to bring our future products to market, we will never be successful. We have obtained the capital necessary to fund our research and development programs to date primarily from the following sources:\n\u2022\nUpfront payments, milestone payments, and payments for limited amounts of our antibodies received from licensing partners;\n\u2022\nProceeds from the public and private sale of our equity or debt securities; and\n\u2022\nLimited product sales of LeukoScan\u00ae, licenses, grants and interest income from our investments.\nOur budgeted cash requirements in fiscal year 2016 are expected to be in the range of $52.0 to $54.0 million, including interest costs of $4.8 million for the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes issued in February 2015. Based on our cash flow projections, we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months. Future financial demands include ongoing operating expenses, Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and further development of various clinical trial programs in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We will continue to require additional funding in order to fund our operations and programs. As of June 30, 2015, we have approximately $100.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nWe continue to pursue business development and licensing arrangements as a potential source of financing. These activities include potential payments from partners, such as The Bayer Group (\u201cBayer\u201d), as well as any new parties who may be interested in clinical programs as well as any licenses to our intellectual property estate. State and Federal Grants, along with potential debt and equity financing may also be other sources of financing.\nOver the long term, we expect research and development activities to continue to expand and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to continue to complete development of product candidates in line with our pipeline included in our long term corporate strategy. Our capital requirements are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe rate at which we progress our research programs and the number of product candidates we have in pre-clinical and clinical development at any one time;\n\u2022\nThe cost of conducting clinical trials involving patients in the U.S., Europe and possibly elsewhere;\n\u2022\nOur need to establish the manufacturing capabilities necessary to produce the quantities of our product candidates we project we will need;\n\u2022\nThe time and costs involved in obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nThe cost of first obtaining, and then defending, our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nThe ability and willingness of the holders of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 to convert their Notes to Immunomedics common stock; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into licensing and other collaborative agreements to help offset some of these costs.\nThere may be additional cash requirements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in our research and development plans, the need for unexpected capital expenditures or costs associated with any acquisitions of other businesses, assets or technologies that we may choose to undertake. If we deplete our existing capital resources, we will be required to either obtain additional capital quickly, or else significantly reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUntil we can generate significant cash from our operations, we expect to continue to fund our operations with our available financial resources. These financial resources may not be adequate to sustain our operations and we will be required to finance future cash needs through strategic collaboration agreements, the sale of additional equity or debt securities. However, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. The capital markets have experienced volatility in recent years, which has resulted in uncertainties with respect to availability of capital and hence the timing to meet an entity\u2019s liquidity needs. Having insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate some or all of our programs or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. Additionally, if we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders would result; and if we raise funds by incurring additional debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve future cash payment obligations and/or conversion to equity as well as restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nIf we, or our collaboration partners, cannot successfully and efficiently manufacture the compounds that make up our products and product candidates, our ability, and the ability of our collaboration partners, to sell products and conduct clinical trials will be impaired.\nOur ability to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical research and development programs depends, in large part, upon our ability to manufacture our proprietary compounds in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. We have limited historical experience in manufacturing these compounds in significant quantities, and we may not be able to do so in the quantities required to commercialize these products. Any interruption in manufacturing at this site, whether by natural acts or otherwise, could significantly and adversely affect our operations, and delay our research and development programs.\nWe and our collaboration partners also depend on third parties to provide certain raw materials, manufacturing and processing services. All manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (\u201ccGMPs\u201d), required by FDA and other regulatory agencies. Such regulations address, among other matters, controls in manufacturing processes, quality control and quality assurance requirements and the maintenance of proper records and documentation. FDA and other regulatory agencies routinely inspect manufacturing facilities. FDA generally will issue a notice on Form 483 if it finds issues with respect to its inspections. If our manufacturing facility or those facilities of our partners and our respective contract manufacturers or processors do not comply with applicable cGMPs and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to product liability claims, we may be unable to meet clinical demand for our products, and we could suffer delays in the progress of clinical trials for products under development.\nWe are dependent upon UCB for the final development and commercialization of epratuzumab for the treatment of all autoimmune disease indications worldwide, and they may not be successful.\nWe have licensed the exclusive worldwide rights for the treatment of all autoimmune disease indications to one of our most advanced therapeutic compounds, epratuzumab to UCB. As a result, UCB is solely responsible, and we are depending upon them, for completing the clinical development of this compound, obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, and then commercializing and manufacturing the compounds for sale. On July 28, 2015, UCB announced that the two Phase 3 EMBODY\u2122 clinical trials for epratuzumab in SLE did not meet the primary clinical efficacy endpoints in either dose in both studies. As a result, their ability to commercialize this product candidate in the future, as well as our ability to commercialize other product candidates we have in development which are closely related to them, could be severely jeopardized. In such event, it is likely we could never receive any additional milestone payments or royalties that we are eligible to receive under our agreement with UCB, and our ability to fund the development and testing of our other product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully establish and maintain collaborative and licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our future collaboration partners may not adequately perform their responsibilities under our agreement, which could adversely affect our development and commercialization program.\nA key element of our business strategy is to develop, market and commercialize our product candidates through collaborations with more established pharmaceutical companies. We may not be able to maintain or expand these licenses and collaborations or establish additional licensing and collaboration arrangements necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we are able to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product candidates. Any failure to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements on favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe expect to rely at least in part on third party collaborators to perform a number of activities relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including the manufacturing of product materials, the design and conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates, and potentially the obtaining of regulatory approvals and marketing and distribution of any successfully developed products. Our collaborative partners may also have or acquire rights to control aspects of our product development and clinical programs. As a result, we may not be able to conduct these programs in the manner or on the time schedule we currently contemplate. In addition, if any of these collaborative partners withdraw support for our programs or product candidates or otherwise impair their development, our business could be negatively affected. To the extent we undertake any of these activities internally, our expenses may increase.\nIn addition, our success depends on the performance of our collaborators of their responsibilities under these arrangements. Some potential collaborators may not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us. Because such agreements may be exclusive, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration agreement with any other company covering the same product field during the applicable collaborative period. In addition, our collaborators\u2019 competitors may not wish to do business with us at all due to our relationship with our collaborators. If we are unable to enter into additional product discovery and development collaborations, our ability to sustain or expand our business will be significantly diminished.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to first obtain and then adequately protect our patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as avoiding the infringement of the rights of others.\nOur future success will be highly dependent upon our ability to first obtain and then defend the patent and other intellectual property rights necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates. We have filed numerous patent applications on the technologies and processes that we use in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. Although we have obtained a number of issued U.S. patents to date, the patent applications owned or licensed by us may not result in additional patents being issued. Moreover, these patents may not afford us the protection we need against competitors with similar technologies or products. A number of jurisdictions where we have sought, or may in future choose to seek, intellectual property protection, have intellectual property laws and patent offices which are still developing. Accordingly, we may have difficulty obtaining intellectual property protection in these markets, and any intellectual property protections which we do obtain may be less protective than in the U.S., which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial prospects.\nThe successful development of therapeutic products frequently requires the application of multiple technologies that may be subject to the patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Although we believe it is likely we will need to license technologies and processes from third parties in the ordinary course of our business, we are not currently aware of any material conflict involving our technologies and processes with any valid patents or other intellectual property rights owned or licensed by others. In the event that a third party was to claim such a conflict existed, they could sue us for damages as well as seek to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. It is possible that a third party could successfully claim that our\nproducts infringe on their intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the litigation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, would require significant financial resources and management time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain these costs more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial and managerial resources. If a patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved unfavorably to us, we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products without a license from the other party, in addition to being held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn addition to our reliance on patents, we attempt to protect our proprietary technologies and processes by relying on trade secret laws, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary information. These agreements and arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies and processes or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or technology, either of which could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nExpiry of our intellectual property rights could lead to increased competition\nEven where we are able to obtain and then defend patent and other intellectual property rights necessary for research, development and commercialization of our product candidates, such intellectual property rights will be for a limited term. Where patents which we own or license expire, the technology the subject of the patent may be utilized by third parties in research and development or competing products (for example, generic versions of a patented product may be manufactured by third parties once the patent expires). While we endeavor to maintain robust intellectual property protection, as our existing issued patents expire it may materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe face substantial competition in the biotechnology industry and may not be able to compete successfully against one or more of our competitors.\nThe biotechnology industry is highly competitive, particularly in the area of diagnostic and therapeutic oncology and autoimmune disease products. In recent years, there have been extensive technological innovations achieved in short periods of time, and it is possible that future technological changes and discoveries by others could result in our products and product candidates quickly becoming uncompetitive or obsolete. A number of companies, including Biogen Idec, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Seattle Genetics, ImmunoGen, Merck Serono, Genmab, Celgene, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly, are engaged in the development of therapeutic autoimmune and oncology products. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have more established positions in the pharmaceutical industry and are therefore better equipped to develop, commercialize and market oncology and autoimmune disease products. Even some smaller competitors may obtain a significant competitive advantage over us if they are able to discover or otherwise acquire patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements or merge with larger pharmaceutical companies. Further, even if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize products, other manufacturers operating in emerging markets may also have a competitive advantage over us with respect to competing products due to their ability to manufacture with a lower cost base.\nWe expect to face increasing competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. These institutions carry out a significant amount of research and development in the field of antibody-based technologies and they are increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings. As a result, they are demanding greater patent and other proprietary rights, as well as licensing and future royalty revenues. It is\npossible that such competition could come from universities with which we have, or have previously had, collaborative research and development relationships, notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property in the course of such relationships.\nWe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use in the operations of our business.\nIn addition to laws and regulations enforced by FDA, we are also subject to regulation under various other foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our manufacturing and research and development programs involve the controlled use of viruses, hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials can never be completely eliminated, and if an accident occurs we could be held liable for any damages that result, which could exceed our available resources.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to significant liability claims, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover any future claims.\nThe use of our compounds in clinical trials and any future sale exposes us to liability claims that could be substantial. These claims might be made directly by healthcare providers, medical personnel, patients, consumers, pharmaceutical companies, and others selling or distributing our compounds. While we currently have product liability insurance that we consider adequate for our current needs, we may not be able to continue to obtain comparable insurance in the future at an acceptable cost, if at all. If for any reason we cannot maintain our existing or comparable liability insurance, our ability to clinically test and market products could be significantly impaired. Moreover, the amount and scope of our insurance coverage, as well as the indemnification arrangements with third parties upon which we rely, may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim. Any successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the talents of Dr. David M. Goldenberg, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Scientific Officer, and Chief Patent Officer, and Ms. Cynthia L. Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as certain other key personnel. If Dr. Goldenberg, Ms. Sullivan or any of our other key personnel were to unexpectedly leave our Company, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as our business grows we will need to continue to attract additional management and scientific personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and we may not be successful in our recruitment efforts. If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain qualified professionals, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain potential for conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, exist which could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation.\nCertain members of our senior management and Board of Directors have relationships and agreements, both with us as well as among themselves and their respective affiliates, which create the potential for both real, as well as perceived, conflicts of interest. These include Dr. David M. Goldenberg, our Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer, and Chief Patent Officer, Ms. Cynthia L. Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer (who is also the wife of Dr. Goldenberg), and certain companies with which we do business, including the Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology and the Garden State Cancer Center (which operates as the clinical arm of CMMI to facilitate the translation of CMMI\u2019s research efforts in the treatment of patients), collectively defined as CMMI. For example, Dr. Goldenberg is the President and a Trustee of CMMI, a not-for-profit cancer research center that we used to conduct certain research activities. CMMI is currently in the process of dissolving. Dr. Goldenberg is also a minority stockholder, director and officer of our majority-owned subsidiary, IBC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Dr. Goldenberg is the primary inventor of new intellectual property for Immunomedics and\nIBC and is largely responsible for allocating ownership between the two companies. Dr. Goldenberg also has primary responsibility for monitoring the market for incidences of potential infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties.\nAs a result of these and other relationships, the potential for both real and perceived conflicts of interest exists and disputes could arise over the allocation of funds, research projects and ownership of intellectual property rights. In addition, in the event that we become involved in stockholder litigation regarding these potential conflicts, we might be required to devote significant resources and management time defending the company from these claims, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nGiven that autoimmune and cancer therapeutics such as the ones we are developing can cost upwards of $30,000 per treatment (or more), even if our product candidates become available for sale it is likely that federal and state governments, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs will try to first limit the use of these drugs to certain patients, and may be reluctant to provide a level of reimbursement that permits us to earn a significant profit on our investment, if any.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize therapeutic products will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which hospitals and physicians can obtain appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for diagnostic and therapeutic products and related services. In addition, legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs may result in lower prices or the actual inability of prospective customers to purchase our products. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is available, it may not be available at price levels sufficient for us to realize a positive return on our investment.\nA portion of our funding has come from federal government grants and research contracts. Due to reductions in funding, we may not be able to rely on these grants or contracts as a continuing source of funds.\nDuring the last few years, we have generated revenues from awards made to us by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense to partially fund some of our programs. We cannot rely on grants or additional contracts as a continuing source of funds. Funds available under these grants and contracts must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the government rather than for all our programs generally. The government\u2019s obligation to make payments under these grants and contracts is subject to appropriation by the U.S. Congress for funding in each year. It is possible that Congress or the government agencies that administer these government research programs will continue to scale back these programs or terminate them due to their own budgetary constraints, as they have recently been doing. Additionally, these grants and research contracts are subject to adjustment based upon the results of periodic audits performed on behalf of the granting authority. Consequently, the government may not award grants or research contracts to us in the future, and any amounts that we derive from existing awards may be less than those received to date. In those circumstances, we would need to provide funding on our own, obtain other funding, or scale back or terminate the affected program. In particular, we cannot assure you that any currently-contemplated or future efforts to obtain funding for our product candidate programs through government grants or contracts will be successful, or that any such arrangements which we do conclude will supply us with sufficient funds to complete our development programs without providing additional funding on our own or obtaining other funding. Where funding is obtained from government agencies or research bodies, our intellectual property rights in the research or technology funded by the grant are typically subject to certain licenses to such agencies or bodies, which could have an impact on our utilization of such intellectual property in future.\nWe face a number of risks relating to the maintenance of our information systems and our use of information relating to clinical trials.\nIn managing our operations, we rely on computer systems and electronic communications, including systems relating to record keeping, financial information, sourcing, and back-up and the internet (\u201cInformation Systems\u201d). Our Information Systems include the electronic storage of financial, operational, research, patient and\nother data. Our Information Systems may be subject to interruption or damage from a variety of causes, including power outages, computer and communications failures, system capacity constraints, catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes and other natural disasters), cyber risks, computer viruses and security breaches. If our Information Systems cease to function properly, are damaged or are subject to unauthorized access, we may suffer interruptions in our operations, be required to make significant investments to fix or replace systems and/or be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, or government action. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our clinical trials information and patient data (which may include personally identifiable information) is part of our Information Systems and is therefore subject to all of the risks set forth above, notwithstanding our efforts to code and protect such information.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Industry\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.\nThe reforms imposed by the law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects of PPACA cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our future products, and we could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.\nOur industry and we are subject to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where our products are and product candidates may be sold.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including our biologic product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. As a result, we are subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:\n\u2022\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nOur clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; we do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;\n\u2022\nFDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates and if we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as current good clinical practice, or cGCP, requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nIf the clinical development process is completed successfully, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of therapeutics will depend on our first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022\nThere is no assurance that we will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of our product candidates for any indication; we are subject to government regulation for the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nWe have not received regulatory approval in the U.S. or any foreign jurisdiction for the commercial sale of any of our biologic product candidates;\n\u2022\nEven if one or more of our product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;\n\u2022\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities could subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\nAlthough several of our product candidates have received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and the E.U. for particular indications, we may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for any or all of those product candidates or indications upon approval, and even if we do obtain orphan drug exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition;\n\u2022\nEven if one or more of our product candidates is approved in the U.S., it may not obtain the 12 years of exclusivity from biosimilars for which innovator biologics are eligible, and even if it does obtain such exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition;\n\u2022\nFDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained; and\n\u2022\nWe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of our business.\nIn addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing\npolicies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nFederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, exclusion from governmental health care programs, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nConversion of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes (\u201cNotes\u201d) will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion and exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants.\nOur indebtedness and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.\nAs of June 30, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness was $110.3 million, including our obligations under our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes. We intend to fulfill our current debt service obligations, including repayment of the principal from our existing cash and investments, as well as the proceeds from potential licensing agreements and any additional financing from equity or debt transactions. However, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow to meet these obligations, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, or delaying or curtailing research and development programs. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ.\nIf the bid price of our common stock falls below $1.00 for an extended period, or we are unable to continue to meet NASDAQ\u2019s listing maintenance standards for any other reason, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ.\nIf our stock is delisted from NASDAQ, we will make every possible effort to have it listed on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board\u201d). If our common stock was to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related SEC rules would impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell our securities. These rules may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell our common stock and otherwise negatively affect the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock.\nIf our common stock would not be able to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, we would make every effort to have it available for trading on the National Quotation Bureau\u2019s Pink Sheets, or the Pink Sheets. The Pink Sheets market consists of security firms who act as market makers in the stocks, usually, of very small companies. The bid and asked prices are not quoted electronically, but are quoted daily in \u201chard copy\u201d which is delivered to firms that subscribe. Stocks that trade in the Pink Sheets are usually not as liquid as those that trade in electronic markets and, often time, the difference between the bid and the asked prices are substantial. As a result, if our common stock were traded on the Pink Sheets, there would likely be a further negative affect on the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock even compared to what we might suffer if we were traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.\nAs a result of the above, we cannot assure you that our common stock will be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets; or if it is to be listed, whether or not there would be an interruption in the trading of our common stock. We believe that the listing of our stock on a recognized national trading market, such as NASDAQ, is an important part of our business and strategy. Such a listing helps our stockholders by providing a readily available trading market with current quotations. Without that, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock would likely decline. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded it by other parties. In that regard, listing on a recognized national trading market will also affect our ability to benefit from the use of its operations and expansion plans, including for use in licensing agreements, joint ventures, the development of strategic relationships and acquisitions, which are critical to our business and strategy and none of which is currently the subject of any agreement, arrangement or understanding, with respect to any future financing or strategic relationship it may undertake. The delisting from NASDAQ would result in negative publicity and would negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\nIf we were delisted from NASDAQ, we may become subject to the trading complications experienced by \u201cPenny Stocks\u201d in the over-the-counter market.\nDelisting from NASDAQ may depress the price of our common stock such that we may become a penny stock. The SEC generally defines a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. We continue to be listed on NASDAQ. \u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules require, among other things, that any broker engaging in a purchase or sale of our securities provide its customers with: (i) a risk disclosure document; (ii) disclosure of market quotations, if any; (iii) disclosure of the compensation of the broker and its salespersons in the transaction; and (iv) monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customers\u2019 accounts.\nA broker would be required to provide the bid and offer quotations and compensation information before effecting the transaction. This information must be contained on the customers\u2019 confirmation. Generally, brokers are less willing to effect transactions in penny stocks due to these additional delivery requirements. These requirements may make it more difficult for stockholders to purchase or sell our common stock. Because the broker, not us, prepares this information, we would not be able to assure that such information is accurate, complete or current.\nWe may add lease lines to finance capital expenditures and may obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit. If we issue other debt securities in the future, our debt service obligations will increase further.\nOur indebtedness could have significant additional negative consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our existing cash and marketable securities balances and, if available, future cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nWe may not have the ability to raise funds necessary to purchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes.\nFollowing a fundamental change as described in the indenture, holders of Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase their Notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or require prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our other than existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for purchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions in the agreements governing our then-outstanding indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Notes, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities.\nSales of our common stock (including the issuance of shares upon conversion of convertible debt) in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of shares. We have outstanding $100 million principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes that convert to common stock at prices equivalent to $5.11 (subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events). Our obligation to convert the 4.75% Notes upon demand by the holders may depress the price of our common stock and also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of June 30, 2015 we had 94,511,853 shares of common stock outstanding, plus (1) $100 million of principal amount of 4.75% Notes convertible into up to approximately 19,583,360 shares of common stock at the conversion rate of $5.11 subject to adjustment as described in the indenture, (2) 4,525,340 options to purchase shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $3.48 per share, (3) 706,881 restricted stock units to purchase shares of common stock as they are vested, (4) 12,119,108 options to purchase shares of common stock under the Plan and (5) warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $8.00. Effective July 1, 2015 with the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Dr. Goldenberg, an additional 1,500,000 of restricted stock units were issued to Dr. Goldenberg. All of the remaining 21,053,458 shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction.\nOur outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, options and warrants may adversely affect our ability to consummate future equity-based financings due to the dilution potential to future investors.\nDue to the number of shares of common stock we are obligated to issue pursuant to outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, options and warrants, potential investors may not purchase our future equity offerings at market price because of the potential dilution such investors may suffer as a result of the exercise of the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, options and warrants.\nOur outstanding 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes may adversely affect our ability to consummate future equity-based financings due to the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture pursuant to which the 4.75% Notes were issued.\nHolders of our 4.75% Notes have certain rights that may inhibit our ability to raise additional capital. Those rights include (a) full-ratchet anti-dilution protection in the event we sell securities at a price lower than the applicable conversion or exercise price of the 4.75% Notes and (b) the right to pro rata participation in any future financing.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past, and is likely to continue to fluctuate widely based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. Furthermore, the stock market and the market for stocks of relatively small biopharmaceutical companies like ours have from time to time experienced, and likely will again experience, significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to actual operating performance.\nFrom time to time, stock market analysts publish research reports or otherwise comment upon our business and future prospects. Due to a number of factors, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors and our stock price would likely decline as a result. These factors include:\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us, our current collaboration partners, any future alliance partners or our competitors of pre-clinical studies and clinical trial results, regulatory developments, technological innovations or new therapeutic products, product sales, new products or product candidates and product development timelines;\n\u2022\nThe formation or termination of corporate alliances;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or our respective competitors, including litigation;\n\u2022\nDevelopments or disputes concerning our patent or other proprietary rights, and the issuance of patents in our field of business to others;\n\u2022\nGovernment regulatory action;\n\u2022\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in the results of our operations; and\n\u2022\nDevelopments and market conditions for emerging growth companies and biopharmaceutical companies, in general.\nIn addition, Internet \u201cchat rooms\u201d have provided forums where investors make predictions about our business and prospects, oftentimes without any real basis in fact, that readers may trade on.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market prices of the securities of companies in our industry, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against those companies. Please see Item 3 (\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) for a description of such litigation. If we face such litigation in the future, it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur principal stockholder can significantly influence all matters requiring the approval by our stockholders.\nAs of June 30, 2015, Dr. David M. Goldenberg, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Patent Officer, together with certain members of his family, including Ms. Cynthia L. Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is Dr. Goldenberg\u2019s wife, and other affiliates, controlled the right to vote approximately 8% of our outstanding common stock and 7% of our fully diluted common stock. As a result of this voting power, Dr. Goldenberg has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of substantially all matters that may be put to a vote of our stockholders, including the election of our directors.\nThere are limitations on the liability of our directors, and we may have to indemnify our officers and directors in certain instances.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits, to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law, the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers and directors and may indemnify our employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. These provisions may be in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions under Delaware law. The indemnification provisions may require us, among other things, to indemnify such officers and directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers (other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature), to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified and to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent made or threatened to be made a party to an action by reason of the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or was serving at the request of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Delaware law does not permit a corporation to eliminate a director\u2019s duty of care and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation have no effect on the availability of equitable remedies, such as injunction or rescission, for a director\u2019s breach of the duty of care.\nWe believe that our limitation of officer and director liability assists us to attract and retain qualified employees and directors. However, in the event an officer, a director or the board of directors commits an act that may legally be indemnified under Delaware law, we will be responsible to pay for such officer(s) or director(s) legal defense and potentially any damages resulting there from. Furthermore, the limitation on director liability\nmay reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders from instituting litigation against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders and us. Given the difficult environment and potential for incurring liabilities currently facing directors of publicly-held corporations, we believe that director indemnification is in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests because it enhances our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and reduce a possible deterrent to entrepreneurial decision-making.\nNevertheless, limitations of director liability may be viewed as limiting the rights of stockholders, and the broad scope of the indemnification provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could result in increased expenses. Our board of directors believes, however, that these provisions will provide a better balancing of the legal obligations of, and protections for, directors and will contribute positively to the quality and stability of our corporate governance. Our board of directors has concluded that the benefit to stockholders of improved corporate governance outweighs any possible adverse effects on stockholders of reducing the exposure of directors to liability and broadened indemnification rights.\nWe are exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d). Compliance with Section 404 requires substantial accounting expense and significant management efforts. Our testing, or the subsequent review by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls that would require us to remediate in a timely manner so as to be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 each year. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NASDAQ GMS or other regulatory authorities that would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. Until such time as we pay cash dividends our stockholders, must rely on increases in our stock price for appreciation.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain future earnings to develop and commercialize our product candidates and therefore we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Until such time as we determine to pay cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders must rely on increases in the market price of our common stock for appreciation.", "PERMNO": 43757, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "IMMU"}
