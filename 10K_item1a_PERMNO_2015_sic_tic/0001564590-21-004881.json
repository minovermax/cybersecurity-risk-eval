Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption and has negatively affected the business and results of operations for the Company. We have taken steps to align our business with the unfavorable economic conditions, including headcount reductions, reductions in employee hours, and/or furloughs, at many of our sites. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and there is no guarantee our efforts to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19 will be effective.\nWe have experienced lower demand and operational interruptions as a result of COVID-19, including the temporary suspension of operations due to the inability to staff facilities or government-imposed restrictions, which has had an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of such manufacturing facilities, and in turn an adverse effect on our business and operations. While most of our manufacturing sites are currently in operation, we have reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures, employee welfare concerns and the impact of COVID-19 on the global demand and supply chain. Our manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from COVID-19 including, among other things, additional government actions and other responsive measures, further decreases in demand and/or deeper supply chain disruptions, and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. To comply with local regulations and ensure workplace safety, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures and protocols for the use of personal protective equipment have been instituted, as well as work cell zoning to ensure social distancing, for those sites that remain operational.\nWe are heavily dependent on sales to customers in the aerospace industry, which has been materially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 55% of our sales for fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from sales to Commercial Aerospace customers, which included 84% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft, and 16% from regional and business aircraft. Current travel restrictions, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft, which has had an adverse impact our sales and operating results and may continue to do so for an extended period of time. While we are unable to predict the magnitude and duration of such and impact at this time, the further loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing will materially impair our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in market volatility, which has caused a significant decline in our stock price, subjecting us to increased takeover risk, impaired our ability to declare dividends or other distributions and conduct share buybacks, and may impact our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and raise additional funds when and as needed. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by business disruptions, performance delays or interruptions, payment defaults or bankruptcy of our third-party customers and suppliers, which could lead to additional charges, impairments, and other adverse financial impacts.\nWe cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, results, and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are not known at this time, as the situation is unprecedented and continues to evolve. These include, among others, the extent of harm to public health, including the duration of the pandemic, any potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, some of which may be more transmissible or virulent than the initial strain, and the availability and distribution of effective vaccines and medical treatments, further disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our products, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and adjust our production schedules to align with changing demand, potential future restructuring actions, impairments and other charges, the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital, the costs incurred to keep our employees safe while maintaining continued operations, and our ability to effectively motivate and retain the necessary workforce. We are staying in close communication with our manufacturing facilities, employees, customers, and suppliers, and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation through cost-savings and other measures, which may not be successful and are subject to the factors described above, many of which are uncertain or outside of our control. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including the current recession and the impact on air travel.\nIn addition to the foregoing, many of the risk factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nThe markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific or macroeconomic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the event of an economic downturn, including the current recession, we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results, as occurred during 2020 with respect to the aerospace industry.\nAt December 31, 2020, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of 12,181 aircraft, which represents multiple years of production. To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations, or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, including as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would reduce sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income. Approximately 55% of our sales for 2020 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 84% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 16% from regional and business aircraft. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, suspension or discontinuation of current programs, such as the suspension of production of the Boeing 737 MAX in 2020, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response or a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. During 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry, we experienced a material decrease in demand resulting in order cancellations and deferrals from our Commercial Aerospace customers, which resulted in decreased sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and reduced operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020. To the extent significant reductions in demand continue to occur it would have further negative impact on our sales.\nOur content on the A350 is approximately $4.8 million per plane and it is our largest program. Both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs, including the A380, B787, B747-8, A400M, A350 and B777X. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth, or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays, or production cuts arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, future pandemics or other macro-economic factors in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.\nIn addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, hedging and other actions.\nA significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition.\nWe have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and the Space & Defense markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 84%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 20%, of our 2020 sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximately 33% and 39% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 19% and 25% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. Significant changes in the demand for our customers\u2019 end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors, including the recent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators, which resulted in a suspension of production in January 2020, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel and general economic conditions. Further delays in the production ramp-up of the Boeing 737 MAX, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nReductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our sales.\nSpace and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 30% of our sales in 2020 were to the Space & Defense market of which approximately 77% were related to\nmilitary programs in the United States and other countries. In addition to normal business risks, our indirect supply of products to the U.S. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. Department of Defense budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the new Biden Administration or otherwise, the U.S. government\u2019s budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., allocating more spending to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic), the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce military spending, each of which could cause the Department of Defense budget to remain unchanged or to decline.\nIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nIf we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed current industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks.\nOver the past several years, we have completed strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies. We expect to continue to explore complementary mergers, acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue divestures of business lines or investments that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to source appropriate acquisition targets at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of trained personnel or work stoppages.\nOur business has historically been dependent on a highly trained workforce because of the complex nature of our products. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of employees in the United States and the majority of those in Europe were represented by collective bargaining agreements. Since April 2020, we have furloughed or eliminated a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our customer demand. If the demand for trained personnel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels, and we are unable to quickly reassemble our workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of trained personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have engaged in restructuring and alignment activities from time to time and there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the intended effects.\nFrom time to time, we have responded to changes in our industry and the markets we serve, or other changes in our business, by restructuring or aligning our operations. In 2020, in an effort to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took certain actions to align our costs with decreased sales and to preserve liquidity, including eliminating approximately 35% of our global headcount costs, curtailing discretionary spending, and suspending dividend payments and stock repurchases. In November 2020, we closed our wind energy prepreg production facility in Windsor, Colorado to align with decreased production demand. Due to necessary cost reduction measures or changes in the industry and markets in which we compete, we may decide to implement\nrestructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot provide any assurance that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others: (a) higher than expected severance costs related to headcount reductions; (b) higher than expected costs of closing plants; (c) incurring costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed; and (d) delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan. If we are unable to align our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability.\nOur profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aluminum foil and aramid paper. Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, hedging or by-passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful.\nThe occurrence of material operational problems or interruptions, including but not limited to, a result of the failure of key equipment, the effects of natural disasters, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inability to install, staff and/or qualify necessary capacity, the failure to achieve planned manufacturing improvements, or any other inability to meet customer specifications, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, and could have a material effect on the Company as a whole.\nWe have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.\nWe believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2020, 47% of our production and 53% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic, political, legal, social and health conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy, such as the impact of a public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on employees and the global economy; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States; (d) cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) loss of sales to international customers, including those located in China and Russia, as a result of more stringent trade control laws in the United States; (f) tax rates may vary and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; (g) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, resulting from the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and (h) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. In addition, a significant portion of the 53% of our customer sales that occurred outside of the United States in 2020 occurred in the U.K. and the European Union. We have production facilities within the U.K. that supply customers in the European Union and customers within the U.K. that are supplied by most of the production facilities in the European Union, and any future tariffs or other disruptions to these trade flows related to the exit of the U.K. from the European Union could negatively impact our business. Although the U.K. and the European Union reached a trade agreement, removing a degree of uncertainty and financial risk, the details and overall impact on our U.K. business and other business is still being assessed. The new trading relationship between the U.K. and European Union will likely result in increased costs of goods imported and exported between the U.K. and European Union, together with potential delays arising from the increase of formalities. There will also likely be additional costs arising between the U.K. and other countries where there is no current trade agreement in place. Our ability to increase pricing of our products in light of increased costs is uncertain and, to the extent we are unable to fully do so, our profitability will decline. Other potential adverse consequences of the exit of the U.K. from the European Union include global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, most of our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements.\nOur operations require the handling, use, storage, transport and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health, and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.\nWe have been named as a \u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d under Superfund or similar state laws at our former and current sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire cleanup obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which presents both risks and opportunities for our businesses as legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions increase. Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gases that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment, increase our expenditures or limit our ability to grow. In addition, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment, which could limit our ability to grow and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions.\nWe depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. From time to time, we experience cyberattacks on our information technology systems, and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system have become more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, and stealing, corrupting, or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. While Company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, future cybersecurity attacks could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption or loss of data and exposure of proprietary and confidential information, disruptions in critical\nsystems and theft of data, funds, or intellectual property. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any intrusion may also cause operational stoppages or result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to comply with our customers\u2019, including the U.S. government\u2019s, increased cybersecurity protections and standards.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, although the Company will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe short-term rights agreement that we entered into in 2020 could discourage third parties from seeking strategic transactions with us that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOn April 6, 2020, our board of directors declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of the Company\u2019s common stock and adopted a stockholder rights plan, as set forth in the rights agreement. The stockholder rights plan was adopted in response to the extraordinary business and market dislocations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain it, as well as the termination of the Company\u2019s previously announced merger of equals with Woodward, Inc. The stockholder rights plan was not adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the Company. In general, the rights agreement works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of the board of directors. The rights agreement is intended to deter any person or group from triggering the rights without such acquisition first being approved by the board of directors. If triggered by an acquiring person, the provisions of the rights agreement, among other things, will substantially dilute the equity and voting interests of any potential acquiring person unless the board of directors approves the acquisition, and may have the effect of delaying, discouraging, or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The rights agreement will expire on April 6, 2021.", "PERMNO": 61567, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "HXL"}
