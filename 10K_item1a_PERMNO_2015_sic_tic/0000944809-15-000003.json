RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have a history of operating losses and we do not expect to become profitable in the near future.\nWe are a healthcare company with a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from the sale of proprietary pharmaceutical products or certain of our diagnostic products for some time and we have generated only limited revenue from our pharmaceutical operations in Chile, Mexico, Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, from our ophthalmic instrumentation business, which we sold in October 2011, and from sale of the 4Kscore. Although we launched sales of 4Kscore in 2014, and we plan to launch certain other diagnostics products in the near future, we may not generate substantial revenue from the sale of these products for some time or at all. We have not yet submitted any pharmaceutical products for marketing approval or clearance by regulatory authorities and we do not currently have rights to any pharmaceutical product candidates that have been approved for marketing, other than those products sold by our Chilean, Mexican, Israeli, Spanish, and Uruguayan subsidiaries. We continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations and, to date, we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our pre-clinical development activities and clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur losses from our operations for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research activities and conduct development of, and seek regulatory approvals and clearances for, our product candidates, and prepare for and begin to commercialize any approved or cleared products. If our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval or clearance, or if our product candidates do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. In addition, if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), to perform studies in addition to those we currently anticipate, our expenses will increase beyond current expectations and the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nWe may require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are advancing and intend to continue to advance multiple product candidates through clinical and pre-clinical development. As of December 31, 2014, we have cash and cash equivalents of $96.9 million. In January 2015, we completed our exclusive worldwide agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP. Under the terms of the agreements with Pfizer, we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, the royalties will transition to a regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizer\u2019s Genotropin\u00ae. We are responsible for development expense under the agreement up to an agreed cap which may be exceeded in certain circumstances.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand or available to us through lines of credit to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or subject to change, and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or curtail aspects of our operations in order to preserve our capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the success of our relationship with Pfizer, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the continued progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or strategic collaborations. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets. Economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. Continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and financial condition. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nThe conversion and redemption features of our 2033 Senior Notes are classified as embedded derivatives and may continue to result in volatility in our financial statements, including having a material impact on our results of operations and the derivative liability recorded.\nThe conversion rights and redemption options of our 2033 Senior Notes are classified as embedded derivatives and as a result, are marked-to-market to reflect their fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is influenced by a variety of factors, including the actual and anticipated behavior of the holders of the 2033 Senior Notes, the expected volatility of our Common Stock price and our Common Stock price as of the fair value measurement date. Some of these factors are outside of our control. As a result, changes in these factors may have a material impact on our results of operations and the derivative liability recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consequently, our financial statements may vary periodically, based on factors other than our revenues and expenses.\nOur technologies are in an early stage of development and are unproven.\nThe effectiveness of our technologies is not well-known in, or accepted generally by, the clinical medical community. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully employ our technologies as therapeutic, diagnostic, or preventative solutions for any disease or condition. Our failure to establish the efficacy or safety of our technologies would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we have a limited operating history. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology, and undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our pharmaceutical product or diagnostic candidates other than those products sold by our Chilean, Mexican, Israeli, Spanish, and Uruguayan subsidiaries. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nOur research and development activities may not result in commercially viable products.\nMany of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug, diagnostic, and medical device product development. These risks further include the possibility that such products would:\n\u2022\nbe found to be ineffective, unreliable, or otherwise inadequate or otherwise fail to receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nbe difficult or impossible to manufacture on a commercial scale;\n\u2022\nbe uneconomical to market or otherwise not be effectively marketed;\n\u2022\nfail to be successfully commercialized if adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations for the costs of these products is unavailable;\n\u2022\nbe impossible to commercialize because they infringe on the proprietary rights of others or compete with products marketed by others that are superior; or\n\u2022\nfail to be commercialized prior to the successful marketing of similar products by competitors.\nThe results of pre-clinical trials and previous clinical trials for our products may not be predictive of future results, and our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nPositive results from pre-clinical studies and early clinical trial experience should not be relied upon as evidence that later-stage or large-scale clinical trials will succeed. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the results of studies conducted by collaborators or other third parties will be viewed favorably or are indicative of our own future study results. We may be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are either (i) with respect to drugs or Class III devices, safe and effective for use in a diverse population of their intended uses or (ii) with respect to Class I or Class II devices, are substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to devices that are already marketed under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that future clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through initial clinical trials.\nFurther, our drug candidates may not be approved or cleared even if they achieve their primary endpoints in phase 3 clinical trials or registration trials. In addition our diagnostic test candidates may not be approved or cleared, as the case may be, even though clinical or other data are, in our view, adequate to support an approval or clearance. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies and\nclinical trials. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval or clearance of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comment on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities\u2019 approval. Any of these regulatory authorities may also approve or clear a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications or uses than we request or may grant approval or clearance contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe results of our clinical trials may show that our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accounting Office, medical professionals, and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products, and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to develop, launch and generate revenue from our diagnostic programs.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to develop and launch diagnostic tests based on our point-of-care diagnostics platform. In addition, our business is dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize the 4Kscore. We are committing significant research and development resources to the development of diagnostic tests, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully launch these tests on anticipated timelines or at all. We have limited experience in developing, manufacturing, selling, marketing or distributing diagnostic tests. If we are not able to successfully develop, market or sell diagnostic tests we develop for any reason, including the failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals, we will not generate any revenue from the sale of such tests. Even if we are able to develop effective diagnostic tests for sale in the marketplace, a number of factors could impact our ability to sell such tests or generate any significant revenue from the sale of such tests, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain adequate infrastructure to support the commercial launch and sale of our diagnostic tests, including establishing adequate laboratory space, information technology infrastructure, sample collection and tracking systems, electronic ordering and reporting systems and other infrastructure and hiring adequate laboratory and other personnel;\n\u2022\nthe success of the validation studies for our diagnostic tests under development and our ability to publish study results in peer-reviewed journals;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative and competing tests or products and technological innovations or other advances in medicine that cause our technologies to be less competitive;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy rates of such tests, including rates of false-negatives and/or false-positives;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the safety or effectiveness or clinical utility of our diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment affecting health care and health care providers, including changes in laws regulating laboratory testing and/or device manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of our sales and marketing efforts and ability to drive adoption of our diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement levels by government payors and private insurers;\n\u2022\npricing pressures and changes in third-party payor reimbursement policies; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights held by others or others infringing our intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to successfully develop and commercialize certain of our diagnostic tests and LDTs will depend on our ability to successfully operate our CLIA-certified laboratory and maintain required regulatory licensures.\nIn December 2012, we acquired a CLIA-certified laboratory through our acquisition of OPKO Lab. In order to successfully develop and commercialize certain diagnostic tests and LDTs, we must maintain our CLIA-certified laboratory and comply with all the CLIA requirements.\nCLIA is designed to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Laboratories must undergo on-site surveys at least every two years, which may be conducted by the Federal CLIA program or by a private CMS approved accrediting agency such as CAP, among others. OPKO Lab is also subject to regulation of laboratory operations under state clinical laboratory laws as will be any new CLIA-certified laboratory that we establish or acquire. State clinical laboratory laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Certain states, such as California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require that laboratories obtain licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states and additional states may require similar licenses in the future. If we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses from states where required, we will not be able to process any samples from patients located in those states. Only Washington and New York States are exempt under CLIA, as these states have established laboratory quality standards at least as stringent as CLIA\u2019s. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with CLIA requirements, HHS or state agencies could require us to cease diagnostic testing. Even if it were possible for us to bring our laboratory back into compliance after failure to comply with such requirements, we could incur significant expenses and potentially lose revenues in doing so. Moreover, new interpretations of current regulations or future changes in regulations under CLIA may make it difficult or impossible for us to comply with the CLIA classification, which would significantly harm our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIt is also possible that we do not currently have adequate infrastructure in place for the demand of future LDTs or other diagnostic tests we develop. Failure to expand our current infrastructure and laboratories to support the development and commercialization of certain diagnostic tests could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our future product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. Numerous companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products competitive with those that we intend to commercialize ourselves and through our partners. Competitors to our diagnostics business are many and include major diagnostic companies, reference laboratories, molecular diagnostic firms, universities and research institutions. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than ours. Large pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for drugs, diagnostic tests, or medical devices. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, development resources, including personnel and technology, clinical trial experience, regulatory experience, expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights, manufacturing and distribution experience, and sales and marketing experience.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and enroll patients for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe speed at which we develop our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory approvals or clearances;\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval or clearance;\n\u2022\nappropriate coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;\n\u2022\nour ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to have our partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved products to the market; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of future product candidates by physicians and other health care providers.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, easier to use or less expensive than our future product candidates, if any, or that reach the market sooner than our future product candidates, if any, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the biopharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device industries are characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete or less competitive.\nOur product development activities could be delayed or stopped.\nWe do not know whether our current or planned pre-clinical and clinical studies will be completed on schedule, or at all. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that our planned pre-clinical and clinical studies will begin on time or at all. The commencement of our planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\na limited number of, and competition for, suitable patients with the particular types of disease required for enrollment in our clinical trials or that otherwise meet the protocol\u2019s inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria;\n\u2022\na limited number of, and competition for, suitable serum or other samples from patients with particular types of disease required for our validation studies;\n\u2022\na limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities\u2019 approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of the product candidate for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrequirements to provide the drugs, diagnostic tests, or medical devices required in our clinical trial protocols or clinical trials at no cost or cost, which may require significant expenditures that we are unable or unwilling to make;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or investigators; and\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval to conduct or renew a clinical trial at a prospective site.\nThe completion of our clinical trials could also be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy evidenced during clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntermination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols; and\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB for any given site, or us. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing, or successful completion of a clinical\ntrial. Any failure or significant delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our collaboration partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, and distribution of drug products, diagnostic products, or medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. In general, we are not permitted to market our product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval of a NDA, a clearance letter under the premarket notification process, or 510(k) process, or an approval of a PMA from the FDA. We have not submitted a NDA or PMA application or premarket notification, nor have we received marketing approval or clearance for any of our proprietary pharmaceutical or diagnostic product candidates, other than a CE Mark for our point-of-care PSA test. Obtaining approval of a NDA or PMA can be a lengthy, expensive, and uncertain process. With respect to medical devices, while the FDA reviews and clears a premarket notification in as little as three months, there is no guarantee that our products will qualify for this more expeditious regulatory process, which is reserved for Class I and II devices, nor is there any assurance that even if a device is reviewed under the 510(k) process that the FDA will review it expeditiously or determine that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-PMA device. If the FDA fails to make this finding, then we cannot market the device. In lieu of acting on a premarket notification, the FDA may seek additional information or additional data which would further delay our ability to market the product. Furthermore, we are not permitted to make changes to a device approved through the PMA or 510(k) which affects the safety or efficacy of the device without first submitting a supplement application to the PMA and obtaining FDA approval or cleared premarket notification for that supplement. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or other applicable U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval or clearance, if any, subject our company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nadverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, or non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or clearances;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures, detentions, or import bans;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve or clear pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, applications or pre-market notifications.\nRegulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement, PMA, PMA supplement or clearance pursuant to a pre-market notification is not guaranteed, and the approval or clearance process, as the case may be, is expensive and may, especially in the case of an NDA or PMA application, take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the drug and medical device approval and clearance process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The number of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval or clearance varies depending on the drug or medical device candidate, the disease or condition that the drug or medical device candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug or medical device candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval or clearance of a drug or medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\na medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-PMA device, in the case of a premarket notification;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not approve our or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval or clearance policies or adopt new regulations.\nBeyond these risks, there is also a possibility that our licensees or collaborators could decide to discontinue a study at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons.\nRegulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries may be a significant factor in how we develop, test, produce and market our diagnostic test products. Diagnostic tests like ours may not fall squarely within the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical or device products as described above, and the regulatory pathway is not as clear. It is possible that the diagnostic products developed by us or our collaborators will be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and require either PMA or 510(k) clearance from the FDA prior to marketing. Some companies that have successfully commercialized diagnostic tests for various conditions and disease states have not sought clearance or approval for such tests through the traditional 510(k) or PMA processes, and have instead utilized a process involving LDTs through a CLIA- certified laboratory. CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for diagnostic, preventative or treatment purpose. In such instances, the CLIA lab is solely responsible for the development, validation and commercialization of the assay.\nSuch LDT testing is currently under the purview of CMS and state agencies that provide oversight of the safe and effective use of LDTs. However, the FDA has consistently asserted that it has the regulatory authority to regulate LDTs despite historically exercising enforcement discretion. In furtherance of that position, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents in October 2014: (1) Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (the \u201cFramework Guidance\u201d); and (2) FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (the \u201cNotification Guidance\u201d). The Framework Guidance outlines the FDA\u2019s plan to adopt over time a risk-based approach to regulating LDTs whereby different classifications of LDTs would be subject to different levels of FDA oversight and enforcement, including, for example, prohibitions on adulteration and misbranding, establishment registration and device listing, premarket notification, banned devices, records and reports, good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, premarket review of safety, effectiveness, and clinical validity, and quality system requirements. The Notification Guidance is intended to explain how clinical laboratories should notify the FDA of the LDTs they develop and how to satisfy Medical Device Reporting requirements. If finalized, the Framework Guidance and the Notification Guidance may have a materially adverse affect on the time, cost, and risk associated with the Company's development and commercialization of LDTs for the U.S. market, and there can be no assurance that clearances or approvals sought by the Company will be granted and maintained. However, the FDA\u2019s authority to regulate LDTs continues to be challenged, and the timeline and process for finalizing the draft guidance documents is unknown. We will continue to monitor changes to all domestic and international LDT regulatory policy so as to ensure compliance with the current regulatory scheme.\nOur product candidates may have undesirable side effects and cause our approved products to be taken off the market.\nIf a product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and require us to take our approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may have limitations on how we promote our products;\n\u2022\nsales of products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a subject was to be challenged, it may negatively impact our product development efforts.\nWe take steps to ensure that all clinical data and genetic and other biological samples are collected from subjects who provide informed consent for the data and samples and we work to ensure that the subjects from whom our data and samples\nare collected do not retain any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or samples or any discoveries derived from them. However, because we may collect data and samples from countries that are governed by a number of different regulatory regimes, there are many complex legal questions relating to the adequacy of informed consent that we must continually address. The adequacy of any given subject\u2019s informed consent may be challenged in the future, and any given informed consent may prove unlawful or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our clinical collaborators, could obligate us to stop using some of our clinical samples, which in turn may hinder our product development efforts. Such a result would also likely involve legal challenges that may consume our management and financial resources.\nOur business will be heavily dependent on the success of phase 3 clinical trials for hGH-CTP and Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets) and our ability to achieve regulatory approvals for the marketing of these products and Rayaldee.\nThere is no assurance that phase 3 trials for hGH-CTP or Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets) will continue to be successful or support marketing approval, or that we will be able to obtain marketing approval for either product, Rayaldee or any other product candidate we are developing. Before they can be marketed, our products in development must be approved by the FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies. The process for obtaining FDA approval is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Although hGH-CTP and Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets) have exhibited no serious adverse events associated with the drug administration in the clinical trials conducted to date, further testing or patient use may undermine those determinations or unexpected side effects may arise. A failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these products may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. It also is possible to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials. If phase 3 clinical trials for hGH-CTP and Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets) are not successful or we are unable to achieve regulatory approval for these products or Rayaldee, our business will be significantly adversely impacted, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited sales and marketing experience for pharmaceutical products.\nWe do not have significant experience in undertaking the commercial launch of pharmaceutical products and, to date, have limited sales and marketing infrastructure and expertise. Substantial resources will continue to be required for us to promote the sale of any pharmaceutical product for which we may receive marketing clearance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to devote the necessary resources to our products under development sufficient to achieve market acceptance. Our failure to acquire or develop the skills and personnel necessary to successfully commercialize our products under development would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to address quality control issues in a timely manner could delay the production and sale of our products.\nWe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers, and we plan to meet this commitment by working diligently to continue implementing updated and improved quality systems and concepts throughout our organization. We cannot assure you that we will not have quality control issues in the future, which may result in warning letters and citations from the FDA. If we receive any warning letters from the FDA in the future, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve such quality issues to our satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the FDA. If our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us including, but not limited to, assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us, which could result in further regulatory constraints, including the governance of our quality system by a third party. Our inability to resolve these issues or the taking of further regulatory action by the FDA may weaken our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manufacture pharmaceutical products in Mexico, Spain, and Israel. We also prepare necessary test reagents and assemble and package the cassettes for our point-of-care diagnostic system at our facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. Any quality control issues at our facilities may weaken our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by\nthe FDA. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Further, some emerging markets rely on the FDA\u2019s Certificate for Foreign Government (\u201cCFG\u201d) in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements. Our failure, or our manufacturers\u2019 failure to meet QSR ISO, or any other regulatory requirements or industry standards could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition.\nEven if we obtain marketing approvals or clearances for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our product candidates, which could materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted to market a product, the approved or cleared product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Any approved or cleared product may only be promoted for its indicated uses. In addition, if the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates for marketing, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and the manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations or the FDA\u2019s QSR regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Moreover, device manufacturers are required to report adverse events by filing Medical Device Reports with the FDA, which reports are publicly available. Further, regulatory agencies must approve manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. Furthermore, any limitation on indicated uses for a product candidate or our ability to manufacture and promote a product candidate could significantly and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change their policies and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay marketing approval or clearance of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we would likely not be permitted to market our future product candidates and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval or clearance to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our products.\nEven if our product candidates obtain marketing approval or clearance, our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and/or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy of our product compared to other products;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nstrength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nprice of our products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s regulatory authority-approved labeling; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following applicable regulatory authority approval.\nIn addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and health care payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our products do not gain market acceptance, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf our future product candidates are not covered and eligible for reimbursement from government and third party payors, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved or cleared drugs and diagnostic tests is uncertain, and failure of our pharmaceutical products or diagnostic tests to be adequately covered by insurance and eligible for adequate reimbursement could limit our ability to market any future product candidates we may develop and decrease our ability to generate revenue from any of our existing and future product candidates that may be approved or cleared.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved or cleared drugs and diagnostic products. The commercial success of our existing and future product candidates in both domestic and international markets will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and other third-party payors. The government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and diagnostic tests and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. These payors may conclude that our product candidates are less safe, less effective, or less cost-effective than existing or later-introduced products. These payors may also conclude that the overall cost of the procedure using one of our devices exceeds the overall cost of the competing procedure using another type of device, and third-party payors may not approve our product candidates for insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement. The failure to obtain coverage and adequate or any reimbursement for our product candidates, or health care cost containment initiatives that limit or restrict reimbursement for our product candidates, may reduce any future product revenue. Even though a drug (not administered by a physician) may be approved by the FDA, this does not mean that a Prescription Drug Plan (\u201cPDP\u201d), a private insurer operating under Medicare Part D, will list that drug on its formulary or will set a reimbursement level. PDPs are not required to make every FDA-approved drug available on their formularies. If our drug products are not listed on sufficient number of PDP formularies or if the PDPs\u2019 levels of reimbursement are inadequate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our failure to comply with applicable Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payor rules could result in our inability to participate in a governmental payor program, our returning funds already paid to us, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or limitations on the operational function of our laboratory. If we were unable to receive reimbursement under a governmental payor program, a substantial portion of our revenues would be lost, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success is dependent to a significant degree upon the involvement and efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phillip Frost, M.D.\nOur success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phillip Frost, M.D., who is essential to our business. The departure of our CEO for whatever reason or the inability of our CEO to continue to serve in his present capacity could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our CEO has a highly regarded reputation in the pharmaceutical and medical industry and attracts business opportunities and assists both in negotiations with acquisition targets, investment targets, and potential joint venture partners. Our CEO has also provided financing to the Company, both in terms of a credit agreement and equity investments. If we lost his services, our relationships with acquisition and investment targets, joint ventures, and investors may suffer and could cause a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, and the value of our Common Stock.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our research, development, and commercialization efforts for our product candidates. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified management and pre-clinical and clinical personnel. The loss of the services or support of any of our senior management, particularly Dr. Phillip Frost, our Chairman of the Board and CEO, could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our employees. We will need to hire additional personnel as we continue to expand our research and development activities and build a sales and marketing function.\nWe have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our research, development, and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities\nthat may limit their availability to us. In addition, these advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical device, diagnostic, and other similar businesses. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will impede significantly the achievement of our research and development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy, which will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion or at all and our business may be harmed as a result.\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in development to a company also involved in commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, research, and development we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities or contracts with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators and suppliers. Maintaining these relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; manage our clinical trials effectively; hire, train and integrate additional management, development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel; improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; implement and manage an effective marketing strategy; and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nFurthermore, we may acquire additional businesses, products or product candidates that complement or augment our existing business. Integrating any newly acquired business or product could be expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to integrate any acquired business or product successfully or operate any acquired business profitably. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively and our ability to integrate any acquired businesses. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to acquire and develop other products or product candidates at all or on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to diversify or grow our business.\nWe intend to continue to rely on acquisitions and in-licensing as the source of our products and product candidates for development and commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select, and acquire pharmaceutical and diagnostic products, drug delivery technologies, and medical device product candidates. Proposing, negotiating, and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. We compete for partnering arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, and academic research institutions. Our competitors may have stronger relationships with third parties with whom we are interested in collaborating and/or may have more established histories of developing and commercializing products. Most of our competitors also have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. As a result, our competitors may have a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with such third parties, as such partnering arrangements are often decided in an auction process in which the highest bidder wins. In addition, even if we find promising product candidates, and generate interest in a partnering or strategic arrangement to acquire such product candidates, we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nWe expect that any product candidate to which we acquire rights will require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval or clearance by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. All product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical, diagnostic test or medical device product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. Even if the product candidates are approved or cleared for marketing, we cannot be sure that they would be capable of economically feasible production or commercial success. If we fail to acquire or develop other product candidates that are capable of economically feasible production and commercial success, our business, results of operations and financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have no experience manufacturing our pharmaceutical product candidates other than at our Israeli, Mexican, and Spanish facilities, and we have no experience in manufacturing our diagnostic product candidates; we therefore rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our pharmaceutical and diagnostic product candidates.\nIf our manufacturing partners are unable to produce our products in the amounts that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the quantities we require. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future.\nOur product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Any of our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with QSR regulations for devices or cGMPs for drugs, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards relating to matters such as testing, quality control, and documentation procedures. If our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with QSR or cGMPs, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously harm our business.\nAny performance failure on the part of our contract manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval or clearance of our product candidates or commercialization of our future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. In addition, our dependence on a third party for manufacturing may adversely affect our future profit margins. Our ability to replace an existing manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer before it can begin manufacturing our product candidates. Such approval would result in additional non-clinical testing and compliance inspections. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe currently have limited marketing staff and no pharmaceutical or diagnostic sales or distribution capabilities in the U.S. other than our sales force for our laboratory business and 4Kscore product based in Nashville, Tennessee. If we are unable to develop our sales, marketing and distribution capability on our own or through collaborations with marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing our pharmaceutical or diagnostic product candidates in the U.S.\nWe currently have no pharmaceutical or diagnostic test marketing, sales or distribution capabilities in the U.S. other than the sales force for the OPKO Lab business, and through our Mexican, Spanish, Chilean, and Uruguayan subsidiaries for sales in those countries and for sales of APIs by our Israeli subsidiary. If our pharmaceutical and diagnostic product candidates are approved, we intend to establish our sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time-consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of any of our internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. With respect to our existing and future product candidates, we may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements, our product revenue and profit is likely to be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our existing and future product candidates. If we are not successful in commercializing our existing and future product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nIndependent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we engage to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials. Contract research organizations may also assist us in the collection and analysis of data. These investigators and contract research organizations will not be our employees, and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time, that they devote to products that we develop. If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of product candidates or clinical trials, or if their performance is substandard, it will delay the marketing approval or clearance and commercialization of any products that we develop. Further, the FDA requires that we comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. If our independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations fail to comply with good clinical practice, the results of our clinical trials could be called into question and the clinical development of our product candidates could be delayed. Failure of clinical investigators or contract research organizations to meet their obligations to us or comply with federal regulations and good clinical practice procedures could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties, be required to pay substantial damages or make significant changes to our operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law, the False Claims Act, and HIPAA. If we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate our laboratories and our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs. Although we believe that we are substantially compliant with all existing statutes and regulations applicable to our business, different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business.\nAs a result of political, economic, and regulatory influences, the healthcare delivery industry in the U.S. is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. The costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for laboratory testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals and employer groups. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally, in the U.S., third-party payors generally require billing codes on claims for reimbursement that describe the services provided. For laboratory services, the American Medical Association establishes most of the billing codes using a data code set called Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Each third-party payor generally develops payment amounts and coverage policies for their beneficiaries or members that ties to the CPT code established for the laboratory test and, therefore, coverage and reimbursement may differ by payor even if the same billing code is reported for claims filing purposes. For laboratory tests without a specific billing code, payors often review claims on a claim-by-claim basis and there are increased uncertainties as to coverage and eligibility for reimbursement.\nIncorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information could result in non-payment for services rendered or having to pay back amounts incorrectly billed and collected. Further, the failure to timely or correctly bill could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in CMS and other government programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nThe success of our business may be dependent on the actions of our collaborative partners.\nWe have entered into and expect in the future to enter into collaborative arrangements with established multi-national pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies, which will finance or otherwise assist in the development, manufacture and marketing of products incorporating our technology. We anticipate deriving some revenues from research and development fees, license fees, milestone payments, and royalties from collaborative partners. Our prospects, therefore, may depend to some extent upon our ability to attract and retain collaborative partners and to develop technologies and products that meet the requirements of prospective collaborative partners. In addition, our collaborative partners may have the right to abandon research projects, guide strategy regarding prosecution of relevant patent applications and terminate applicable agreements, including funding obligations, prior to or upon the expiration of the agreed-upon research terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, that collaborative partners will not terminate funding before completion of projects, that our collaborative arrangements will result in successful product commercialization, or that we will derive any revenues from such arrangements. To the extent that we are unable to develop and maintain collaborative arrangements, we would need substantial additional capital to undertake research, development, and commercialization activities on our own.\nOur exclusive worldwide agreement with Pfizer Inc. is important to our business. If we do not successfully develop hGH-CTP and/or Pfizer Inc. does not successfully commercialize hGH-CTP, our business could be adversely affected. In December 2014, we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Pfizer relating to our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults and children. Under the terms of the arrangement with Prizer, we are responsible for the development program and are obligated to pay for the development up to an agreed cap, which may be exceeded under certain circumstances. If we were required to exceed the agreed cap, it could have a material negative impact on the expected benefits to us from the Pfizer transaction and our overall financial condition. In the event that the\nparties are able to obtain regulatory approvals to market a product covered by the agreement, we will be substantially dependent on Pfizer for the successful commercialization of such product. The success of the collaboration arrangement with Pfizer is dependent in part on, among other things, the skills, experience and efforts of Pfizer\u2019s employees responsible for the project, Pfizer\u2019s commitment to the arrangement, and the financial condition of Pfizer, all of which are beyond our control. In the event that Pfizer, for any reason, including but not limited to early termination of the agreement, fails to devote sufficient resources to successfully develop and commercialize any product resulting from the collaboration arrangement, our ability to earn milestone payments or receive royalty or profit sharing payments would be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop or license under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to commercialize our product candidates. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date for which nonpublication has been requested, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we or our third-party collaborators may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability, or infringement of the third-party patent or otherwise circumvent the third-party patent.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we will rely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly during certain collaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business will be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nThe issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, unenforceable, or circumvented. Moreover, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, and medical device companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, or medical device patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, the enforceability or scope of our owned or licensed patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.\nWhile we believe that our patent rights are enforceable, we cannot assure you that any patents that have issued, that may issue, or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or valid, or will not expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our product candidates or our future products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how, and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we will seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and collaborators upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees also generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.\nHowever, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants, or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will rely heavily on licenses from third parties. Failure to comply with the provisions of these licenses could result in the loss of our rights under the license agreements.\nMany of the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio are not owned by us, but are licensed from third parties. Such license agreements give us rights for the commercial exploitation of the patents resulting from the respective patent applications, subject to certain provisions of the license agreements. Failure to comply with these provisions could result in the loss of our rights under these license agreements. Our inability to rely on these patents and patent applications, which are the basis of our technology, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe license patent rights to certain of our technology from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.\nWe have obtained licenses from, among others, INEOS Healthcare, Washington University, UT Southwestern, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, The Scripps Research Institute, Arctic Partners, and Academia Sinica, among others, that are necessary or useful for our business. In addition, we intend to enter into additional licenses of third-party intellectual property in the future. Although our goal is to obtain exclusivity in our licensing transactions, we cannot guarantee that no third parties will step forward and assert inventorship or ownership in our in-licensed patents. In some cases, we may rely on the assurances of our licensors that all ownership rights have been secured and that all necessary agreements are intact or forthcoming.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability or the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property and, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights in our field. We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which are licensed to us. Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we have licensed, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome jurisdictions may require us, or those from whom we license patents, to grant licenses to third parties. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities.\nMany countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief from an infringement and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. If we or\nthose from whom we license patents are required to issue compulsory licenses, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nOther entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import products, or impair our competitive position. In addition, other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that cover our current research and preclinical studies. While there are statutory exemptions to patent infringement for those who are using third party patented technology in the process of pursuing FDA regulatory approval, the U.S. case law pertaining to such exemptions changes over time. Lawsuits involving such exemptions are very fact intensive and it is currently unclear under U.S. case law whether preclinical studies would always qualify for such an exemption, and whether such exemptions would apply to research tools. To the extent that our current research and preclinical studies may be covered by the patent rights of others, the risk of suit may continue after such patents expire because the statute of limitations for patent infringement runs for six years. To the extent that a third party develops and patents technology that covers our products, we may be required to obtain licenses to that technology, which licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent, or circumvent the third-party patent, which would be costly and would require significant time and attention of our management. Third parties may have or obtain by license or assignment valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts.\nThird parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of others. In addition, a third-party may claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore, in connection with our third-party license agreements, we generally have agreed to indemnify the licensor for costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations. Our involvement in patent litigation and other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nWe may become subject to product liability for our diagnostic tests, clinical trials, pharmaceutical products and medical device products.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and diagnostics tests. Our reputation and the public image of our products or technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected or our products are perceived as difficult to use. Our products are complex and may develop or contain undetected defects or errors. Furthermore, if a future product candidate harms people, or is alleged to be harmful, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, corporate partners or others. We have product liability insurance covering commercial sales of current products and our ongoing clinical trials. Any defects or errors could lead to the filing of product liability claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend and result in substantial damages. If we experience a sustained material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could\nmaterially harm our business. We cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. A product liability claim could have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.\nWe may from time to time become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability, contractual and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers requesting comment and information on allegations of billing irregularities and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits, third parties or other sources. The health care industry is subject to substantial federal and state government regulation and audit. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the Company\u2019s reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position.\nMedicare legislation and future legislative or regulatory reform of the health care system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products and provide our laboratory services profitably. While many of the proposed policy changes require congressional approval to implement, we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs. Any changes that lower reimbursement rates under Medicare, Medicaid or private payor programs could negatively affect our business.\nMost significantly, on March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cReconciliation Act\u201d) and, combined we refer to both Acts as the \u201c2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.\u201d The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed on June 28, 2012 by the Supreme Court of the United States (the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d). Specifically, the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate and includes changes to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of third-party payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, the creation of a government-sponsored healthcare insurance source, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Additionally, restructuring the coverage of medical care in the U.S. could impact the reimbursement for diagnostic tests. If reimbursement for our diagnostic tests is substantially less than we or our clinical laboratory customers expect, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nBeyond coverage and reimbursement changes, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices in January 2013. This excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future.\nFurther, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are covered by Medicare and Medicaid to record all transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals starting on August 1, 2013 and to begin reporting the same for public disclosure to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by March 31, 2014. Several other states and a number of countries worldwide have adopted or are considering the adoption of similar transparency laws. The failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nRegulations under the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation are expected to continue being drafted, released and finalized throughout the next several years. Pending the promulgation of these regulations, we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval outside the U.S. will prevent us from marketing our product candidates abroad.\nWe intend to market certain of our existing and future product candidates in non-U.S. markets. In order to market our existing and future product candidates in the European Union and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had limited interactions with non-U.S. regulatory authorities, the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or clearance. Approval or clearance by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authority does not ensure approval by other regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or clearance. We may not obtain non-U.S. regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for non-U.S. regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our existing and future product candidates in any market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-U.S. governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market certain of our existing and future product candidates in both the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product. In some countries, particularly countries of the European Union, each of which has developed its own rules and regulations, pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug or medical device candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our existing and future product candidates to other available products. If reimbursement of our future product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPotential political, economic and military instability in the State of Israel, where we have office, laboratory and manufacturing operations, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain office, laboratory and manufacturing facilities in the State of Israel. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our ability to conduct business. Since the State of Israel was established in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could affect adversely our operations. Ongoing and revived hostilities or other Israeli political or economic factors could harm our operations and product development and cause our revenues to decrease.\nDue to the international scope of our business activities, our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from international sales, subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the U.S. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions. Certain countries in which we operate or may operate have experienced geopolitical instability, economic problems and other uncertainties from time to time. To the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world, or the collectability of receivables, our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected. Although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market, we may manage exposures arising in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts whereby exchange rates change, gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts. However, our subsidiaries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies. To the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in their local currencies, a devaluation of those currencies versus the U.S. dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. For financial reporting purposes, such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since earnings denominated in foreign currencies would be converted to U.S. dollars at a decreased value. While we have employed economic cash flow and fair value hedges to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations, the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact\nresulting from currency variations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official or political party for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. We have operations and agreements with third parties and we generate sales internationally. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized and illegal payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nViolations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.\nOur operations, both within and outside the U.S., are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business in government tenders that are held annually in many cases, nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments, expropriation and other governmental actions, changes in taxation, including legislative changes in U.S. and international taxation of income earned outside of the U.S., importation limitations, export control restrictions, violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic destabilization, political and economic instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region - due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers - regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS\nAcquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources, result in disruptions to our business or distractions of our management, may not proceed as planned, and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. We intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of, investments in and strategic alliances with companies, technologies, products, and services. Acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances involve a number of special problems and risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, services, operations, and personnel with the existing businesses;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the businesses;\n\u2022\nstrain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations and investments;\n\u2022\ndifficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at businesses that we acquire or invest in, particularly if they are not located near our existing operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies or companies in which we invest;\n\u2022\npotential costly and time-consuming litigation, including stockholder lawsuits;\n\u2022\npotential issuance of securities to equity holders of the company being acquired with rights that are superior to the rights of holders of our Common Stock, or which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe need to incur additional debt or use cash; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement to record potentially significant additional future operating costs for the amortization of intangible assets.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses we acquire or invest in may not produce the revenues, earnings, or business synergies that we anticipated, and acquired products, services, or technologies might not perform as we expected. As a result, we may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues than we had anticipated. We may not be able to successfully address these problems and we cannot assure you that the acquisitions or investments will be successfully identified and completed or that, if completed, the acquired businesses, investments, products, services, or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other negative effects on our business.\nAny of these risks can be greater if an acquisition or investment is large relative to our size. Failure to manage effectively our growth through acquisitions could adversely affect our growth prospects, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFunding may not be available for us to continue to make acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances in order to grow our business.\nWe have made and anticipate that we may continue to make acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances with complementary businesses, technologies, products and services to expand our business. Our growth plans rely, in part, on the successful completion of future acquisitions. At any particular time, we may need to raise substantial additional capital or to issue additional equity to finance such acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding on acceptable terms, or at all, or obtain the stockholder approvals necessary to issue additional equity to finance such acquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the financing, our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions and a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and we are required to perform an annual, or in certain situations a more frequent, assessment for possible impairment for accounting purposes. At December 31, 2014, we have goodwill and other intangible assets of $1.1 billion, or approximately 85% of our total assets. If we do not achieve our planned operating results, we may be required to incur a non-cash impairment charge. Any impairment charges in the future will adversely affect our results of operations. A significant write down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nresults of our clinical trials and other development efforts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our Common Stock is covered by analysts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device industry;\n\u2022\nthe results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our Common Stock or other securities, including debt;\n\u2022\npurchases and sales of our Common Stock by our officers, directors or affiliates;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, or strategic alliances; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our Common Stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our Common Stock.\nTrading of our Common Stock may be limited and restrictions imposed by securities regulation may further reduce our trading, making it difficult for our stockholders to sell shares.\nOur Common Stock began trading on the American Stock Exchange, now known as the NYSE MKT, in June 2007. In September 2011, we transferred the listing of our Common Stock from the NYSE MKT to the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Historically, the liquidity of our Common Stock has been limited. A substantial amount of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock are restricted securities. These factors may result in lower prices for our Common Stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our Common Stock. In addition, without a large float, our Common Stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our Common Stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his investment in our Common Stock. Further, the limited liquidity could be an indication that the trading price is not reflective of the actual fair market value of our Common Stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock could reduce our stock price.\nSome or all of the \u201crestricted\u201d shares of our Common Stock issued to former stockholders of Froptix and Acuity in connection with the acquisition or held by other of our stockholders may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to an effective registration statement, or beginning April 2, 2008, pursuant to Rule 144. We have also issued or agreed to issue a substantial number of securities in private placement transactions with two year lockup restrictions which expired in each of December 2009, August 2010, and February 2011. In connection with our Series D Preferred Stock offering, shares were issued with a three year lockup restriction that expired in September 2012. On March 8, 2013, the Company converted each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock into ten shares of Common Stock. In January 2013, we also entered into note purchase agreements with various purchasers (collectively, the \u201cPurchasers\u201d) for the sale of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes. The 2033 Senior Notes will be convertible at any time on or after November 1, 2032, through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, at the option of the holders. Additionally, holders may convert their 2033 Senior Notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding November 1, 2032, upon the occurrence of specified events. The 2033 Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 141.4827 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $7.07 per share of Common Stock), and will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. On August 30, 2013, one of the conversion rights in the 2033 Senior Notes was triggered. Holders of the 2033 Senior Notes converted $16.9 million principal amount into 2,396,145 shares of our Common Stock at a rate of 141.48 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes. In June 2014, we also entered into an exchange agreement with a holder of the Company\u2019s 2033 Senior Notes pursuant to which such holder exchanged $70.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes for 10,974,431 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and approximately $0.8 million in cash representing accrued interest through the date of completion of the exchange. As of February 20, 2015, $87.6 million of 2033 Senior Notes remain outstanding. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 or the 2033 Senior Notes are converted, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nDirectors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a majority of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAs of February 17, 2015, our directors, executive officers, principal stockholders, and affiliated entities beneficially owned, in the aggregate a majority of our outstanding voting securities. Frost Gamma Investments Trust (\u201cGamma Trust\u201d), of which Phillip Frost, M.D., the Company\u2019s Chairman and CEO, is the sole trustee, is deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 38.8% of our Common Stock as of February 17, 2015. As a result, Dr. Frost acting with other members of management, would have the ability to control the election of our Board of Directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nA significant short position in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock.\nHistorically, there has been a significant \u201dshort\u201d position in our common stock. As of February 13, 2015, investors held a short position of approximately 47,799,891 million shares of our common stock which represented approximately 22.97% of our public float. The anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline. Such stock price decrease could encourage further short-sales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price. This could lead to further increases in the already large short position in our common stock and cause volatility in our stock price. The volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment to decline rapidly. Additionally, if our stock price declines, it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of year end. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses or changes in internal control that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We have identified that we have a material weakness as of December 31, 2013, which related to the Company\u2019s financial statement close process at its Chilean subsidiary due to the lack of sufficient controls to assure that inventory and accounts receivable balances are recoded correctly in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2013. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Although we are taking steps to improve the control environment at our Chilean operations, we cannot assure you that we will at all times in the future be able to report that our internal controls are effective. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our results of operation could be harmed. Our failure to maintain the effective internal control over financial reporting could cause the cost related to remediation to increase and could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, may be subject to regulatory sanction, and investors may lose confidence in our financial statements.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nThere have been changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and rules promulgated by the NYSE and the other national securities exchanges. These new or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we could be subject to liability under applicable laws or our reputation may be harmed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe exercise of warrants we have issued may result in dilution to the holders of our Common Stock and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 21,429,746 shares of our Common Stock. The exercise of warrants has, or may, result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. The possibility of the issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of warrants could cause our stock price to decline as well.", "PERMNO": 82567, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "OPK"}
