{"cik": "1113256", "company": "MERITOR, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations can be impacted by a number of risks, including those described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. Any of these individual risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This effect could be compounded if multiple risks were to occur.\nIndustry and Operational Risks\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic is having, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue adversely affecting public health, the global economy and financial markets, as well as our industry, customers, operations, workforce, supply chains, distribution systems and the availability of manufacturing inputs, potentially throughout 2022. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products, as well as the potential for restrictions on our ability to operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government health officials recommended and mandated at times precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions on public gatherings, travel restrictions and other similar measures. As a result, we and certain of our customers and suppliers temporarily closed select manufacturing locations during the second half of fiscal year 2020. It is currently unclear if further closures may be necessary in the future. Our results will be adversely impacted by any such closures and may be adversely impacted by other actions taken to contain the spread or mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are numerous uncertainties that have risen from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the likelihood of resurgences of the outbreak, including due to the emergence and spread of variants, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease, the timing, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, and unintended consequences of the foregoing. As a result, the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The situation continues to evolve and additional impacts, which we are unable to predict or plan for, including expenses related to subsequent commercial or employment related litigation, may arise.\nOn November 4, 2021, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") filed an Emergency Temporary Standard (\"ETS\") with the Office of the Federal Registrar mandating that employers with more than 100 employees must ensure that their employees are either fully vaccinated or subject to weekly COVID-19 testing and mask wearing by January 4, 2022. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the enforceability of the OSHA ETS or the impact it will have on our workforce. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our business operates. Our implementation of these requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to execute our M2022 Plan.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we announced our M2022 plan, a multi-year plan to drive growth, expand margins, expand earnings per share, and generate cash and value. In connection with the plan, we established certain financial goals relating to securing new revenue, profit improvement and cash flow generation. The M2022 plan is based on our current planning assumptions, and achievement of the plan is subject to a number of risks. Our plan includes assumptions that we are able to successfully launch new products, secure new business wins, expand our current customer relationships, reduce costs, and that demand for our products is not further affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and any price increases in raw materials or other manufacturing costs are substantially offset by customer recovery mechanisms. If our assumptions are incorrect, if management is not able to execute the plan or if our business suffers from any number of additional risks set forth herein, we may not be able to achieve the financial goals we have announced for the M2022 plan.\nWe depend on large OEM customers, and loss of sales to these customers or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations, or to obtain new customers, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon large OEM customers with substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial terms. In addition, we have long-term contracts with certain of these customers that are subject to renegotiation and renewal from time to time. Loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any of our large volume customers for whatever reason (including, but not limited to, loss of contracts or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations, loss of market share by these customers, insolvency of such customers, reduced or delayed customer requirements, plant shutdowns, strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by such customers), continued reduction of prices to these customers, or a\nfailure to obtain new customers, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. There can be no assurance that we will not lose all or a portion of sales to our large volume customers, or that we will be able to offset any reduction of prices to these customers with reductions in our costs or by obtaining new customers.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, sales to customers that accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales included AB Volvo, Daimler AG and PACCAR, which represented approximately 24 percent, 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2021.\nThe amount of our sales to large OEM customers, including the realization of future sales from awarded business or obtaining new business or customers, is inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that these OEM customers actually produce and sell. Several of our significant customers have major union contracts that expire periodically and are subject to renegotiation. Any strikes or other actions that affect our customers' production during this process would also affect our sales. Further, to the extent that the financial condition, including bankruptcy or market share, of any of our largest customers deteriorates or their sales otherwise continue to decline, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our customers generally have the right to replace us with another supplier under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we may not in fact realize all of the future sales represented by our awarded business. Any failure to realize these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to manage rapidly changing production and sales volume in the commercial vehicle market may adversely affect our results of operations.\nProduction and sales in the commercial vehicle market have historically been volatile. Our business may experience difficulty in adapting to rapidly changing production and sales volumes. In an upturn of the cycle, when demand increases for production, we may have difficulty in meeting such extreme or rapidly increasing demand. This difficulty may include not having sufficient manpower or working capital to meet the needs of our customers or relying on other suppliers who may not be able to respond quickly to a changed environment when demand increases rapidly. In addition, certain volume requirements can necessitate premium freight and the associated costs to support the customer demand. In contrast, in the downturn of the cycle, we may have difficulty sustaining profitability given fixed costs (as further discussed below).\nA downturn in the global economy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant downturn in the global economy, which adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows during fiscal year 2021. Although there have been signs of a recovery, there is still uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, past recessions have had a significant adverse impact on our business, customers and suppliers. Our cash and liquidity needs are impacted by the level, variability and timing of our customers' worldwide vehicle production and other factors outside of our control. If the global economy experiences another significant decline in the future, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would be materially adversely affected.\nOur levels of fixed costs can make it difficult to adjust our cost base to the extent necessary, or to make such adjustments on a timely basis, and continued volume declines can result in non-cash impairment charges as the value of certain long-lived assets is reduced. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations have been and would be expected to continue to be adversely affected during periods of prolonged declining production and sales volumes in the commercial vehicle markets.\nThe negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations from continued volume declines could also have negative effects on our liquidity. If cash flows are not available from our operations, we may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs; however, we cannot predict whether that funding will be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, in the event of reduced sales, levels of receivables would decline, which would lead to a decline in funding available under our U.S. receivables facilities or under our European factoring arrangements.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers' worldwide vehicle production and payment terms with our customers and suppliers. As production volumes\nincrease, our working capital requirements to support the higher volumes generally increase. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and for borrowings under our borrowing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.\nIn addition, since many of our accounts receivable factoring programs support our working capital requirements in Europe, any dissolution of the European monetary union, if it were to occur, or any other termination of our European factoring agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to renegotiate such agreements or find alternative sources of liquidity.\nOne of our consolidated joint ventures in China participates in bills of exchange programs to settle accounts receivable from its customers and obligations to its trade suppliers. These programs are common in China and generally require the participation of local banks. Any disruption in these programs, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to find alternative sources of liquidity.\nWe operate in an industry that is cyclical and that has periodically experienced significant year-to-year fluctuations in demand for vehicles; we also experience seasonal variations in demand for our products.\nThe industries in which we operate have been characterized historically by significant periodic fluctuations in overall demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and other vehicles for which we supply products, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in demand for our products. The length and timing of any cycle in the vehicle industry cannot be predicted with certainty.\nProduction and sales of the vehicles for which we supply products generally depend on economic conditions and a variety of other factors that are outside our control, including freight tonnage, customer spending and preferences, vehicle age, labor relations and regulatory requirements. In particular, demand for our Commercial Truck segment products can be affected by a pre-buy before the effective date of new regulatory requirements, such as changes in emissions standards. Historically, implementation of new, more stringent, emissions standards has increased heavy-duty truck demand prior to the effective date of the new standards, and correspondingly decreased this demand after the new standards are implemented. In addition, any expected increase in the heavy-duty truck demand prior to the effective date of new emissions standards may be offset by instability in the financial markets and resulting economic contraction in the U.S. and worldwide markets.\nSales from the aftermarket portion of our Aftermarket and Industrial segment depend on overall levels of truck ton miles and gross domestic product (GDP), among other things, and may be influenced by times of slower economic growth or economic contraction based on the average age of commercial truck fleets.\nWe may also experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products to the extent that vehicle production fluctuates. Historically, for most of our business, demand has been somewhat lower in the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, when OEM plants may close during model changeovers and vacation and holiday periods or when there are fewer selling days during the quarter. In addition, our aftermarket business and our operations in India generally experience seasonally higher demand in the quarter ending March 31.\nRising prices for raw materials, as well as labor and transportation costs, are adversely affecting, and are expected to continue adversely affecting, our business and financial results.\nPrices of raw materials, primarily steel, for our manufacturing needs and costs of labor and transportation have risen sharply over the past year. These steel price increases, along with increasing labor and transportation costs, are creating pressure on profit margins, and they are expected to continue unfavorably impacting our financial results going forward. While we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major OEMs, the price adjustment programs typically lag the increase in steel costs and have generally not contemplated all non-index-related increases in steel costs. Raw material price fluctuation, together with the volatility of the commodity markets, which can be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws and tariffs, will continue to pose risks to our financial results. We are also experiencing ongoing labor shortages in the certain geographies and increased competition for qualified candidates. These shortages could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and are increasing labor costs, which reduce our profitability. If we are unable to pass price increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nEscalating price pressures from customers may adversely affect our business.\nTo a certain extent, pricing pressure by OEMs is a characteristic of the commercial vehicle industry. Virtually all OEMs have price reduction initiatives and objectives each year with their suppliers, and such actions are expected to continue in the future. Accordingly, we must be able to reduce our operating costs in order to maintain our current margins. Price reductions have impacted our margins and may do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid future customer price reductions or offset future customer price reductions through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives or other cost reduction initiatives.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nEach of Meritor's businesses operates in a highly competitive environment. We compete worldwide with a number of North American and international providers of components and systems, some of which are owned by or associated with some of our customers. Certain OEMs manufacture products for their own use that compete with the types of products we supply, and any future increase in this activity could displace Meritor's sales. In addition, cost reduction strategies in our industry have led to an increase in the consolidation and globalization of OEMs and their suppliers, which could increase the amount of competition or displacement we face from OEMs that manufacture products similar to ours for their own use or from suppliers that are affiliated with or otherwise supported by OEMs.\nTechnological changes in our industry could materially reduce the demand for our products and services.\nThe commercial vehicle market is experiencing a period of significant technological change as a result of the trends toward electrified drivetrains and the integration of advanced electronics into traditional products. These trends have led to an increase in the significance of technology to our current and future products and the amount of capital we need to invest to develop these new technologies, as well as an increase in the amount of competition we face from technology focused new market entrants. We are investing in the development of new products and technologies, but the future market acceptance and investment returns for these products are uncertain. If we misjudge the amount of capital to invest or are otherwise unable to continue providing products that meet our customers\u2019 needs in this environment of rapid technological change, our market competitiveness could be adversely affected as demand for our current products and services is reduced.\nA disruption in supply of raw materials or parts could impact our production and increase our costs.\nSome of our significant suppliers have experienced weak financial conditions in the past. In addition, some of our significant suppliers are located in developing countries. We are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. The inability of a supplier to meet these requirements, the loss of a significant supplier, or any labor issues or work stoppages at a significant supplier could disrupt the supply of raw materials and parts to our facilities and could have an adverse effect on us.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if a significant customer were to experience a work stoppage, that customer could halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in shutting down the related manufacturing facilities. Also, a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could result in shutting down manufacturing facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks.\nWe have a significant number of facilities and operations outside the United States, including investments and joint ventures in developing countries. During fiscal year 2021, approximately 46 percent of our sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the United States. Our strategy to grow in emerging markets may put us at risk due to the risks inherent in operating in such markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Risks with respect to currency exchange rate fluctuations (as more fully discussed above);\n\u2022Risks to our liquidity if the European monetary union were to dissolve and we were unable to renegotiate European factoring agreements or find alternative sources of liquidity;\n\u2022Risks arising in the event one or more countries exit the European monetary union;\n\u2022Local economic and political conditions;\n\u2022Disruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\u2022Possible terrorist attacks or acts of aggression that could affect vehicle production or the availability of raw materials or supplies;\n\u2022Restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including import and export duties, quotas and customs duties and tariffs);\n\u2022Changes in legal or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022Import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022Limitations on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022Difficulty in obtaining distribution and support;\n\u2022Nationalization;\n\u2022The laws and policies of the United States and foreign governments affecting trade, foreign investment and loans;\n\u2022The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022Tax laws; and\n\u2022Labor disruptions.\nThere can be no assurance that these risks will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales or on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which have unique risks.\nWe conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures, many of which act as our suppliers, pursuant to the terms of the agreements that we entered into with our partners. We may share management responsibilities and information with one or more partners that may not share our goals and objectives. Additionally, one or more partners may fail to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts may arise between us and any of our partners, the ownership of one of our partners may change or our ability to control decision making or compliance with applicable rules and regulations may be limited. Additionally, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations. Accordingly, any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur strategic initiatives may be unsuccessful, may take longer than anticipated, or may result in unanticipated costs.\nThe success and timing of any future divestitures and acquisitions will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. If we engage in acquisitions, we may finance these transactions by borrowing or issuing additional debt or equity securities. The additional debt from any such acquisitions, if consummated, could increase our debt to capitalization ratio. In addition, the ultimate benefit of any acquisition would depend on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired entity or assets into our existing business and to achieve any projected synergies. There is also no assurance that the total costs associated with any current or future restructuring will not exceed our estimates, or that we will be able to achieve the intended benefits of these restructurings.\nShifting trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has attempted to renegotiate or terminate certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and certain commercial vehicle parts, which\nresulted in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. In response to these tariffs, a number of U.S. trading partners imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products, making it more costly for us to export our products to those countries. If we are unable to pass price increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, or if demand for our exported products decreases due to the higher cost, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, further tariffs or other trade restrictions could be implemented on a broader range of products or raw materials. Any resulting environment of retaliatory trade or other practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customers, suppliers and the global economy.\nFinancial Risks\nOur liquidity, including our access to capital markets and financing, could be constrained by limitations in the overall credit market, our credit ratings, our ability to comply with financial covenants in our debt instruments, and our suppliers suspending normal trade credit terms on our purchases, or by other factors beyond our control.\nOur current senior secured revolving credit facility matures in June 2024. Upon expiration of this facility, we will require a new or renegotiated facility (which may be smaller and have less favorable terms than our current facility) or other financing arrangements. Our ability to access additional capital in the long term will depend on availability of capital markets and pricing on commercially reasonable terms, as well as our credit profile at the time we are seeking funds, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to access additional capital.\nOn November 15, 2021, our Standard & Poor\u2019s corporate credit rating and senior unsecured credit rating were BB and BB-, respectively, and our Moody\u2019s Investors Service corporate credit rating and senior unsecured credit rating were Ba3 and B1, respectively. Any lowering of our credit ratings could increase our cost of future borrowings, reduce our access to capital markets and result in lower trading prices for our securities.\nOur liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require more accelerated payment terms, including payment in advance or payment on delivery of purchases. If this were to occur, we would be dependent on other sources of financing to bridge the additional period between payment of our suppliers and receipt of payments from our customers.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could impact the availability and cost of credit which could negatively affect our business.\nDisruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring of certain financial institutions, and the lack of liquidity generally could impact the availability and cost of incremental credit for many companies and may adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged. Such disruptions could adversely affect the U.S. and world economy, further negatively impacting consumer spending patterns in the transportation and industrial sectors. In addition, as our customers and suppliers respond to rapidly changing consumer preferences, they may require access to additional capital. If that capital is not available or its cost is prohibitively high, their businesses would be negatively impacted, which could result in further restructuring, insolvency or even reorganization under bankruptcy laws. Any such negative impact, in turn, could negatively affect our business either through loss of sales to any of our customers so affected or through inability to meet our commitments (or inability to meet them without excess expense) because of loss of supplies from any of our suppliers so affected. There are no assurances that government responses to these disruptions would restore consumer confidence or improve the liquidity of the financial markets.\nIn addition, disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility or our U.S. accounts receivable securitization facility. Our access to funds under the facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from Meritor and other borrowers within a short period of time. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.\nA violation of the financial covenants in our senior secured revolving credit facility could result in a default thereunder and could lead to an acceleration of our obligations under this facility and, potentially, other indebtedness.\nOur ability to borrow under our existing financing arrangements depends on our compliance with covenants in the related agreements, including covenants in our senior secured revolving credit facility that require compliance with certain financial ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter. To the extent that we are unable to maintain compliance with these requirements or the financial ratio covenants due to one or more of the various risk factors discussed herein or otherwise, our ability to borrow, and our liquidity, would be adversely impacted.\nAvailability under the senior secured revolving credit facility is subject to a financial covenant based on the ratio of our priority debt (consisting principally of amounts outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility, U.S. accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs, and third-party non-working capital foreign debt) to EBITDA. We are required to maintain a total priority-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 2.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through maturity.\nIf an amendment or waiver is needed (in the event we do not comply with one of these covenants) and not obtained, we would be in violation of that covenant, and the lenders would have the right to accelerate the obligations upon the vote of the lenders holding more than 50% of outstanding loans thereunder. A default under the senior secured revolving credit facility could also constitute a default under our outstanding convertible notes, as well as our U.S. receivables facility, and could result in the acceleration of these obligations. In addition, a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility could result in a cross-default or the acceleration of our payment obligations under other financing agreements. If our obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility and other financing arrangements are accelerated as described above, our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay these obligations, and the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our substantial international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including risks in connection with our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. While we employ financial instruments to hedge certain of our foreign currency exchange risks relating to these transactions, our efforts to manage these risks may not be successful. In addition, we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating income, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating income. For fiscal years 2019 and 2020, our reported financial results were adversely affected by appreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. For fiscal year 2021, our reported financial results were positively affected by depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.\nEnvironmental, Tax, Asbestos and Other Regulatory Risks\nWe are exposed to environmental, health and safety and product liabilities.\nOur business is subject to liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety matters. In addition, we are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, and we could be held liable for damages arising out of exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental or natural resource damages. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and tend to be increasingly stringent. As a result, our future costs to comply with such laws and regulations may increase significantly. There is also an inherent risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, in the commercial vehicle industry if our products fail to perform to specifications or are alleged to cause property damage, injury or death.\nWith respect to environmental liabilities, we have been designated as a potentially responsible party at ten Superfund sites (excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally determined). In addition to the Superfund sites, various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us alleging violations of U.S. and foreign federal, state and local environmental protection requirements or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments. We establish reserves for these liabilities when we determine that the company has a probable obligation and we can reasonably estimate it, but the process of estimating environmental liabilities is complex and dependent on evolving physical and scientific data at the site, uncertainties as to remedies and technologies to be used, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies. The actual amount of costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could materially exceed our current estimates because of these and other uncertainties which make it difficult to predict actual costs\naccurately. In future periods, new laws and regulations, changes in remediation plans, advances in technology and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy could significantly change our estimates and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.\nImpairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets and goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause our operating results and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their current fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets and goodwill include changes impacting the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of any downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or operating results. If the value of long-lived assets or goodwill is impaired, our earnings and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740 \"Income Taxes,\" each quarter we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in laws or regulations could have a material impact on the company's overall tax position.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total earnings before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying component (an individual entity) or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in certain jurisdictions that have valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets provide no current financial statement tax benefit unless required under the intra-period allocation requirements of FASB ASC Topic 740, \"Income Taxes\" (\"ASC Topic 740\"). As a result, changes in the mix of projected earnings between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate.\nOur unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740 could significantly change.\nASC Topic 740 defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. This topic requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is \"more-likely-than-not\" to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The more-likely-than-not threshold represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the position are to be recognized. Moreover, the more-likely-than-not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. In the event that the more-likely-than-not threshold is not met, we would be required to change the relevant tax position, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be restricted on the use of tax attributes from a tax law \"ownership change.\"\nSections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" to use its tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits. In general, an \"ownership change\" occurs if shareholders owning five percent or more (applying certain look-through rules) of an issuer's outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than fifty percentage points within any three-year period over such shareholders' lowest percentage ownership during this period. If we were to issue new shares of stock, such new shares could contribute to such an \"ownership change\" under U.S. tax law. Moreover, not every event that could contribute\nto such an \"ownership change\" is within our control. If an \"ownership change\" under Sections 382 or 383 were to occur, our ability to utilize tax attributes in the future may be limited.\nWe are exposed to asbestos litigation liability.\nWe, along with many other companies, have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos used in certain components of products of Rockwell International Corporation (\"Rockwell\"). Liability for these claims was transferred to us at the time of the spin-off of Rockwell's automotive business to Meritor in 1997.\nThe uncertainties of asbestos claims and other litigation, including the outcome of litigation with insurance companies regarding the scope of asbestos coverage and the long-term solvency of our insurance carriers, make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate resolution of asbestos claims. The possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process increases that uncertainty. Although we have established reserves to address asbestos liability and corresponding receivables for recoveries from our insurance carriers, if our assumptions with respect to the nature of pending and future claims, the cost to resolve claims and the amount of available insurance prove to be incorrect, the actual amount of liability for asbestos-related claims, and the effect on us, could differ materially from our current estimates and, therefore, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIntellectual Property, Information Security and Pension Risks\nAssertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business.\nOur industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert against us and our customers and distributors their patents and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.\nClaims that our products or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to defend or settle, and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our supply agreements require us to indemnify our customers and distributors from third-party infringement claims, which have in the past and may in the future require that we defend those claims and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. We do not know whether we will prevail in these proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u2022Cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products or technology;\n\u2022Pay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022Expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products or technology;\n\u2022License technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022Enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall intellectual property portfolio; or\n\u2022Pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, distributors, employees and consultants, and security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022Any of our present or future patents will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or, in the case of third-party patents licensed or sub-licensed to us, be licensed to others;\n\u2022Any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\u2022Our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; or\n\u2022Any of the trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others.\nIn addition, we may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies, or design around the patents we own or license. Our existing and future patents may be circumvented, blocked, licensed to others, or challenged as to inventorship, ownership, scope, validity or enforceability. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the U.S., or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.\nA breach or failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe recognize the increasing volume of cyber-attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Each year, we evaluate the threat profile of our industry to stay abreast of trends and to provide reasonable assurance our existing countermeasures will address any new threats identified. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of malfeasance, acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest, and denial of service attacks, any of which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property and trade secrets or business disruption. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are exposed to the rising cost of pension benefits.\nThe commercial vehicle industry, like other industries, continues to be impacted by the cost of pension benefits. In estimating our expected obligations under our pension plans, we make certain assumptions as to economic and demographic factors, such as discount rates and investment returns. If actual experience with these factors is worse than our assumptions, our obligations could be larger than estimated which could in turn increase the amount of mandatory contributions to these plans in the coming years. Our pension plans were overfunded by $51 million as of September 30, 2021.", "PERMNO": 85349, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "MTOR"}
