{"cik": "70793", "company": "NBTY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nPlease carefully consider the following risk factors, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that may appear immaterial, also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe the nutritional supplement market is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of nutritional supplements generally, as well as of products distributed specifically by us. Consumer perception of our products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, national media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of nutritional supplements. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the nutritional supplement market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for our products, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of nutritional supplements in general, or our products specifically, or associating the consumption of nutritional supplements with illness, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers' failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed.\nOur success is linked to the size and growth rate of the vitamin, mineral and supplement market and an adverse change in the size or growth rate of that market could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAn adverse change in size or growth rate of the vitamin, mineral and supplement market could have a material adverse effect on us. Underlying market conditions are subject to change based on economic conditions, consumer preferences and other factors that are beyond our control, including media attention and scientific research, which may be positive or negative.\nOur ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited or non-existent.\nAlthough we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as future cash from operations and availability under NBTY's revolving credit facility, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements for the foreseeable future, we may need to seek additional financing to compete effectively.\nIf we are unable to obtain capital or obtain capital on commercially reasonable terms, it could:\n\u2022 reduce funds available to us for purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 restrict our ability to introduce new services or products or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by difficult conditions and volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy. Difficult conditions in these markets and the overall economy affect our business in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022 under difficult market conditions there can be no assurance that borrowings under our revolving credit facility would be available or sufficient, and in such a case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022 in order to respond to market conditions, we may need to seek waivers of various provisions in NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, and we might not be able to obtain such waivers on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022 market conditions could result in our key customers experiencing financial difficulties and/or electing to limit spending because many consumers consider the purchase of our products discretionary, which in turn could result in decreased sales and earnings for us.\nBecause a substantial majority of our Consumer Products Group sales are to or through retail stores, we are dependent to a large degree upon the success of this channel as well as the success of specific retailers in the channel.\nApproximately 60% of our sales for fiscal 2015 were in the United States. In this market, we sell our Consumer Products Group products primarily to or through our retail stores and third-party retail stores. Because of this, we are dependent to a large degree upon the growth and success of that channel as well as the growth and success of specific retailers in the channel, which are outside our control. There can be no assurance that the retail channel will be able to grow as it faces price and service pressure from other channels.\nOne of our customers accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2015 and the loss of this customer, or any of our other major customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, Wal-Mart, individually, accounted for 18% and 19% of our Consumer Products Group segment's net sales, respectively, and 11% and 11% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As of the end of fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart, individually, accounted for 11% of our Consumer Products Group segment's total gross accounts receivable. Additionally, for fiscal 2015, our other top three Consumer Products Group customers collectively accounted for approximately 31%, of our Consumer Products Group segment's net sales and 18% of our consolidated net sales. We do not have a long-term contract with Wal-Mart or any other major customer, and the loss of this customer or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our results of operations and ability to service our debt obligations would be impacted negatively to the extent Wal-Mart is unable to make payments to us, or does not make timely payments on outstanding accounts receivables.\nComplying with new and existing government regulation, both in the United States and abroad, could increase our costs significantly, reduce our growth prospects and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by several U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CBP, the USPS, the CPSC, the Department of Agriculture, OSHA and the EPA, as well as various state, local and international laws and agencies of the localities in which our products are sold, including Health Canada and the Competition Bureau in Canada, the Food Standards Agency (\"FSA\") and the Department of Health in the United Kingdom and similar regulators in Ireland, the Netherlands, the EU and China. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation or relabeling, of our products. Some agencies, such as the FDA, could require us to remove a particular product from the market, delay or prevent the import of raw materials for the manufacture of our products, or otherwise disrupt the marketing of our products. Any such government actions would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, which could be material. Any such government actions also could lead to liability, substantial costs and reduced growth prospects. In addition, complying with the AER Act, GMPs and other legislation may impose additional costs on us, which could become significant. Moreover, there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations imposing more stringent regulatory requirements on the dietary supplement industry will not be enacted or issued or that certain agencies will not enforce the existing laws or regulations more strictly. We currently are subject to FTC consent decrees and a USPS consent order, prohibiting certain advertising claims for certain of our products. We also are subject to consent judgments under Proposition 65. A determination that we have violated these obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we could incur costs as a result of violations of or liabilities hereunder, environmental laws and regulations, or to maintain compliance with such environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations and enforcement of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time in the United States and globally. These developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting or other new requirements. These developments also could increase our costs significantly. In the United Kingdom, an application for judicial review was submitted to the High Court of Justice in 2013 on behalf of a holder of an EU-wide medicinal license for certain glucosamine products. The application sought an order that the MHRA should remove food supplement (\"FS\") status for all glucosamine products or, alternatively, remove the FS status of glucosamine-based products having dosages at levels equal to or above the licensed equivalents. The MHRA robustly defended the case and the application was rejected by the High Court in June 2014-as was a subsequent application to the High Court for leave to appeal. However, the applicant subsequently obtained leave to appeal by applying to the Court of Appeal itself. The appeal is due to be heard in May 2016 and, if ultimately successful, there may be a material negative impact on the sales of numerous glucosamine-based products currently being sold by our stores in the United Kingdom.\nIn Europe, we anticipate the enactment of legislation that could significantly impact the formulation and marketing of our products. For example, in accordance with the Supplements Directive, maximum permitted content levels for vitamin and mineral supplements are expected to be enacted but have not yet been announced. European legislation regulating food supplements other than vitamins and minerals also is expected to be introduced. The introduction of this anticipated legislation\ncould require us to reformulate our existing products to meet the new standards and, in some cases, may lead to some products being discontinued.\nThe Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation implemented in July 2007 controls the types of claims that can be made for foodstuffs (including supplements) in Europe, and the criteria a product must meet for the claims to be made. Except in relation to botanical products, after December 14, 2012, only certain permitted health claims can be made for foodstuffs, and this may impact our sales of those products in Europe.\nIn addition, the General Product Safety Directive governing product safety came into force in Europe at the beginning of 2004. This legislation requires manufacturers to notify regulators as soon as they know that a product is unsafe and gives regulators in each EU member state the power to order a product recall and, if necessary, instigate the product recall themselves. A recall of any of our products in Europe could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn China, the Food Safety Law Amendment is effective as of October 1, 2015. This legislation requires all imported food to comply with applicable national food safety standards and subjects it to inspection by the AQSIQ. Where there are no national food safety standards for some imported food, the NHFPC approval must be obtained before applying for the inspection; otherwise the food in question cannot be imported into China.\nUnder the Food Safety Law Amendment, the CFDA released draft administrative regulations regarding the registration and notification of health food products and the type of ingredients and function claims that can be used in such products. The introduction of these administrative regulations are expected to require us to reformulate our existing products to meet the new standards, file registrations or notifications, or discontinue certain products.\nThe Food Safety Law Amendment also requires overseas food manufacturers to register with AQSIQ or its local counterparts, which must establish records of the credit standing of importers, exporters and manufacturers of imported goods. The imported foods, importers, exporters or manufacturers with unsatisfactory records are subject to stricter inspection or even suspension of their import business. Any restriction or suspension of import of any of our products into China could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Food Safety Law Amendment provides for strict regulation and supervision over food claimed to have particular effects on human health, namely health food. To the extent AQSIQ or CFDA determines some of our products fall into this category, the manufacture, exportation, importation and sale of such products could be subject to the new registration and notification based registration requirements, and stricter inspection by CFDA and AQSIQ. We are in the process of applying for registration of certain of our products as health food to meet applicable requirements for manufacture and export of such products, however, the timing and successful completion of such registrations are uncertain due to the shifting landscape for registration of such products in China, as further explained immediately below.\nAQSIQ promulgated the Imported and Exported Food Safety Regulatory Measures on July 22, 2011, which provide for detailed safety and inspection requirements applicable to imported and exported food. These regulations became effective on March 1, 2012 and require us to go through complicated procedures for importing and exporting our products into and from China.\nSince 2014, in anticipation of the enactment of the Food Safety Law Amendment, the CFDA, AQSIQ, their local counterparts and certain ports of entry strengthened overall administration on dietary supplement products and their interpretation of the original Food Safety Law. The CFDA took the position that many dietary supplements should not have been sold as general foods under the original Food Safety Law and commenced actions against manufacturers and marketers of dietary\nsupplements. The CFDA has also initiated an investigation primarily focused on our categorization of prior sales of certain of our products in China as general foods.\nThe Food Safety Law Amendment and related administrative regulations have provided more clarity around the regulatory regime governing \"health food\" products and provide for a dual registration and notification based system, which is intended to create a more streamlined and simplified process compared to the registration system that was previously in place with respect to certain dietary supplements. Even though the Food Safety Law Amendment is intended to simplify the regulatory regime and registration/notification procedures for certain products going forward, certain of our products containing higher potencies or otherwise sensitive ingredients require reformulation, relabeling or discontinuance, which will have a material adverse effect on our business operations in China. In addition, the CFDA and AQSIQ may continue to take actions that can, together with the current CFDA investigation, adversely impact our ability to import products into China and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSee \"Item 1. Business-Government Regulation\" for more information about the regulatory environment in which we conduct our business.\nWe may incur material product liability claims, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating income.\nAs a retailer, marketer and manufacturer of products designed for human and animal consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury. Our products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other ingredients that are classified as foods, dietary supplements, or NHPs, and, in most cases, are not necessarily subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. One of our Canadian subsidiaries also manufactures and sells non-prescription medications such as headache and cold remedies and contract manufactures some prescription medications. Some of our products contain innovative ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. In addition, some of the products we sell are produced by third-party manufacturers. As a marketer of products manufactured by third parties, we also may be liable for various product liability claims for products we do not manufacture. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. A product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" for additional information.\nIf we experience product recalls, we may incur significant and unexpected costs, and our business reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are mislabeled or alleged to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See \"-Complying with new and existing government regulation, both in the United States and abroad, could increase our costs significantly, reduce our growth prospects and adversely affect our financial results\" and other risks summarized in this Report.\nInsurance coverage, even where available, may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising from our operations. For example, we may be liable for claims brought by users of our products or by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations. We seek to minimize these risks through various insurance contracts from third-party insurance carriers. However, our insurance coverage is subject to large individual claim deductibles, individual claim and aggregate policy limits, and other terms and conditions. We retain an insurance risk for the deductible portion of each claim and for any gaps in insurance coverage. We do not view insurance, by itself, as a material mitigant to these business risks.\nWe cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses. Any losses that insurance does not substantially cover could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe insurance industry has become more selective in offering some types of coverage and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future.\nThe insurance industry has become more selective in offering some types of insurance, such as product liability, product recall, property and directors' and officers' liability insurance. Our current insurance program is consistent with both our past level of coverage and our risk management policies. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain comparable insurance coverage on favorable terms, or at all, in the future.\nInternational markets expose us to certain risks.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we operated 1,071 retail stores outside of the United States through our Holland & Barrett International segment, including 104 franchised stores. In addition, our Consumer Products Group segment had significant sales outside of the United States. For fiscal 2015, international sales represented approximately 40% of our net sales. These international operations expose us to certain risks, including:\n\u2022 local economic conditions;\n\u2022 inflation;\n\u2022 changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits or capital to the United States;\n\u2022 exposure to currency fluctuations;\n\u2022 potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs;\n\u2022 changes and limits in export and import controls;\n\u2022 difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u2022 difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 renegotiation or modification of various agreements;\n\u2022 national and regional labor strikes;\n\u2022 increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 quarantines for products or ingredients, or restricted mobility of key personnel due to disease outbreaks;\n\u2022 government regulations and laws;\n\u2022 geographic time zone, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world;\n\u2022 political instability;\n\u2022 trademarks availability and registration issues;\n\u2022 changes in exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in taxation; and\n\u2022 wars and other hostilities.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase. These risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which we do business.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act (\"UKBA\"). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires us to maintain adequate record- keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and UKBA. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in expanding globally.\nWe may experience difficulty entering new international markets due to regulatory barriers, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems, and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems. These difficulties may prevent, or significantly increase the cost of, our international expansion.\nWe may be exposed to legal proceedings initiated by regulators in the United States or abroad that could increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating income.\nIn all jurisdictions in which we operate, non-compliance with relevant legislation can result in regulators bringing administrative, civil or, in some cases, criminal proceedings. In the United States, the FTC has brought and considered bringing actions against us in the past. In China, regulators have strengthened administration of regulations on dietary supplements products in conjunction with the Food Safety Law Amendment becoming effective on October 1, 2015 and the CFDA has initiated an investigation primarily focused on our categorization of prior sales of certain of our products in China as general foods. In the United Kingdom, it is common for regulators to prosecute retailers and manufacturers for non-compliance with legislation governing foodstuffs and medicines. In the United States, we are undergoing an audit of our compliance of unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws currently for nineteen states for the years 1986 through the present. On February 2, 2015, the State of New York Office of the Attorney General (the \"NY AG\") sent letters to several major retailers demanding that they cease and desist selling their store brands for specific manufacturing lots of a select number of popular herbal supplements that the NY AG alleges were inaccurately labeled and also began an investigation concerning the authenticity and purity of herbal supplements and associated marketing. Because we manufacture certain of these private label products, we have been subject to the NY AG's investigation as well as numerous private legal actions filed in various jurisdictions against us since the investigation. On September 9, 2015, the NY AG sent letters to fourteen separate companies, including NBTY, concerning an additional herbal product. The investigations or the related legal actions seek some combination of monetary damages, injunctive relief and specific performance. Until the investigation and the related legal actions are resolved, no final determination can be made as to the ultimate outcome of the litigation or the amount of liability on the part of NBTY. In June 2015, Health Canada completed an inspection of Good Manufacturing Practices of the OTC drug operations of our Canadian subsidiary, Vita Health. In connection with such inspection, Health Canada identified certain deficiencies primarily around electronic data management procedures in Vita Health's quality control laboratory pertaining to OTC drugs. On July 24, 2015, we submitted a remediation plan to Health Canada as Vita Health's formal response to these inspection findings which was accepted by Health Canada with respect to Vita Health's OTC operations. Vita Health also submitted a formal response to these inspection findings with respect to its Natural Health Products (NHPs) operations at the end of fiscal 2015 and expects a response from Health Canada by the end of calendar 2015. If these deficiencies are not addressed in a manner acceptable to Health Canada, additional actions may be taken by Health Canada, including, without limitation, shortened inspection cycles, additional reporting requirements or the suspension or revocation of Vita Health's OTC and/or NHP site licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable legislation could occur from time to time, and prosecution for any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See \"Item 1. Business-Government Regulation\" for additional information.\nWe may not be successful in our future acquisition endeavors, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have engaged in substantial acquisition activity. We may be unable to identify suitable targets, opportunistic or otherwise, for acquisition in the future. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. Historical instability in the financial markets indicates that obtaining future financing to fund acquisitions may present significant challenges. If we need to obtain our lenders' consent to an acquisition, they may condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility. Acquisitions involve risks, including:\n\u2022 significant expenditures of cash;\n\u2022 the risk that acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with expectations;\n\u2022 risks associated with integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022 managing geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience;\n\u2022 the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies;\n\u2022 incurrence of liabilities and claims arising out of acquired businesses;\n\u2022 inability to obtain financing; and\n\u2022 incurrence of indebtedness or issuance of additional stock.\nWe may not integrate any businesses or technologies we acquire in the future successfully and may not achieve anticipated operating efficiencies and effective coordination of sales and marketing as well as revenue and cost benefits. Acquisitions may be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Acquisitions may impact our results of operations negatively as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and other key personnel, and we may not be able to pursue our current business strategy effectively if we lose them.\nOur continued success will depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees. For additional information about these individuals, see Item 10, \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" elsewhere in this Report. Our ability to manage our operations and meet our business objectives could be affected adversely if, for any reason, we are unable to recruit and retain executive talent.\nWe are dependent on certain third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers.\nWe purchase certain important ingredients and raw materials from third-party suppliers and, in certain cases, we engage contract manfuacturers to supply us with finished products such as our protein bars and powders. The principal raw materials required in our operations are vitamins, minerals, herbs, gelatin and packaging components. We purchase the majority of our vitamins, minerals and herbal raw materials from manufacturers and distributors globally. Real or perceived quality control problems with raw materials outsourced from certain regions or finished products manufactured by contract manufacturers could negatively impact consumer confidence in our products, or expose us to liability. In addition, disruption in the operations of any such supplier or manufacturer or material increases in the price of raw materials, for any reason, such as changes in economic and political conditions, tariffs, trade disputes, regulatory requirements, import restrictions, loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, drought or other climate-related events, war or other events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also, currency fluctuations, including the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, could result in higher costs for raw materials purchased abroad. In addition, we rely on outside printing services and availability of paper stock in our printed catalog operations.\nWe rely on our manufacturing operations to produce the vast majority of the nutritional supplements that we sell, and disruptions in our manufacturing system or losses of manufacturing certifications could affect our results of operations adversely.\nWe currently operate manufacturing facilities in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Texas in the United States, and in Canada, the United Kingdom and China. All our domestic and foreign operations manufacturing products for sale to the United States are subject to GMPs promulgated by the FDA and other applicable regulatory standards, including in the areas of environmental protection and worker health and safety. We are subject to similar regulations and standards in Canada, the United Kingdom and China. Any significant disruption in our operations at any of these facilities, including any disruption due to any regulatory requirement, could affect our ability to respond quickly to changes in consumer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, we may be exposed to risks relating to the transfer of work between facilities or risks associated with opening new facilities or closing existing facilities that may cause a disruption in our operations. There have been a number of well-publicized incidents of tainted food and drugs manufactured in foreign countries such as China in the past few years. Although we have implemented GMPs in our facilities, there can be no assurance that products manufactured in our plants around the world, will not be contaminated or otherwise fail to meet our quality standards. Any such contamination or other quality failures could result in costly recalls, litigation, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our failure to compete effectively could affect our market share, financial condition and growth prospects adversely.\nThe VMHS industry is a large and growing industry and is highly fragmented in terms of both geographical market coverage and product categories. The market for vitamins and other nutritional supplements is highly competitive in all our channels of distribution. We compete with companies that may have broader product lines or larger sales volumes, or both, than we do, and our products compete with nationally advertised brand name products. Several of the national brand companies have resources greater than ours. Numerous companies compete with us in the development, manufacture and marketing of vitamins and nutritional supplements worldwide. In addition, our retail stores compete with specialty vitamin stores, health food stores and other retail stores worldwide. With respect to mail order sales, we compete with a large number of smaller mail order and internet companies, some of which manufacture their own products and some of which sell products manufactured by others. The market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. We also may face competition from low-cost entrants to the industry, including from international markets. Increased competition from companies that distribute through the wholesale channel, especially the private label market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as these competitors may have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities far greater than ours.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in some or all our markets, and our attempt to do so may require us to reduce our prices, which may result in lower margins. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our market share, business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and growth prospects. See \"Item 1. Business-Competition; Customers.\"\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products and services could harm our customer relationships and product sales significantly.\nThe nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively\nimpact consumer opinion of us as a source for the latest products, which, in turn, could harm our customer relationships and cause decreases in our net sales. The success of our new product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 accurately anticipate customer needs;\n\u2022 innovate and develop new products;\n\u2022 successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u2022 price our products competitively;\n\u2022 manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u2022 differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk of a potential shift in customer demand towards more private label products, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability. If any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. If we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to acts of God, war, sabotage and terrorism risk.\nActs of God, war, sabotage and terrorist attacks or any similar risk may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of the shopping and commercial behavior of our customers, changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, which could negatively impact the profitability of our business.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had approximately 13,100 employees. As of September 30, 2015, CAW Local 468, Retail Wholesale Canada Division represented approximately 290 of our employees in Canada under a collective bargaining agreement. If our employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, such as decreased productivity and increased labor costs. Any interruption in the delivery of our products could reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be affected adversely by increased raw material, utility and fuel costs.\nInflation and other factors affect the cost of raw materials, goods and services we use. Increased raw material and other costs may adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to pass these costs through to our customers or to benefit from offsetting cost reductions in the manufacture and distribution of our products. Furthermore, increases in fuel costs may affect our results of operations adversely in that consumer traffic to our retail locations may be reduced and the costs of our sales may increase as we incur fuel costs in connection with our manufacturing operations and the transportation of goods from our warehouse and distribution facilities to stores or direct response/e-commerce customers. Also, high oil costs can affect the cost of our raw materials and components and the competitive environment in which we operate may limit our ability to recover higher costs resulting from rising fuel prices.\nOur profits may be affected negatively by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur assets, earnings and cash flows are influenced by currency fluctuations due to the geographic diversity of our sales and the countries in which we operate. These fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. For fiscal 2015, 36% of our sales were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, and as of fiscal 2015, 29% of our assets and 7% of our total liabilities were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. We have entered into various cross currency swap transactions. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology and any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain customer records, accurately track purchases and incentive payments, manage accounting, finance and manufacturing operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Any interruption in these systems or any interruption associated with the transition of these systems to a new information technology platform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSystem interruptions or security breaches may affect sales.\nCustomer access to, and ability to use, our websites affects our Puritan's Pride sales, in addition to online sales within our Holland & Barrett International and Vitamin World segments. If we are unable to maintain and continually enhance the efficiency of our systems, we could experience system interruptions or delays that could affect our operating results negatively. In addition, we could be liable for breaches of security on our websites, loss or misuse of our customers' personal information or payment data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may negatively affect our operating results.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. Recently we have implemented, and we continue to implement, modifications and upgrades to such systems and acquired new systems with new functionality. These types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems into our current systems. These implementations, modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be able to determine the extent of unauthorized use of our trademarks and patents. In any case, such efforts are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and\nthere can be no assurance that infringing goods could not be manufactured without our knowledge and consent. Many of our products are not subject to patent protection, and thus they can be legally reverse-engineered by competitors. Moreover, even with respect to some of our products that are covered by patents, such as Ester-C\u00ae products, there are numerous similar yet non-infringing supplement products in the marketplace, and this negatively affects sales we might otherwise make. Our patents, or certain claims made in such patents, could be found to be invalid or unenforceable. From time to time we face opposition to our applications to register trademarks, and we may not ultimately be successful in our attempts to register certain trademarks. Further, there can be no assurance that in those foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business the trademark and patent protection available to us will be as extensive as the protection available to us in the United States.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims against us could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or marketing our products, which could adversely affect our revenues and market share.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or marketing our products in various jurisdictions. Claims of intellectual property infringement also may require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Claims that our technology or products infringe on intellectual property rights of others could be costly to defend or settle, could cause reputational injury and would divert the attention of management and key personnel, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are party to a number of lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business and may become party to others in the future.\nWe are party to a number of lawsuits (including product liability, false advertising, and intellectual property claims) that arise in the ordinary course of business and may become party to others in the future. The possibility of such litigation, and its timing, is in large part outside our control. It is possible that future litigation could arise, or developments could occur in existing litigation, that could have material adverse effects on us.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), have required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies. These laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made many activities more time-consuming and more burdensome. The costs of compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, we run the risk of non-compliance, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the past we have discovered, and in the future we may discover, areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement. As a result of the identification of two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination to restate the previously-issued financial statements for the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2015, management re-evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that we did not maintain effective controls for that period.\nSpecifically, effective controls were not maintained with respect to the accounting for property and equipment in connection with a triggering event and with respect to the evaluation of out-of-period adjustments. Although we believe that we are taking appropriate action to remediate the material weaknesses and have devoted significant resources to remediate any deficiencies we discovered and to improve our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses or are otherwise unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial statements, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified or that we will not need to restate our financial statements and reevaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Notes and the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.75%/8.50% Contingent Cash Pay Senior Notes due 2017 issued by Holdings (the \"Holdco Notes\").\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. At September 30, 2015, we had $2,205 million of indebtedness on a consolidated basis (including $1,508 million of borrowings under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, $650 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes, and $47 million of other indebtedness), of which $1,508 million was secured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, after adjusting for outstanding letters of credit, NBTY also had an additional $169 million available under the revolving portion of NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, as amended. In addition, as of September 30, 2015, Holdings had indebtedness of $1,000 million. While NBTY has no direct obligation under the Holdco Notes, NBTY is the sole source of cash generation for Holdings. The Holdco Notes do not appear on NBTY's balance sheet and the related interest expense is not included in NBTY's income statement.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for NBTY to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes or Holdings to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Holdco Notes;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022 restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022 expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities will be subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 expose us to additional risks related to currency exchange rates and repatriation of funds;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.\nRestrictive covenants in the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes and the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes and the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities limit our ability, and the terms of any future indebtedness may limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 incur liens; and\n\u2022 designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes and the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities also could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants (to the extent applicable at such time), or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios, could result in a default under the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities. If a default occurs, the lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities may elect to:\n\u2022 declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable; or\n\u2022 prevent us from making payments on the Notes,\neither of which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes. An event of default under either or both of these indentures or the senior secured credit facilities would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable. The lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. An event of default under either of these indentures or the senior secured credit facilities would likely result in a cross default under either or both of the other instruments. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities also have the right to proceed against the collateral, including our available cash, granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the indebtedness under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the Holdco Notes and/or the Notes were to be accelerated, we can give no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness, including the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, Holdings, NBTY and their subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nThe terms of the indenture governing the Notes, the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the Holdco Notes permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional debt, including secured debt. Any additional borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities, and any other secured debt, would be effectively senior to the Holdco Notes, the Notes and any guarantees thereof to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Holdco Notes and the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with noteholders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This could reduce the amount of proceeds available to be paid to noteholders. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of September 30, 2015, after adjusting for outstanding letters of credit, NBTY had an additional $169 million of unused commitments under the revolving portion of NBTY's senior secured credit facilities. Additionally, NBTY's senior secured credit facilities may be increased by up to $500 million (of which no more than $100 million may be under NBTY's revolving credit facility), subject to certain conditions. All of those borrowings would be secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the risks that we now face as a result of our leverage would intensify.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Holdco Notes and the Notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Holdco Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Holdco Notes, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may need to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes and the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the Notes and the indenture governing the Holdco Notes), Holdco could be required to pay interest-in-kind and/or we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may need to obtain waivers in the future from\nthe required lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe are dependent upon our lenders for financing to execute our business strategy and meet our liquidity needs. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could negatively impact our business.\nIn volatile credit markets, there is a risk that any lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments, including but not limited to: extending credit up to the maximum permitted by NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and otherwise accessing capital and/or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments, or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult in this environment to replace NBTY's senior secured credit facilities on similar terms.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn and the interest rates are above the interest rate floor set forth in NBTY's credit agreement, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $4.2 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities. However, we may maintain interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nRisks Relating to the Notes and the Holdco Notes\nThe right of holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes to receive payments on the Notes and the Holdco Notes is effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors. Further, the guarantees of the Notes and the Holdco Notes, if any, are effectively subordinated to all our guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness.\nThe Notes and the Holdco Notes are general unsecured obligations. Holders of our secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of the guarantors of the Notes will have claims that are prior to the claims of holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing that other indebtedness. Notably, Holdings, NBTY and certain of its subsidiaries, including the guarantors of the Notes, are parties to the senior secured credit facilities, which are secured by liens on substantially all our assets and the assets of such guarantors. The Notes and Holdco Notes are effectively subordinated to all our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of secured indebtedness will have a prior claim to those of our assets that constitute their collateral. Holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the Notes and the Holdco Notes, and potentially with all our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in our remaining assets. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure holders of the\nNotes and the Holdco Notes that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes or the Holdco Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes or the Holdco Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.\nAs of September 30, 2015, the aggregate amount of our secured indebtedness was approximately $1,508 million. As of September 30, 2015, we had $169 million of unused commitments available for additional borrowing under the revolving portion of NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, as amended. We are permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future under the terms of the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nThe trading prices of the Notes and the Holdco Notes may be volatile and can be affected by many factors, including our credit rating.\nThe trading price of the Notes and the Holdco Notes could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to, among other factors, changes in our operating results, interest rates, the market for non-investment grade securities, general economic conditions and securities analysts' recommendations, if any, regarding our securities.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes and the Holdco Notes, or the trading market for the Notes and the Holdco Notes, to the extent a trading market for such securities develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future and any fluctuation may impact the trading price of the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nWe may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the Notes or the Holdco Notes upon a change of control.\nUpon the occurrence of a \"change of control,\" as defined in the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes, each noteholder will have the right to require us to purchase the Notes and the Holdco Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. Our failure to purchase, or give notice of purchase of, the Notes or the Holdco Notes would be a default under the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes, which would in turn be a default under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes. In addition, a change of control may constitute an event of default under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes. A default under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the Notes and Holdco Notes could result in an event of default under the indentures if the lenders accelerate the debt under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities or the holders accelerate the debt under the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nIf a change of control occurs, we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the indenture related to the Notes and the indenture related to the Holdco Notes. Upon the occurrence of a change of control we could seek to refinance the indebtedness under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the Notes and the indenture governing the Holdco Notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders and holders of the Notes or the Holdco Notes. We can give no assurance, however, that we would be able to obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. No assurances can be given that any court would enforce the change of control provisions in the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes as written for the benefit of the holders, or as to how these change of control provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.\nHolders of the Notes or the Holdco Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes or the Holdco Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of \"substantially all\" of our assets.\nThe definition of change of control in the indentures governing the Notes and the Holdco Notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of \"all or substantially all\" of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase \"substantially all\" under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes or the Holdco Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes or Holdco Notes, respectively, as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.\nCertain private equity investment funds affiliated with Carlyle own substantially all the equity of Holdings, and their interests may not be aligned with those of the holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nCarlyle owns substantially all the fully diluted equity of Holdings, and, therefore, has the power to control our affairs and policies. Carlyle also controls, to a large degree, the election of directors, the appointment of management, the entry into mergers, sales of substantially all our assets and other extraordinary transactions. The directors so elected have authority, subject to the terms of our debt, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. Carlyle's interests could conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of Carlyle and certain of its affiliates and co-investors, as equity holders, might conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes and the Holdco Notes. Carlyle also may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to our noteholders. Additionally, Carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies, and from time to time in the future may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, or are suppliers or customers of ours.\nInvestment funds advised by entities affiliated with Carlyle and affiliates of Carlyle may buy or sell the Notes and the Holdco Notes in open market transactions at any time.\nIf a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, noteholders may receive a lesser amount for their claim than they paid for the Notes and the Holdco Notes.\nIf a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a noteholder's claim for the principal amount of the Notes or the Holdco Notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:\n\u2022 the lesser of (x) the original issue price for such notes and (y) the principal amount of such notes; and\n\u2022 any amount of interest that does not constitute \"unmatured interest\" for purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nAccordingly, under these circumstances, a noteholder may receive a lesser amount than it paid for such notes, even if sufficient funds are available.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of the Notes\nClaims of noteholders will be effectively subordinated to claims of creditors of all of NBTY's non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by NBTY's current and future domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors of NBTY's senior secured credit facilities. However, the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report include all our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. NBTY's\nforeign subsidiaries, which do not guarantee the Notes, held approximately $1.5 billion, or 30%, of our total assets and $0.3 billion, or 10%, of NBTY's total liabilities as of September 30, 2015 and accounted for approximately $1.2 billion, or 36%, of NBTY's net sales, for fiscal 2015 (all amounts presented exclude intercompany balances). In addition, NBTY has the ability to designate certain of its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, and any subsidiary so designated will not be a guarantor of the Notes.\nNBTY's non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due under the Notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that NBTY or its subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any of its non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of noteholders to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries' assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt of that subsidiary.\nNBTY is a holding company with no operations and may not have access to sufficient cash to make payments on its credit obligations.\nNBTY is a holding company and has limited direct operations. NBTY's most significant assets are the equity interests it holds in its subsidiaries. As a result, it is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law or the instruments governing its indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes, the credit agreement governing its senior secured credit facilities or other agreements of its subsidiaries. NBTY's subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable it to make principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, including the Notes. In addition, its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, except for its existing and future subsidiaries that will be the guarantors of the Notes, any payments on dividends, distributions, loans or advances to NBTY by its subsidiaries could be subject to legal and contractual restrictions on dividends. In addition, payments to NBTY by its subsidiaries will be contingent upon its subsidiaries' earnings. Additionally, NBTY may be limited in its ability to cause its existing and any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to it. Subject to certain qualifications, its subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of its indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes, to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to it. NBTY can give no assurance that agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of its subsidiaries will permit those subsidiaries to provide it with sufficient cash to fund payments of principal premiums, if any, and interest on the Notes when due. In addition, any guarantee of the Notes will be subordinated to any senior secured indebtedness of a subsidiary guarantor to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness.\nFederal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the Notes and/or the guarantees of the Notes and require noteholders to return payments received on the Notes.\nUnder federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the Notes or the guarantees thereof could be deemed a fraudulent transfer if NBTY or any of the guarantors of the Notes, as applicable, received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for either issuing the Notes or giving the guarantee and:\n\u2022 NBTY or any such guarantors, as applicable, was insolvent on the date that it issued the Notes or gave the guarantee or became insolvent as a result of issuing the Notes or giving the guarantee; or\n\u2022 the issuance of the Notes or the giving of such guarantee left NBTY or any of such guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; or\n\u2022 NBTY or any of such guarantors intended to incur, or believed that NBTY or such guarantor would incur, debts that would be beyond NBTY's or such guarantor's ability to pay as those debts matured.\nThe Notes and/or a guarantee thereof could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which NBTY or any such guarantor was or became, on or after the date of issuance of the Notes or the giving of the guarantee, as applicable, indebted.\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, NBTY or any such guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\u2022 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation; or\n\u2022 the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u2022 it could not pay its debts as they become due.\nWe cannot predict:\n\u2022 what standard a court would apply to determine whether NBTY or any such guarantor was insolvent as of the date it issued the Notes or its guarantee, as applicable, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that NBTY or such guarantor was insolvent on that date; or\n\u2022 whether a court would determine that the payments under the Notes or such guarantee constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains a \"savings clause\" intended to limit each subsidiary guarantor's liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended.\nIf a guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be subordinated to all other debts of such guarantor. In that case, any payment by such guarantor under its guarantee could be required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. If a guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease to have a claim against the subsidiary based on the guarantee and would be creditors only of NBTY and any guarantor whose guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.\nIf a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, holders of the Notes may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries' other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.\nThe lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities have the discretion to release the guarantors under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the Notes.\nWhile any obligations under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the Notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes, at the discretion of lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, if such guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness. The lenders under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under NBTY's senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. A noteholder will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of the Holdco Notes\nHoldings is a holding company and relies on dividends, loans and other payments and distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other obligations.\nHoldings is a holding company with no business operations, revenues, expenses, liabilities other than the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Holdco Notes or assets other than the capital stock of NBTY. Because Holdings' assets consist of the equity interests it holds in NBTY, Holdings is dependent upon dividends and other payments from NBTY to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law or the instruments governing certain indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes, the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the Holdco Notes or other agreements of its subsidiaries. The earnings of Holdings' subsidiaries will depend substantially on their respective financial and operating results, which will be affected by prevailing economic and competitive conditions and by financial, business and other factors beyond Holdings' and its subsidiaries' control. Holdings' subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable Holdings to make principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, including the Holdco Notes, or to fund Holdings' and its subsidiaries' other cash obligations.\nNBTY's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to Holdings (\"restricted payment capacity\") is limited under certain covenants in the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the Notes. For example, under the indenture governing the Notes, NBTY is permitted to pay dividends or make other distributions to Holdings if the total amount thereof does not exceed a formula based on the sum of (a) 50% of NBTY's consolidated net income for periods beginning with its fiscal quarter commencing October 1, 2010 and (b) the amount of certain cash proceeds and the fair market value of certain property received by or contributed to NBTY. Similarly, under the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, NBTY is permitted to pay dividends and make other distributions (or to make loans or advances in lieu thereof) to Holdings but the total amount is limited and such payments are subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, NBTY is permitted to pay dividends or make other distributions (or to make loans or advances in lieu thereof) to Holdings pursuant to the Notes formula payment of dividends, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nAs of September 30, 2015, prior to giving effect to the November 2015 interest payment of $39 million, NBTY had approximately $321 million of restricted payments capacity under its senior secured credit facilities and approximately $286 million of restricted payments capacity under the indenture governing the Notes.\nHoldings' subsidiaries are permitted, under the terms of their existing indebtedness, to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to Holdings. The indenture governing the Holdco Notes may also permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness even if Holdings would not be able to incur additional indebtedness. Agreements governing current and future indebtedness of Holdings' subsidiaries may not permit those subsidiaries to provide Holdings with sufficient cash to fund payments on the Holdco Notes when due.\nHoldings' subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Holdco Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment.\nClaims of holders of Holdco Notes will be effectively subordinated to claims of creditors of all of Holdings' subsidiaries.\nThe Holdco Notes will not be guaranteed by any of Holdings' subsidiaries. However, the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report include all of Holdings' subsidiaries. Holdings had $1.0 billion of liabilities as of September 30, 2015 and Holdings' subsidiaries held almost all of its assets and accounted for all of its net sales as of and for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nHoldings' subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Holdco Notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that Holdings has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of such subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of Holdco Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of such subsidiaries' assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of Holdings' subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt of that subsidiary.\nIf certain conditions for the payment of cash interest are not met, interest on the Holdco Notes may be payment in kind (\"PIK\") interest.\nHoldings is required to pay interest on the Holdco Notes entirely in cash unless certain conditions exist, in which case Holdings will be entitled to pay PIK interest. The terms of the Holdco Notes do not restrict Holdings' ability to use its dividend payment capacity for such alternative uses. In addition, the credit agreement governing NBTY's senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the Notes and the indenture governing the Holdco Notes allow NBTY and its subsidiaries to utilize amounts that would otherwise be available to pay cash dividends to Holdings for purposes such as making restricted investments, capital expenditures and prepaying subordinated indebtedness and, subject to certain limitations, making cash dividends to and other payments in respect of equityholders, and such uses would reduce the amounts available to pay dividends to Holdings in order to pay cash interest on the Holdco Notes. The indenture governing the Holdco Notes does not restrict Holdings' ability to use its dividends payment capacity for such alternative uses. As a result, there can be no assurance that Holdings will be required (or able) to make cash interest payments on the Holdco Notes. The payment of interest through PIK interest will increase the amount of Holdings' indebtedness and would exacerbate the risks associated with such a high level of indebtedness.\nFederal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the Holdco Notes and require holders to return payments received from Holdings.\nUnder federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, issuance of notes could be deemed a fraudulent transfer if Holdings received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for issuing the Holdco Notes and\n\u2022 Holdings was insolvent on the date that it issued the Holdco Notes or became insolvent as a result of issuing the Holdco Notes, or\n\u2022 Holdings was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which property remaining with Holdings was an unreasonably small capital, or\n\u2022 Holdings intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts that would be beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured.\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:\n\u2022 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation, or\n\u2022 the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, or\n\u2022 it could not pay its debts as they become due.\nWe cannot predict:\n\u2022 what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether Holdings was insolvent as of the date Holdings issued the Holdco Notes or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that Holdings was insolvent on that date; or\n\u2022 whether a court would determine that the payments under the Holdco Notes constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.\nIf issuance of the Holdco Notes is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be subordinated to all other debts of Holdings. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, holders of the Holdco Notes may not receive any repayment on the Holdco Notes. Further, the voidance of the Holdco Notes could result in an event of default with respect to Holdings and its subsidiaries' other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.\nFinally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Holdco Notes to other claims against Holdings under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of Holdco Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to Holdings' other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Holdco Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code.\nThe Holdco Notes were issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nBecause no portion of the stated interest on the Holdco Notes is unconditionally payable in cash at least annually, interest payments on the notes are not treated as qualified stated interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Holdco Notes were issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes (\"OID\") in an amount equal to the excess of the total payments of principal and interest on the Holdco Notes over their issue price. A holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation, whether on the cash or accrual method for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally will be required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as the OID accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), regardless of whether such holder receives any cash payment attributable to such income at such time.", "PERMNO": 56937, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "0170A"}
