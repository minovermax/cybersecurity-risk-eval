{"cik": "907471", "company": "META FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks, including those described below that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. Our business could be harmed, perhaps materially, by any of these risks, as well as other risks that we have not identified, whether due to such risks not presently being known to us, because we do not currently believe such risks to be material, or otherwise. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the Company\u2019s financial statements and related notes. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See also \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nOur growth has been robust, and failure to generate sufficient capital to support anticipated growth could cause us difficulty in maintaining regulatory capital compliance and adversely affect our earnings and prospects.\nWe have continued to experience considerable growth recently, having increased our assets from $5.23 billion at September 30, 2017 to $5.84 billion at September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily the result of the Crestmark Acquisition, as well as continued loan and lease growth. Asset growth and diversification of our lending business, primarily driven by the Crestmark Acquisition, has required and, if continued as expected, will continue to generate a need for higher levels of capital which management believes may not be met through earnings retention alone. Additionally, our asset mix has materially changed since September 30, 2017 and is expected to continue to change, as we expand and diversify our financial product offerings in the market, especially in our commercial lending and financing business and in our tax-related financial solutions divisions. These lending activities carry risk weights far in excess of traditional one- to four- family loans, and as a result it will be more difficult to maintain regulatory capital compliance.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to access sources of capital, private or public, to satisfy capital requirements in the future. Failure to remain well-capitalized, or to attain potentially even higher levels of capitalization that may be required in the future under regulatory initiatives mandated by Congress, our regulatory agencies, or under the Basel accords, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and prospects.\nWe may have difficulty continuing to grow, and even if we do grow, our growth may strain our resources and limit our ability to expand our operations successfully.\nAs described above, we have experienced significant growth in our assets, including in connection with the Crestmark Acquisition and as a result of organic growth; this is also the case with the level of our deposits, which have continued to grow. Our future profitability will depend in part on our continued ability to grow our business, including through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our growth will also depend on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses, including as a result of the Crestmark Acquisition. See also \u201cAcquisitions could disrupt our business and may not be successful.\u201d We may not, however, be able to sustain our historical growth rate or be able to grow at all. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend on competitive factors and on the ability of our senior management to continue to maintain a robust system of internal controls and procedures and manage a growing number of customer relationships. See \u201c--The Company operates in an extremely competitive market, and the Company\u2019s business will suffer if it is unable to compete effectively.\u201d We may not be able to implement changes or improvements to these internal controls and procedures in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Consequently, continued growth, if achieved, may place a strain on our operational infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a SEC reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting, which requires annual management and independent registered public accounting firm assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We have historically dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to implement our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures. Substantial work may continue to be required to further implement, document, assess, test, and, if necessary, remediate our system of internal controls. We may also need to retain additional finance and accounting personnel in the future.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be unable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, or we may otherwise be unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Additionally, our common stock listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management team could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and to claims by stockholders, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert our management's attention. See also \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures-Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" for inherent limitations in a control system.\nAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to serve as a \u201csource of strength\u201d for the Bank.\nFederal banking law codifies a requirement that savings and loan holding companies (like the Company) act as a financial \u201csource of strength\u201d for its FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiaries (like the Bank). The term \u201csource of financial strength\u201d is defined in the relevant statute as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of the financial distress of such insured depository institution. The statute permits the OCC, as the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, to request reports from the Company to assess its ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with these statutory requirements. To date, no regulations have been proposed in connection with this statutory requirement, although it is widely assumed that the Federal Reserve would enforce its prior guidance regarding this doctrine as applied to bank holding companies when applying the rule to savings and loan holding companies like the Company.\nGiven the power provided to the federal banking agencies in this provision, it is possible that we could be required to serve as a source of strength for the Bank when we might not otherwise voluntarily choose to do so. Specifically, the imposition of such financial requirements might require us to raise additional capital to support the Bank at a time when it is not otherwise prudent for us to do so; for example, such raise could be on terms that are not favorable or typical in the existing market. If we were unable to raise necessary capital, we could become subject to negative or burdensome regulatory conditions that could negatively impact our growth. Further, any capital provided by us to the Bank would be subordinate to others with interest in the Bank, including the Bank's depositors. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy of the Company at a time when it had a commitment to one of the Bank\u2019s regulators to maintain the capital of the Bank, the regulators\u2019 claims against the Company may be entitled to priority status over other obligations.\nOur loan portfolio has grown substantially, and our underwriting practices may not prevent future losses in our loan portfolio.\nOur loan portfolio has grown substantially over the last several years, primarily due to the Crestmark Acquisition and organic growth in loan originations. Our underwriting practices are designed to mitigate risk by adhering to specific loan and financing parameters. Components of our underwriting program include, where appropriate, an analysis of the borrower and their creditworthiness, a financial statement review, a business plan review, and, if applicable, cash flow projections and a valuation of collateral. Other lending programs, particularly in the Bank's divisions, rely on management experience and quantitative data. We may incur losses in our loan portfolio, especially the portion acquired in the Crestmark Acquisition for which integration efforts continue, if our underwriting practices or criteria fail to adequately identify, price, and mitigate credit risks. It is also possible that losses will exceed the amounts the Bank has set aside for loss reserves and result in reduced interest income and increased provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Deterioration in our loan portfolio could also cause a decrease in our capital, which would make it more difficult to maintain regulatory capital compliance.\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\nThe Company originates commercial loans and related financing products, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans, agricultural real estate loans, agricultural loans, and residential mortgage loans. Commercial, commercial mortgage, consumer, agricultural real estate, and agricultural loans may expose the Bank to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate, including for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nCommercial Loans and Related Financing Products. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. Moreover, due to the composition of borrowers under these loans within our portfolio (small- to medium-sized businesses), this portfolio may be more susceptible to even mild or moderate economic declines than a portfolio of loans with larger commercial borrowers.\n\u2022\nCommercial Mortgage Loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u2022\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as personal lines of credit) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss.\n\u2022\nAgricultural Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business, which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either the Bank or the borrowers. These factors include weather, commodity prices, and interest rates, among others.\n\u2022\nCommercial Insurance Premium Finance Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operations of the business. The risk is mitigated, however, because the loan is secured by the unamortized portion of the underlying insurance policy.\n\u2022\nStudent Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the obligor\u2019s fulfillment of its contractual payment obligations, which is greatly dependent on factors outside the control of the Bank.\n\u2022\nTaxpayer Advance Loans. Repayment is dependent upon an income tax refund being approved and paid by the Internal Revenue Service or a state tax authority.\nIf our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our net income will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and leases. Despite our underwriting and monitoring practices, our loan and lease customers may not repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans and leases may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan and lease balance. We may experience significant loan and lease losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Because we must use assumptions regarding individual loans and leases and the economy, the current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, and increases in the allowance may be necessary. We may need to significantly increase our provision for losses on loans and leases if one or more of our larger loans and leases or credit relationships becomes impaired or if we continue to expand our commercial real estate and commercial lending businesses or enter new lines of lending. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or recognize loan charge-offs. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. We cannot provide any assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to cover actual losses. Nonpayment of loans and leases related to the Bank\u2019s and its divisions\u2019 businesses may have a materially adverse effect on our overall financial condition and results of operation, as well as the value of our common stock.\nFurther, a new method of determining loan and lease loss allowances, expected to be implemented in fiscal year 2020, is under analysis and could impact future profitability.\nEconomic and market conditions could adversely affect our industry and regulatory costs.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon local economic and political conditions as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect asset quality, deposit levels, products, and loan and lease demand and, therefore, our earnings.\nFlat or declining national economic growth and reduced availability of commercial credit could negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit in general. Under such conditions, the broader U.S. economy could experience increased commercial and consumer credit contraction, a lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility, and widespread reduction in general business activity. Such adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our commercial and consumer borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans and leases, which would have an adverse impact to our earnings.\nThe resulting economic pressure from any or all of these events on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. A worsening of these economic conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry.\nIn particular, as a result of credit and liquidity challenges faced by the broader economy, our industry and business lines could come under new or increased supervision regulation. Although the November 2016 federal election has, to some degree, curtailed an expansion of our regulatory obligations (see \"--We operate in a highly regulated environment, and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\" below), compliance with existing and additional regulations in a distressed market would likely increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue new business opportunities, and curtail the businesses in which we operate.\nBecause we have a significant amount of real estate loans, declines in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Customer demand for loans secured by real estate may also decrease due to weaker economic conditions, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values, or an increase in interest rates.\nIn addition, the demand for commercial lending and other forms of commercial financing could weaken due to national economic conditions that cause business growth and credit needs to retract, which could diminish or delay our realization of the anticipated benefits of the Crestmark Acquisition since the Crestmark division is focused on commercial lending and financing. Further, weakened demand could adversely affect the specialty lending operations of our Crestmark division that are focused on certain industries or its factoring services because, if Crestmark is unable to collect on loans, leases or purchased receivables, Crestmark and the Bank will sustain losses, which could be material. See also \u201c-Our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\u201d\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, and determinations as to whether economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and leases. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of our underwriting processes. See also \u201c--If the Company\u2019s actual loan and leases losses exceed the Company\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses, the Company\u2019s net income will decrease.\u201d\nThe value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold, which portfolio constitutes a large percentage of our assets, may also be adversely affected by adverse market conditions.\nIf we experience financial setbacks or regulatory action in the future, we may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance premiums than we currently pay due, in part, to our significant level of brokered deposits or we could be curtailed or prohibited from accepting some or all such brokered deposits. See Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment and we are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and, to a lesser degree, the Bureau. See Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d herein. Applicable laws and regulations may change, and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations may vary when actions are evaluated by these regulators. Any such changes could adversely affect our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including, but not limited, to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of restrictions on activities, regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.\nFor example, on February 3, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13772, specifying new core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system. Among other things, the President directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with federal regulatory agencies, to review existing laws and regulations and report on the extent to which they were consistent with the core principles. Beginning in February 2017, Congress passed, and the President signed, more than a dozen resolutions under the Congressional Review Act, repealing various federal regulations, including regulations adopted by the Bureau. Moreover, in May 2018, Congress passed, and President Trump signed, the Regulatory Relief Act, which includes a variety of provisions intended to ease the cost of compliance and its related burdens for insured depository institutions. Additionally, proposals to modify existing regulations in light of the new core principles are under consideration by various federal regulatory agencies, including the Bureau. There can be no assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, or that changes in existing regulations will be adopted to implement the new core principles.\nAs a result, the effect of financial services legislation and regulations remains uncertain. The implementation, amendment, or repeal of federal financial services laws or regulations may limit the Bank and its divisions\u2019 business opportunities, impose additional costs on the Company and the Bank, impact the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s revenues or the value of their assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Company or the Bank and its divisions\u2019 businesses.\nChanges to the Small Business Administration\u2019s rules, regulations, and loan products could adversely impact the Bank.\nThe Crestmark division solicits commercial customers that want to utilize the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s commercial lending programs to establish or expand their existing businesses. By their nature, these loans typically fall outside the Bank\u2019s commercial underwriting criteria, either because they are in the \u201cstart-up\u201d phase or because their business plan or business metrics pose challenges that the Bank has traditionally believed to be outside its risk parameters. The economic support provided by the SBA, however, positively affects underwriting scoring, allowing such loans to be originated by the Bank.\nSBA loans do not provide participating banks with blanket guaranties; typically, only a portion of such loans (usually about 75%) are guaranteed. The process to file for the guaranteed funds can be complicated and payments can be significantly delayed; moreover, to the extent the SBA were to review the underlying loan package and raise any issues in connection with the Bank\u2019s documentation of such loans, it could decline the guaranty or require additional paperwork to support the lending decision, which may be costly to prepare. Further, payment on the guaranty may only be claimed after the Bank liquidates the collateral and seeks payment from any loan guarantors. As such, there may be a significant period of time between loan default and realization on the SBA guarantee. See also \u201c--The Crestmark Division generates numerous government-backed loans funded by the Bank, any of which could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors.\u201d\nWhile such loans are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, these programs are subject to Congressional appropriation and could be materially modified either by Congress or by the SBA in connection with its rule-writing authority. To the extent such modifications negatively affect participation or demand in the market for such loans in the future, the Bank could be negatively impacted.\nThe OCC and Federal Reserve are our primary banking regulators, and we may not be able to comply with applicable banking regulations to their satisfaction.\nOur primary regulators have broad discretionary powers to enforce banking laws and regulations and may seek to take informal or formal supervisory action if they deem such actions are necessary or required. If imposed in the future, corrective steps could result in additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, a consent order, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. If imposed, additional resources, both economic and in terms of personnel, would likely need to be dedicated by the Company and the Bank and such regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory capital requirements have increased.\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, minimum requirements have increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules include a new minimum ratio of CET1 Capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 1.8750% for 2018, increasing by 0.0625% per year to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets for 2019 and later years. The rules also impose a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average total assets) of 4% for all banking organizations. The rules emphasize CET1 Capital and implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The minimum total capital ratio remains at 8%, but the general PCA framework has been changed to incorporate these increased minimum requirements. The Basel III Capital Rules phase-in period for smaller, less complex banking organizations, like us and the Bank, began in January 2015. The phase-in has already increased capital requirements for the Company and the Bank, which will be subject to further increasing capital requirements until the phase-in is complete. While the recently passed Regulatory Relief Act requires that federal banking regulators establish a simplified leverage capital framework for smaller banks, the increased regulatory capital requirements could affect our and the Bank's future growth, and if we or the Bank fail to meet such requirements, including of the Basel III Capital Rules (including the application of well-capitalized levels in connection with such rules), we and the Bank would be subject to adverse regulatory action by our regulators, which action could have a material adverse effect on us, the Bank, and our shareholders.\nWe have a concentration of our assets in mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities.\nAs of September 30, 2018, approximately 6.4% of our assets were invested in MBS. Our mortgage-backed and related securities portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government instrumentalities, including those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are in conservatorship. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certificates are modified pass-through MBS that represent undivided interests in underlying pools of fixed-rate, or certain types of adjustable-rate, predominantly single-family and, to a lesser extent, multi-family residential mortgages issued by these U.S. government instrumentalities.\nMBS are subject to credit risk and the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other risks such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of such mortgage loans and affect both the prepayment speed and value of such securities.\nAs of September 30, 2018, approximately 21.9% of the Bank\u2019s assets were invested in municipal securities. Municipal securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment may alter the value of the securities.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is still unknown.\nHundreds of new federal regulations, studies and reports were required under the Dodd-Frank Act. A significant number of them have been finished, but some, including the executive compensation rule, still need to be finalized. Based on the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have already been implemented as well as anticipated regulations, it is likely that banks and thrifts as well as their holding companies will continue to be subject to regulation and compliance obligations that expose us to higher costs as well as noncompliance risk and related regulatory consequences. Given that required regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been adopted, there can be no assurance as to the specific provisions of any such of future regulations or their impact on us or our business, including whether any such future regulations will impose greater restrictions on our business, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe Bureau has reshaped certain consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and such actions have directly impacted the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank, and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Bureau has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of \u201cfederal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof\u201d with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The Bureau is also authorized to prescribe rules, applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\u201cUDAAP authority\u201d). We cannot predict the impact the Bureau\u2019s future actions will have on the banking industry broadly or the Company and the Bank specifically. Notwithstanding that insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or less (such as the Bank) will continue to be supervised and examined by their primary federal regulators, the full reach and impact of the Bureau\u2019s broad rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services are currently unknown. See \u201cBusiness Regulation - Bank Supervision and Regulation\u201d which is included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA less than \u201cSatisfactory\u201d CRA rating could have a negative effect on the OCC\u2019s review of certain banking applications submitted by the Bank.\nUnder the CRA, the Bank is evaluated periodically by the OCC, its primary federal banking regulator, to determine if it is meeting its continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In the Bank\u2019s most recent CRA examination dated January 3, 2017, the Bank received an overall rating of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d If the Bank were to receive a future CRA rating of less than \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d the CRA requires the OCC to take such rating into account in considering an application for any of the following: (i) the establishment of a domestic branch; (ii) the relocation of its main office or of a branch; (iii) the merger or consolidation with or acquisition of assets or assumption of liabilities of an insured depository institution; or (iv) the conversion of the Bank to a national charter. Based upon the NB Election Proposed Rule, CRA ratings will also be considered in determining whether a federal savings bank may to elect treatment as a national bank, although such rule has not yet been finalized as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and could be revised to materially differ from the proposed rule.\nActions taken by the Federal Reserve in connection with national monetary policy could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Federal Reserve is tasked with monitoring domestic economic conditions and national monetary and credit supply. To carry out these responsibilities, the Federal Reserve Board uses numerous monetary tools, including open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. Each of these measures is used in combination in an attempt to positively affect economic conditions in the United States. These actions also directly affect the interest rates charged by U.S. insured depository institutions and have a direct and immediate impact on savings and loan holding companies like us. Any future Federal Reserve actions or policies may have a material adverse effect on us, including with regard to the interest rates we will be able to charge.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings depend substantially on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between (i) the rates we earn on loans, securities, and other earning assets, and (ii) the interest rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. As market interest rates rise, we experience competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits, especially at our community bank, which may decrease our net interest income. Conversely, if interest rates fall, yields on loans and investments may fall. The Bank monitors its interest rate risk exposure; however, the Bank can provide no assurance that its efforts will appropriately protect the Bank in the future from interest rate risk exposure. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nLegal challenges to our, or the Bank\u2019s, operations could have a significant material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time, we, the Bank or our other subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. An adverse resolution in litigation, including litigation or other actions brought by our shareholders, customers or another third party, such as a state attorney general, could result in substantial damages or otherwise negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. See also Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\"\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures, errors, breaches and customer or employee fraud.\nThere have been a number of publicized cases involving errors, fraud, or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improper use of confidential information. Employee fraud, errors, and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and significantly harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to civil claims for negligence.\nAlthough we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of loss from employee or customer fraud or misconduct and employee errors, and although we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate losses that may be attributable to operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, these internal controls may fail to prevent or detect such an occurrence, or such an occurrence and related losses may not be insured or exceed applicable insurance limits.\nIn addition, there have been a number of cases where financial institutions have been the victim of fraud related to unauthorized wire and automated clearinghouse transactions. The facts and circumstances of each case vary but generally involve criminals posing as customers (i.e., stealing bank customers\u2019 identities) to transfer funds out of the institution quickly in an effort to place the funds beyond recovery prior to detection. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers and prevent identity theft, we can provide no assurances that these policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. In addition, our computer systems could be infiltrated by hackers or other intruders. We can provide no assurances that the safeguards we have in place or may implement in the future will prevent all unauthorized infiltrations or breaches. Identity theft, successful unauthorized intrusions, and similar unauthorized conduct could result in reputational damage and financial losses to the Company.\nChanges in technology could be costly.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace. To keep up with our competition, we need to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable us to compete on a cost-effective basis. This is especially true with respect to our MPS division. The cost of such technology, including personnel, has been high in both absolute and relative terms and additional funds continue to be used to enhance existing management information systems. There can be no assurance, given the fast pace of change and innovation, that our technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet our needs, in a timely, cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing new technology into our or the Bank\u2019s operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our operations. Moreover, in connection with our integration of the Crestmark division into the broader operations of the Bank, we may experience significant, one-time or recurring technology-related costs relating to the integration of systems used by the Crestmark division into the Bank\u2019s existing systems. See also \u201c-Acquisitions could disrupt our business and may not be successful.\u201d\nWe are dependent upon relationships with various third parties with respect to the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and our relationships with such third parties, some of which are material to us, including changes in such relationships, could adversely affect our business.\nThe Bank has entered into numerous contracts with third parties with respect to the operations of its business. In some instances, the third parties provide services to the Bank and its divisions; in other instances, the Bank and its divisions provide products and services to such third parties. The Bank has also started offering consumer credit products to the national consumer credit market that are brokered or arranged by third parties. See \"Risks Related to Marketing Program Agreements.\" If any such agreements are not renewed by the third party, if such agreements are renewed on terms less favorable to the Bank, or if such agreements are found to be illegal or in need of material restructuring to comply with applicable law or regulation, such actions could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, its divisions and, ultimately, the Company. For example, in July 2017, the Bank announced that it would not be providing interest-free Refund Advance loans for H&R Block tax preparation customers during the 2018 tax season. The Company\u2019s relationship with H&R Block represented approximately $12.0 million in net earnings during fiscal year 2017. Given the loss of this relationship, the Company recognized a total impairment charge of $10.2 million, which was expensed during the 2017 fiscal fourth quarter.\nIn addition, if any of our counterparties is unable to meet its obligations to us for any reason (including but not limited to bankruptcy, computer or other technological interruptions or failures, personnel loss, negative regulatory actions, or acts of God), we may need to seek alternative service providers, or discontinue certain products or programs in their entirety. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, situations where we have been held directly or indirectly responsible, or were otherwise subject to liability, for actions of our third party vendors undertaken on behalf of the Bank or for the inability of our vendors to perform services for our customers on a timely basis or at all. Any such responsibility or liability in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and financial results.\nTo the extent any agreement with a service provider is terminated, we may not be able to secure alternate service providers, and, even if we do, the terms with alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place. In addition, were we to lose any of our significant third-party providers, it could cause a material disruption in our ability to service our customers, which also could have an adverse material impact on the Bank, its divisions and, ultimately, the Company. Moreover, significant disruptions in our ability to provide services could negatively affect the perception of our business, which could result in a loss of confidence and other adverse effects on our business.\nFurther, our agreements with third-party vendors could come under scrutiny by our regulators. If a regulator should raise an issue with, or object to, any term or provision in such an agreement or any action taken by such third party vis-\u00e0-vis the Bank\u2019s operations or customers, this could result in a material adverse effect to the Company including, but not limited to, the imposition of fines and/or penalties and the termination of such agreement. Moreover, if our regulators examine our third party service providers and find questionable or illegal acts or practices, our regulators could require us to restructure or terminate our agreements with such providers.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nWe encounter significant competition in all of our market areas from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas. The Bank's divisions operate on a national scale against competitors with substantially greater resources. The success of the Bank's divisions depends upon our, the Bank\u2019s and the divisions' ability to compete in their various business markets.\nSeveral banking institutions have adopted business strategies that are similar to ours, particularly with respect to the MPS division. As a consequence, we have encountered competition in this area and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. This competition may increase our costs, reduce our revenues or revenue growth, or make it difficult for us to compete effectively in obtaining additional customer relationships. With respect to the Crestmark division, we are also subject to additional competitive market factors. See \u201cRisks Related to the Bank\u2019s Divisions\u201d for additional risks related to the Crestmark division.\nThe Bank relies on brokered deposits to assist in funding its loan and other financing products; accordingly, any change in the Bank\u2019s ability to gather brokered deposits may adversely impact the Bank.\nA substantial portion of our deposit liabilities are classified as brokered deposits, and failure to maintain the Bank's status as a \"well-capitalized\" institution could have an adverse effect on us, and our ability to fund our operations.\nBased on published FDIC guidance, as of September 30, 2018, the Bank classified $2.21 billion, or 49.9%, of its deposit liabilities as brokered deposits. Due to the Bank\u2019s current status as a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution under the FDIC\u2019s prompt corrective action regulations, management believes that this categorization of a segment of its deposits does not pose a risk to the Bank. However, should the Bank ever fail to be well-capitalized in the future as a result of not meeting the well-capitalized requirements or the imposition of an individual minimum capital requirement or similar formal requirement, then, the Bank would be prohibited, absent waiver from the FDIC, from utilizing brokered deposits (i.e., no insured depository institution that is deemed to be less than \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d may accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC). In such event, unless the Bank were to receive a suitable waiver from the FDIC, such a result could produce material adverse consequences for the Bank with respect to liquidity and could also have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, and in general, depending on the Bank\u2019s condition in the future, the FDIC could increase the surcharge on our brokered deposits up to 30 basis points. For the year ended September 30, 2018, we estimate that the additional surcharge attributable to the Bank\u2019s brokered deposits was approximately $0.5 million, after tax. If we are required to amend previous call reports with respect to our level of brokered deposits or we are ever required to pay higher surcharge assessments with respect to these deposits, such payments could be material and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, including as a result of negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, illegal or unauthorized acts taken by third parties that supply products or services to the Company or the Bank, and ethical behavior of our employees. Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and, particularly with respect to our MPS division, could result in the imposition of new regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Any such damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts that we generate through MPS\u2019 customer relationships, of which four are particularly significant to our operations.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts we generate through program manager relationships between third parties and MPS. Deposits related to our top four program managers (each, a significant program manager) totaled $1.38 billion at September 30, 2018. We provide oversight and auditing of such third-party relationships and all such relationships must meet all internal and regulatory requirements. We may exit these relationships if such requirements are not met or if required to do so by our regulators. We perform liquidity reporting and planning daily and identify and monitor contingent sources of liquidity, such as national CDs, fed fund lines or public fund CDs. If one of these significant program manager relationships were to be terminated, it could materially reduce our deposits, assets and income. Similarly, if a significant program manager was not replaced, we may be required to seek higher-rate funding sources as compared to the existing program manager, and interest expense might increase.\nThe student loan portfolio purchases present risks to the Bank.\nThe Bank purchased two separate student loan portfolios; the first in fiscal year 2017 and the second at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. The first portfolio included seasoned loans that were taken by medical school students who enrolled in non-U.S. medical schools and the second included more traditional loans made to higher education students. The servicing of these loans is done through a third-party. When the portfolios were purchased, they were insured by ReliaMax Surety Company (\"RSC\"); however, the South Dakota Division of Insurance placed RSC into liquidation in June 2018. As a result of the liquidation proceedings, the Bank's purchased student loan portfolios are no longer insured. Due to the cancellation of the insurance coverage with respect to the purchased student loan portfolios, we adjusted the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to the purchased student loan portfolios to $2.8 million at September 30, 2018, and we expect to recognize additional ongoing provision expense on the purchased student loan portfolios until recovery of unearned premiums is collected. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether or to what extent we will be able to recover all or any portion of unearned premiums relating to the Bank's purchased student loan portfolios, whether as a result of the RSC liquidation plan, the New York Property/Casualty Insurance Security Fund, or otherwise. If our recovery of unearned premiums is less than expected (including if we do not recover any such amounts at all), we may recognize loan losses in the future in excess of our estimates, which may adversely affect our realized pre-tax yields on the Bank's purchased student loan portfolios and may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA data security breach involving us, the Bank or any of our business vendors, marketers, or partners could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nIn connection with our businesses, we collect and retain significant volumes of personally identifiable information, including social security numbers of our customers and other personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. Our vendors, marketers, or partners may experience security breaches involving the receipt, transmission, and storage of confidential customer and other personally identifiable information; alternatively, we may directly experience such a security breach. Such security breaches could include account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, or other malicious code, cyberattacks, or other events. These threats may arise from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or from accidental technological failure. If one or more of these events occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential customer information, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, additional costs (such as costs for repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties, and financial losses for both us and our clients and customers. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, as well as the operations of our clients, customers, or other third parties with which we engage in business. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats and also due to the expanding use of technology-based products and services by us and our customers. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses related to a security breach in the future, and any such losses may be material.\nThe continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the serious threats faced by financial institutions globally with respect to information security. Our customers and employees, and those of our tax preparation and loan marketing partners, expect that we and our partners will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. Improper access to or use of our or the tax preparation partners' or loan marketing partners' systems or databases could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification of confidential customer and other information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. In addition, a data security breach at the tax preparation or loan marketing partners could result in significant reputational harm to us and cause the use and acceptance of our tax-related products and loan marketing-related products and services to decline, either of which could have an adverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects.\nIn March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution\u2019s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Bank or its divisions fail to observe this regulatory guidance, the Bank could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and may not be successful.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we have expanded our business in part through acquisitions. Since December 2014, we have completed the acquisition of substantially all of the commercial loan portfolio and related assets of AFS/IBEX Financial Services, Inc., and completed the acquisition of the assets of Fort Knox Financial Services Corporation and its subsidiary, Tax Products Services LLC, in September 2015. In addition, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of EPS Financial in November 2016 and completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of SCS in December 2016. More recently, as discussed above, we completed the Crestmark Acquisition on August 1, 2018.\nIn addition to the transactions noted above, we may engage in additional acquisitions in the future that we believe provide a strategic or geographic fit with our business. We cannot predict if or when we may enter into any such acquisition, or the nature or terms of any such acquisition. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage this growth or that such acquired businesses will be integrated into our existing businesses as efficiently or in a timely manner as we may anticipate. Acquiring other businesses will generally involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nincreased capital needs;\n\u2022\nincreased and new regulatory and compliance requirements;\n\u2022\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies with respect to the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business to acquisition-integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of the acquired business\u2019s users and customers onto our systems;\n\u2022\nretention of employees from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nintegration of employees from the acquired business into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, information management, human resources and other administrative systems and operations with ours;\n\u2022\npotential liability for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes and tax and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential increased litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired business, including claims brought by regulators, terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, vendors, or other third parties; and\n\u2022\npotential goodwill impairment.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired business or technology, or otherwise address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Unanticipated costs, delays, regulatory review and examination, or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired business with our company may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our technology and compliance systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions. Failures or difficulties in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire, including their personnel, technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments are often speculative in nature and the actual benefits we derive from them could be lower or take longer to materialize than we expect.\nTo the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, any such payment would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other business purposes. Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or impairment charges against goodwill on our balance sheet, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders.\nFor more information regarding risks related to the Crestmark Acquisition, see \u201cRisks Related to the Bank\u2019s Divisions.\u201d\nAn impairment charge of goodwill or other intangibles could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have recently experienced significant growth, in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets are included within our consolidated assets. Our goodwill and intangible assets were $374.0 million as of September 30, 2018. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including sustained decline in a reporting unit\u2019s fair value, legal and regulatory factors, operating performance indicators, competition and other factors. GAAP requires us to assign and then test goodwill at the reporting unit level. If over a sustained period of time we experience a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization, which may serve as an estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit, this may be an indication of impairment. If the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its net book value, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. In addition, if the revenue and cash flows generated from any of our other intangible assets is not sufficient to support its net book value, we may be required to record an impairment charge. For example, in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, we recognized a $10.2 million intangible impairment charge related to the non-renewal of the H&R Block relationship. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new financial products or services within existing lines of business. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with developing and marketing new lines of business or new products or services, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed, and we may be required to invest significant time and management and capital resources in connection with such new lines of business or new products or services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or services may not be achieved. In addition, price and profitability targets for new lines of business or new products or services may not prove feasible, as we, the Bank or any of the Bank's divisions may need to price products and services on less advantageous terms than anticipated to retain or attract clients. External factors, such as regulatory reception, compliance with regulations and guidance, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service may be expensive to implement and could also have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses.\nThe Bank owns or is seeking a number of patents, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property with respect to the operation of its business and the protection of such intellectual property may in the future require material expenditures.\nOur divisions, through the Bank, seek protection for various forms of intellectual property from time to time. No assurance can be given that such protection will be granted. In addition, given the competitive market environment of its business, the Bank must be vigilant in ensuring that its patents and other intellectual property are protected and not exploited by unlicensed third parties.\nThe Bank must also protect itself and defend against intellectual property challenges initiated by third parties making various claims against it. With respect to these claims, regardless of whether we are pursuing our claims against perceived infringers or defending our intellectual property from third parties asserting various claims of infringement, it is possible that significant personnel time and monetary resources could be used to pursue or defend such claims.\nIntellectual property risks extend to foreign countries whose protections of such property are not as extensive as those in the United States. As such, the Bank may need to spend additional sums to ensure that its intellectual property protections are maximized globally. Moreover, should there be a material, improper use of the Bank\u2019s intellectual property, this could have an adverse impact on our divisions' operations and the Bank.\nThe OCC\u2019s new \u201cfintech\u201d charter could present a market risk to the Company generally and the MPS division specifically.\nThe OCC announced on July 31, 2018 that it would begin to accept and evaluate charters for entities that wanted to conduct certain components of a banking business pursuant to a federal charter, known as a \u201cspecial purpose national bank\u201d (\u201cSPNB\u201d) charter. Intended to promote economic opportunity and spur financial innovation, SPNBs may engage in any of the following activities: paying checks, lending money or taking deposits. In order to obtain an SPNB charter, applicants will have to consider capital, liquidity, and financial inclusion in their application materials. Initially, these entities will be subject to heightened OCC supervision. The Superintendent of the State of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services has filed suit against the OCC in connection with the availability of such charter option, alleging, among other points, that SPNBs are unconstitutional and will harm consumers. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors has also filed a similar suit against the OCC.\nAs of the date of this filing, the OCC has not announced approval of any applications for an SPNB charter, although it has publicly stated that applications have been filed. If any such applications are granted, recipients of an SPNB charter may enter the U.S. payments market in which the Bank operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Payments division.\nExisting insurance policies may not adequately protect the Company and its subsidiaries.\nFidelity, business interruption, cybersecurity, and property insurance policies are in place with respect to the operations of the Company. Should any event triggering such policies occur, however, it is possible that our policies would not fully reimburse us for the losses we could sustain due to deductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits, or other factors. We generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits, increase the deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team or key employees in the Bank's divisions, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior executive management team. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and operating personnel. On October 30, 2018, we announced that J. Tyler Haahr had stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and that Brad Hanson, President of the Company and the Bank, would assume the additional role of Chief Executive Officer. This, and any other management transition in the future, may create uncertainty and involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, as we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with different skills and experiences, with a sound understanding of our business and the industries in which we operate. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nIf we foreclose on and take ownership of real estate collateral property, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues.\nWe may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property. In such case, we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) supply of and demand for rental units or properties; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts of God.\nAdditionally, hazardous substances may be discovered on such foreclosed real estate. In this event, we could be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at our own cost and expense. The cost of removal and environmental remediation could be substantial. We may not have adequate remedies against the owners of the properties or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties.\nExpenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Therefore, the cost of operating a real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, if any, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment or may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nOur agricultural loans are subject to factors beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe agricultural industry is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in our market area. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within our agricultural loan portfolios.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nWe have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies, as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Further, risk mitigation techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specific circumstances and timing of such outcomes, which may result in the Bank or any of its divisions incurring losses.\nFor example, the 2008 financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance, and limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, those that set accounting standards and those that interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, banking regulators, and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently and retroactively, which may result in us being required to restate prior period financial statements, which restatements may reflect material changes. For example, the FASB issued a rule in 2016 requiring companies to estimate current expected credit losses. The rule, which is a major change for banking organizations, becomes effective for the Company on October 1, 2020. The new standard is likely to result in more timely recognition of credit losses than under the previous incurred loss model, and we are evaluating the extent to which the new rule will affect our results of operations.\nCatastrophic events could occur and impact our operations or the operations of our vendors or other third parties with which we do business.\nCatastrophic events (including those that are weather related, as well as those that are geopolitical related) could have an adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s ability and the ability of our vendors and other third parties with which we do business, to provide necessary services to support the operation of the Bank and provide products and services to the Bank\u2019s customers. These events, which are beyond our control, could be short-term in nature or longer term, lasting for significant periods of time. Although insurance coverage may provide some protection in light of such events, it cannot be determined whether insurance proceeds would adequately compensate the Bank for the losses it incurred as a result of such events. See also \u201c--Existing insurance policies may not adequately protect the Company and its subsidiaries.\u201d Moreover, the damage caused by such events may not be directly compensable from insurance proceeds or otherwise, such as damage to our reputation as a result of such events.\nRisks Related to the Bank's Divisions\nThe Bureau's Prepaid Accounts Rule impacts the Bank\u2019s offering of prepaid cards.\nAs described above, the Bureau issued a final rule on October 5, 2016, which supplemented the existing regulatory framework pursuant to which prepaid products (both cards and other delivery methods, including codes) are offered and serviced. The Prepaid Accounts Rule brought prepaid products fully within Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and, for prepaid products that have a \u201ccredit\u201d component, within Regulation Z, which implements the federal Truth in Lending Act. The Prepaid Accounts Rule created tailored provisions which (i) created a definition for a \u201cprepaid account\u201d in Regulation E, (ii) required certain disclosures to consumers before such consumer acquires a prepaid card account, (iii) extended Regulation E\u2019s limited liability and error resolution provisions to certain registered prepaid accounts, (iv) regulated the provision of billing statements, and (v) extended Regulation Z\u2019s credit card rules and disclosure requirements to prepaid accounts that provide overdraft services and other credit features (the Bank currently issues a card with an overdraft feature that is marketed by a third party program manager.) The Prepaid Accounts Rule also requires account issuers to post their publicly offered prepaid card program agreements on their own websites and make them available to consumers upon request and to provide copies of all publicly offered prepaid card program agreements to the Bureau. The Prepaid Accounts Rule became effective on October 1, 2017, although the general effective date for compliance has been extended by the Bureau to April 1, 2019. Compliance with the Prepaid Accounts Rule has resulted in additional costs which we expect to continue to grow.\nPrepaid card issuers like the Bank are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny based on AML and Bank Secrecy Act concerns.\nThere is a concern within the bank regulatory environment over the use of credit and, in particular, prepaid cards as a means by which to illegally launder and move money. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued rules related to providers of \u201cprepaid access\u201d which have left certain issues unresolved related to its regulatory requirements. It is likely that any changes to the regulatory environment related to the offering of prepaid cards will increase the Bank\u2019s compliance and operational costs. Although the Bank will continue to work with its regulators to provide information about its operations as well as the state of the prepaid card industry, we believe such concerns in general will continue for the foreseeable future for the entire banking industry, with a continued emphasis on heightened compliance expectations, resulting in higher compliance costs. See Part I, Item 1\u201cBusiness Regulation - Bank Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur tax refund-related business is concentrated in a limited number of partners, and our success will depend upon the\nmaintenance of those agreements.\nIf any of our relationships with the companies through which we offer tax refund-related products to consumers and commercial entities were to significantly decrease, such a decrease would likely have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition. For example, the Bank\u2019s agreement with Jackson Hewitt Tax Service extends through the 2020 tax season, but the loss of this relationship prior to such time for a contractual or other reason would have a materially adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s results of operation.\nTax advance loans represent a significant credit risk, and if we are unable to collect a significant portion of the tax refund advances, it would materially negatively impact earnings.\nThere is a credit risk associated with a tax refund advance because the funds are disbursed to the customer prior to the Company receiving the customer\u2019s refund from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Because there is no recourse to the customer if the tax refund advance is not paid in full with the proceeds of the customer\u2019s tax refund, we may not collect all of our payments related to the tax refund advances from the IRS and state revenue departments. Losses will generally occur on tax refund advances when we do not receive payment from the IRS or state revenue department due to a number of reasons, such as IRS revenue protection strategies including audits of returns, errors in the tax return, tax return fraud, and tax debts not previously disclosed to us during our underwriting process. Although our underwriting takes these factors into consideration during the tax refund advance approval process, if the IRS significantly alters its revenue protection strategies for a given tax season, or we are incorrect in our underwriting assumptions, we could experience higher loan loss provisions above those projected. In addition, a consumer could exercise its rights and withdraw its ACH authorization provided in connection with a tax refund advance, meaning the Bank could no longer collect the payments related to the tax refund advances via a direct debit to the customer\u2019s designated bank account, which could result in additional losses. For the tax season refund advance activity incurred in fiscal 2018, the Bank recorded $21.3 million in net charge-offs related to tax refund advances through September 30, 2018.\nOur network of tax preparation partners is extensive, but it may be difficult to manage and retain such marketing partners because of competitive market forces.\nAs of the date of this filing, the Bank has a network of over 10,000 active EROs that utilize the Bank\u2019s services, and it is expected that this number will increase for the 2018 tax season. Although each ERO undergoes an analysis of its operations prior to marketing the Bank\u2019s products, it is possible that certain EROs will facilitate or engage in tax-related malfeasance or offer the Bank's products and services in a manner that does not comply with law or contractual representations, warranties, and covenants. In addition, it is possible that EROs may choose to offer the tax-related products of other companies that provide products and services similar to the Bank\u2019s for pricing or other competitive reasons. Any of these events, were they to occur in the future, could result in material adverse consequences to us.\nAgency, technological, or human error could lead to tax refund processing delays, which could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nWe and our tax preparation partners rely on the IRS, technology, and employees when processing and preparing tax refunds and tax-related products and services. Any delays during the processing or preparation period could result in reputational damage to us or to our tax preparation partners, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and tax-related products and services, either of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects. An IRS delay in processing tax returns in any given tax season could result in a smaller percentage of expected revenues flowing into our third fiscal quarter following such tax season.\nChanges in laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations, applicable to our tax refund-related services could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our total operating revenues and earnings from tax refund processing and settlement services. The tax preparation industry is highly regulated under a variety of statutes and regulations, all of which are subject to change, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the way we conduct or expand our tax refund processing and related services. Any new requirements or rules, changes in such requirements or rules, new interpretations of existing requirements or rules, failure to follow requirements or rules, or future lawsuits or rulings could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems redevelopment, render our products or services less profitable or obsolete or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, changes in the U.S. tax laws as a result of pending tax legislation in the U.S. Congress or otherwise may adversely impact our tax refund processing and settlement business, and such damage could reduce customer demand for our strategic partner\u2019s refund advance products, thereby reducing the volume of refund advance loans that we may offer.\nFraud and other illegal activity involving our tax preparation partners or products could lead to a regulatory investigation and reputational damage to us, reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and reload network, reduce the use of our services, and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nCriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving prepaid cards, reload products, and tax refunds. Illegal activities involving such products and services include malicious social engineering schemes, where people are asked to provide a prepaid card or reload product in order to obtain a loan or purchase goods or services. Illegal activities may also include fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. We rely upon third party tax preparers for tax preparation and other services, which subjects us to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. Even a single significant instance of fraud could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services, cause retail distributors or their customers to cease doing business with us or them, or could lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Bureau's final rule related to certain small dollar loans will impact certain processes used by the Bank and could materially impact the Bank\u2019s ability to grow certain aspects of the Payments division.\nOn October 5, 2017, the Bureau issued its final rule related to certain small dollar loans. Affecting primarily shorter term (e.g., 45 days or less) loans with an Annual Percentage Rate of 36% or more, the rule generally requires a provider of such loans to determine the consumer borrower\u2019s ability to repay; an alternative to the ability-to-repay determination is provided for loans that do not exceed $500 and meet certain other requirements.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Bureau also imposes certain requirements related to the collection of longer-term loans with an Annual Percentage Rate of 36% or more; specifically, the final rule requires that, where the creditor (like the Bank) has access to the consumer\u2019s bank account for repayment of the loan proceeds, the creditor must provide certain notices to the consumer about upcoming payments and transactions via model forms the Bureau also published. In addition, a creditor is prohibited from attempting to withdraw payment from a consumer\u2019s bank account where such repayment has been declined for two consecutive payment attempts. At such time, the creditor is required to get a new, specific authorization from the consumer to debit the bank account. Implementation of these requirements for these types of products may negatively impact products and services that we could offer either directly or in connection with a third-party loan marketer.\nThis rule is scheduled to become effective in August 2019, although the Bureau stated that it will publish proposed revisions to the \u201cability to repay\u201d components of the rule in January 2019. In response to this, in early November 2018, a U.S. federal judge in Texas stayed compliance with the regulation until such time as he determines to lift the stay, which likely will not be before March 2019 when the parties provide further reports to the judge. As such, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the impact of this regulation on the Bank and the parties with which it markets loans that would otherwise be subject to the final rule\u2019s requirements as originally published cannot be determined.\nPremium financing activity may result in increased exposure to credit risk and fraud.\nWe acquired the premium finance loan portfolio and related assets of AFS/IBEX Financial Services, Inc. in December 2014 and continue, through that platform, to serve businesses and insurance agencies nationwide with commercial insurance premium financing products. We rely on insurance agents and brokers to produce these commercial loans, which are made to borrowers who borrow funds to pay premiums on property and casualty insurance policies. Typically, the financing arrangement with the borrower provides for periodic payments to the lender to secure the insurance policy with an insurer, and the lender is entitled to any unearned premium due from the insurer in the event of policy cancellation, with any excess returned to the insured/borrower after the loan has been paid off. The financing arrangement typically includes a limited power of attorney to permit the lender to cancel the insurance policy in the event of default. Typically, premium finance loans are designed to amortize faster than the unearned premium that has been paid, either as a down payment, or periodically is earned, so that the value of the unearned premium exceeds the outstanding financed amount, providing collateral to the lender. If the borrower fails to pay on the premium finance loan, then the financed insurance policy must be cancelled to avoid losses with respect to unearned premiums. We must consider both the creditworthiness of the borrower as well as the creditworthiness of the insurer (for the ability to return the unearned premium). There is also an operational risk of assuring that the insurance policy is cancelled on a timely basis to prevent unearned premium from dissipating once the policy can be cancelled. Further, since we are not involved in the marketing of the loans, we are therefore exposed to the risk of fraud by third-party marketers.\nCosts of conforming products and services to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the \u201cPCI DSS\u201d) are costly and could continue to affect the operations of MPS.\nThe PCI DSS is a multifaceted standard that includes data security management, policies and procedures as well as other protective measures, that was created by the largest credit card associations in the world in an effort to protect the nonpublic personal information of all types of cardholders, including prepaid cardholders and holders of network branded credit cards (such as Discover, MasterCard and Visa). The PCI DSS mandates a prescribed technical foundation for the collection, storage and transmission of cardholder data and also contains significant provisions regarding the testing of security protections by various entities in the payment card industry, including MPS. Compliance with the PCI DSS is costly and changes to the standards could have an equal, or greater, effect on profitability of the relevant business division.\nThe potential for fraud in the card payment industry is significant.\nIssuers of prepaid and credit cards have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of cardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain. The theft of such information is regularly reported and affects not only individuals but businesses as well. Many types of credit card fraud exist, including the counterfeiting of cards and \u201cskimming\u201d (whereby a skimmer reads a debit card's encoded mag stripe and a camera records the PIN that is entered by a customer). It is estimated that global losses from ATM skimming alone are over $2.0 billion annually. Losses from fraud have been substantial for certain card industry participants. Such fraudulent activity could adversely impact us in the future, notwithstanding our recent introduction of EMV (i.e., chip-enabled) cards and the broader acceptance of such cards in the U.S. and international markets.\nAdditionally, new frauds, including those perpetrated by Wi-Fi scanners and the cracking of encryption software, are also being perpetrated against global banks and their customers. The Bank continues to monitor these developments and has a program in place to monitor for debit and credit card fraud. Even with such policies and procedures in place and although fraud has not had a material impact on the profitability of the Bank, there can be no assurance that the Bank, its customers or the ATM networks or card payment industry in which it participates will not be the victims of a fraud.\nThe threat of fraud in the industry also includes the possibility that there is collusion between certain participants in the card system to act illegally. Although MPS is not aware of any instances to date, it is possible that such activities could occur in the future, thereby adversely impacting our operations and profitability.\nCompetition in the card industry is significant. In order to maintain an edge to its products and offerings, MPS must invest significantly in technology and research and development.\nThe heavy emphasis upon technology in the products and services offered by MPS requires significant expenditures with respect to research and development, both to exploit technological gains and to develop new products and services to meet customers\u2019 needs. While some efforts may yield substantial benefits for the division, others will not, thereby resulting in expenditures for which profits will not be realized. MPS is not able to predict with any degree of certainty the level of research and development that will be required in the future, how much those efforts will cost, or how profitable such developments will be for the division if and when undertaken.\nOur business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards or there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons. For example, negative publicity surrounding the Company or other prepaid financial service providers could impact MPS\u2019s business and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid financial services. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, MPS\u2019s operating revenues may remain at current levels or decline. Growth of prepaid financial services as an electronic payment mechanism may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If there is a shift in the mix of payment forms used by consumers (i.e., cash, credit cards, traditional debit cards and prepaid cards) away from products and services offered by MPS, such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDiscover, MasterCard and Visa, as well as other electronic funds networks in which MPS operates, could change their rules.\nPursuant to the agreements between MPS and Discover, MasterCard, Visa and other card networks, these third parties typically retain the right to prescribe certain business practices and procedures with respect to parties such as MPS. Such prescribed terms include, but are not limited to, a contracting party\u2019s level of capital as well as other business requirements.\nDiscover, MasterCard and Visa also retain the right in their agreements with industry participants such as MPS to unilaterally change the rules under which such transactions are processed with little or no advance warning. This power includes the power to prevent MPS from accessing their networks in order to process transactions as well as the power to revise, replace or alter existing card interchange rates and rules. Should any third party choose to invoke this right unilaterally, such changes could materially impact the operations of MPS and, if MPS is unable to comply with such rules, such third-party card networks could terminate their relationships with MPS.\nOur business is generally heavily dependent upon the Internet, and any negative disruptions to its operation could negatively impact our business, including MPS in particular.\nMuch of our business, especially at the divisional level, depends upon transactions being processed through the Internet. Like nearly all other commercial enterprises, we rely upon others to provide the Internet so that commerce can be conducted. Were there to be a failure in the operation of the Internet or a significant impairment in our ability to move information on the Internet or our ability to do so in accordance with customer safeguard protocols, we would need to develop alternative processes during which time revenues and profitability may be lower, and there can be no assurance that we could develop or find such an alternative on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOur ability to process transactions requires functioning communication and electricity lines.\nThe nature of the banking industry in general, and the credit card and debit card industry in particular, is that it must be operational every day of the week and every hour of the day. Any disruption in the utilities utilized by the Bank or its divisions could have a negative effect on our operations, result in negative publicity, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nData encryption technology has not been perfected and vigilance in MPS\u2019 information technology systems is costly.\nThe Bank and its divisions hold sensitive business and personal information with respect to the products and services they offer. This information, which is generally digitally encrypted, is passed along various technology channels, including the Internet. Although we encrypt customer and other sensitive information and expend significant financial and personnel resources to maintain the integrity of our technology networks and the confidentiality of nonpublic customer information, because such information may travel on public technology and other non-secure channels, the confidential information is potentially susceptible to hacking and other illegal intrusions. Were such a security breach to occur, the provision of products and services to our customers would be impaired. In addition, were a breach to occur, we could incur significant fines from the electronic funds associations involved, or from federal and/or state regulators and could be subject to other prohibitions, as well as extensive litigation from commercial parties and consumers affected by such breach. Such actions would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnclaimed funds represented by unused value on the cards presents compliance and other risks.\nThe concept of escheatment involves the reporting and delivery of property to states that is abandoned when its rightful owner cannot be readily located and/or identified. In the context of prepaid cards, the funds in connection with such cards can sometimes be \u201cabandoned\u201d or unused for the relevant period of time set forth in each applicable state\u2019s abandoned property laws. MPS utilizes automated programs to ensure its operations are compliant with such applicable laws and regulations. There appears, however, to be a movement among some state regulators to more broadly interpret definitions in escheatment statutes and regulations than in the past. State regulators may choose to initiate collection or other litigation action against prepaid card issuers, like MPS, for unreported abandoned property, and such actions may seek to assess fines and penalties.\nMPS's revenue is concentrated.\nMPS works with a large number of business partners to derive its revenue. The Company believes four of its partners have reached a size that, should these partners\u2019 business with the Company end or there is a significant decrease in revenues associated with any of these business relationships, the earnings attributable to them would have a material effect on the financial results of the Company.\nThe composition of Crestmark\u2019s customer base presents unique market risks and opportunities.\nThe Crestmark division specializes in providing business-to-business working capital solutions, equipment leasing, and asset-based lending services to small- and medium-sized businesses that are outside the scope of what traditional banks typically offer. These services include customizable business lines of credit, machinery and equipment financing, term loans, working capital acquisition funding and expansion financing, discount factoring, and traditional factoring. Prior to the Crestmark Acquisition, Crestmark typically provided these services to customers who were not \u201cbankable\u201d under traditional lending standards, and the loans it made were based in large part on the value of and control over the borrower\u2019s collateral. The Bank continues to refine the underwriting and credit assessments of the Crestmark\u2019s divisions customers in connection with the loans and financing opportunities the division is creating for the Bank. Additionally, due to the smaller size of the Crestmark division\u2019s commercial customers, such customers are more likely than larger commercial businesses to be strained by regional or national economic downturns. Stressed economic conditions may reduce the ability of the Crestmark division\u2019s commercial borrowers to make loan and lease payments or cause the value of the Bank\u2019s collateral to decline. The effect of a downturn in general economic conditions may be more significant for the Crestmark division\u2019s business than for the Bank as a whole due to the specialized nature of its financial products and collateral.\nMoreover, given the relatively smaller nature of the Crestmark division\u2019s customers, it is difficult to verify the accuracy and reliability of customer financial and other underwriting materials. If materials provided to the Crestmark division by commercial credit applicants are materially inaccurate or false, or if the third-party resources the Crestmark division uses to underwrite credit applicants do not identify risks presented by such potential customer relationships, the Bank could suffer significant material consequences in connection with the performance of its commercial loan portfolio, its earnings, and its reputation and may need to dedicate resources to ensure the division\u2019s ability to identify such fraud in the future.\nCrestmark\u2019s business presents a heightened degree of operational and credit risks to the Bank.\nCrestmark\u2019s focus on asset-based loans and other forms of commercial financing subjects Crestmark, and therefore the Bank, to the potential for fraud by borrowers regarding the value of underlying collateral. As a result, the Bank may assume different or greater lending risks than other commercial lenders in connection with the commercial products and services offered through the Crestmark division. Even routine funding transactions expose the Bank to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, credit risk related to products and services offered by the Crestmark division may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount due under the financial instrument.\nFuture success of the Crestmark division is dependent on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive commercial finance industry.\nThe Crestmark division faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors, and its future growth and success depends on its ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. The Crestmark division competes for loans, leases, and other financial services with numerous national and regional banks, thrifts, credit unions, and other financial institutions, as well as other entities that provide financial services, including specialty lenders, securities firms, and mutual funds. Certain larger commercial financing companies do not currently focus their marketing efforts on smaller commercial companies; however, any shift in focus by such larger financing companies may further fragment existing market share in this commercial finance industry. Moreover, some of the financial institutions and financial service organizations with which the Crestmark division competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as the Crestmark division and the Bank. Many of the Crestmark division\u2019s competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, offer larger branch networks than the Bank does, and may offer other services that neither the Crestmark division nor the Bank do. This competition may limit the Crestmark division\u2019s growth or earnings.\nThe Crestmark division generates government-backed loans funded by the Bank, any of which could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors.\nPrior to its acquisition, the Crestmark division originated loans backed by numerous state and federal government agencies. Risks inherent in the Bank\u2019s participation in such programs, through its Crestmark division, include: (i) some of these programs guarantee only a portion of the commercial loan made by the Bank; as such, if the borrower defaults and losses exceed those guaranteed by the government agency, the Bank could realize significant losses; (ii) certain programs, including some guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture, limit the geographic scope of such loans; as such, if the Crestmark division is not able to market these loans to potential borrowers, the Bank\u2019s share in this market may be negatively impacted; (iii) the intended beneficiaries of such loan programs may experience a contraction in their credit quality due to local, national, or global economic events or because of factors specific to their business, including, for example, businesses dependent upon the farming and agriculture industry; as such, any negative impact to certain commercial business lines designed to benefit from such government-sponsored loan programs could constrict the Bank\u2019s business in these areas; and (iv) nearly all of these guaranteed loan programs are subject to an appropriations process, either at the legislative or regulatory level; this means that funds that may be currently available to guarantee loans or portions of loans could be limited or eliminated in their entirety with little or no advance warning.\nThrough our Crestmark division, we engage in equipment leasing activities; the residual value of leased equipment at the time of its disposition may be less than forecasted at the time we entered into the lease.\nThe market value of any given piece of leased equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold due to various factors, including factors beyond our control. The market value of used leased equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price for new equipment that is similar;\n\u2022\nthe age and condition of the leased equipment at the time it is sold;\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for similar used equipment on the market;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances relating to the leased equipment or similar equipment; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the specific business or industry in which the equipment is used, as well as broader regional or national economic conditions.\nWe include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of leased equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of leased equipment. If we sell our used leased equipment at prices significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipated at the time we entered into the lease, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Marketing Program Agreements\nProgram agreements that the Bank has entered into, and expects to enter into from time to time in the future, with third parties to market and service consumer loans originated by the Bank may subject the Bank to claims from regulatory agencies and other third parties that, if successful, could negatively impact the Bank\u2019s current and future business.\nThe Bank has entered into various agreements with unaffiliated third parties (\u201cMarketers\u201d), whereby the Marketers will market and service unsecured consumer loans underwritten and originated by the Bank. We expect the Bank to enter into additional similar program agreements with other third parties to market and service loans originated by the Bank, from time to time in the future. Certain types of these arrangements have been challenged both in the courts and in regulatory actions. In these actions, plaintiffs have generally argued that the \u201ctrue lender\u201d is the marketer and that the intent of such lending program is to evade state usury and loan licensing laws. Other cases have also included other claims, including racketeering and other state law claims, in their challenge of such programs. There can be no assurance that lawsuits or regulatory actions in connection with any such lending programs the Bank enters into will not be brought in the future. If a regulatory agency, consumer advocate group, or other third party were to bring an action against the Bank or any of the third parties with which the Bank operates such lending programs, and such actions were successful, such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nAgreements with Marketers, whereby the Bank will originate and hold unsecured consumer loans, may result in increased exposure to credit risk and fraud and may present certain additional risks.\nAlthough the Bank has historically offered unsecured consumer loans to its customers through its brick-and-mortar branch network, the Bank\u2019s entry into program agreements with other third parties to market and service loans originated by the Bank, such as its program agreement with Liberty Lending, LLC, represents a new area of the consumer credit market for the Bank, which presents potential increased credit, operational, and reputational risks. Because the loans originated under such programs are unsecured, in the event a borrower does not repay the loan in accordance with its terms or otherwise defaults on the loan, the Bank may not be able to recover from the borrower an amount sufficient to pay any remaining balance on the loan. See \u201c--If our actual loan losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our net income will decrease.\u201d We may also become subject to claims by regulatory agencies, customers, or other third parties due to the conduct of the third parties with which the Bank operates such lending programs if such conduct is deemed to not comply with applicable laws in connection with the marketing and servicing of loans originated pursuant to these programs.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations, and any related adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the banking industry or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022\na shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nlack of an active trading market for the common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; and\n\u2022\nannouncement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently subject to risks, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and is subject to forces that affect the financial markets in general. As a result, if you hold or acquire our common stock, it is possible that you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nFuture sales or additional issuances of our capital stock may depress prices of shares of our common stock or otherwise dilute the book value of shares then outstanding.\nSales of a substantial amount of our capital stock in the public market or the issuance of a significant number of shares could adversely affect the market price for shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2018, we were authorized to issue up to 90,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 39,167,280 shares were outstanding, and 24,783 shares were held as treasury stock. We were also authorized to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 3,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, none of which were outstanding or reserved for issuance. Future sales or additional issuances of stock may affect the market price for shares of our common stock.\nFederal regulations and our organizational documents may inhibit a takeover or prevent a transaction you may favor or limit our growth opportunities, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain provisions of our charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. In addition, we may need to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can acquire control of any other company. Such approvals could involve significant expenses related to diligence, legal compliance, and the submission of required applications and could be conditioned on acts or practices that limit or otherwise constrain our operations.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nWe have historically paid a quarterly dividend to stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, regulatory review, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 79571, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CASH"}
