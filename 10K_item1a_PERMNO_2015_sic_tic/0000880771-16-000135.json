{"cik": "880771", "company": "SCICLONE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information in this report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nAlthough we reported net income of $29.5 million, $25.2 million, $11.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, we have experienced significant operating losses in the past, and as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $118 million. If our operating expenses were to increase or if we were not able to increase or sustain revenue, we may not maintain profitability over the next 12 months.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility due to many factors, some of which we have no control over, including:\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulatory action affecting our Company or our drug products or our competitors' drug products in China, the US and other foreign countries, including the effect of government initiatives in China, particularly the Chinese government\u2019s increasing regulation of the pharmaceutical industry through anti-corruption activities;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulatory action intended to reduce pharmaceutical prices such as the reduction in the governmentally permitted maximum listed price for our products and increased oversight of the health care market and pharmaceutical industry;\n\u00b7\ncompliance by our employees with regulations that are applicable to sales and marketing activities, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, some of which may result from undertaking new clinical development projects, or from licensing or acquisition-related expenses including up-front fees, milestone payments, and other items;\n\u00b7\nprogress and results of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process in Europe and in China;\n\u00b7\ntiming and achievement of our corporate objectives;\n\u00b7\ncharges related to expired inventory or bad debt;\n\u00b7\nterminations of, or changes in our agreements or relationships with collaborative partners;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncement and completion of corporate acquisition, merger, licensing or marketing arrangements, or sales of assets;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the composition of our management team or Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in assessments of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated increases in our G&A expense due to legal and accounting expenses, including expenses relating to our dispute with MEDA, and arising out of matters relating to any additional or uncorrected control deficiency or related matters;\n\u00b7\neconomic and political conditions in the US or abroad, particularly in China;\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations between the RMB and US Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) including recent RMB devaluation that has led to, and may continue to lead to, downward adjustments in our importer price if further devaluation continues;\n\u00b7\nbroad financial market fluctuations in the US, Europe or Asia; and\n\u00b7\nMore aggressive taxation policy by the government in China.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAny acquisitions we may undertake involve a number of risks, and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. We may acquire other companies or products that present risks similar to those stated above.\nWe may enter into other company or product acquisition transactions in the future which could present integration or other risks similar to those stated above and may also cause us to:\n\u00b7\nissue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nassume liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nrecord goodwill and intangible assets that would be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u00b7\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\nincur large and immediate write-offs of in-process research and development costs; or become subject to litigation.\nOur revenue will continue to be substantially dependent on our sales of ZADAXIN in China.\nOur product revenue is highly dependent on the sales of ZADAXIN in China. We anticipate that sales of ZADAXIN will continue to be a majority of our revenue for at least the next two years. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 approximately 96%, 96% and 95% of our ZADAXIN sales, respectively, were to customers in China. Sales of ZADAXIN in China may be limited due to the low average personal income, lack of patient cost reimbursement, poorly developed infrastructure and competition from other products, including generics. ZADAXIN sales growth in recent years has benefited from the rapidly growing Chinese economy and growing personal disposable income. Sales of ZADAXIN in China could be adversely affected by a slowing or downturn of the Chinese economy and from the recent and future decisions of provincial agencies\u2019 pricing reform.\nIn China, ZADAXIN is approved for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (\u201cHBV\u201d) and as an immune system enhancer. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies who are aggressively marketing competing products for the treatment of HBV and for other indications where we believe ZADAXIN may be used on an off-label basis. In addition, several local companies are selling lower-priced, locally manufactured generic thymalfasin, which is a competitive product and is selling in substantial and increasing quantities. While generic products outsell ZADAXIN in unit volumes, we have been able to maintain a pricing advantage through the reputation of our imported, branded product. We believe such competition will continue with added new local manufacturers of generic thymalfasin and there could be a negative impact on the price and the volume of ZADAXIN sold in China, which would harm our business. Our efforts to in-license or acquire other pharmaceutical products for marketing in China and other markets may be unsuccessful or even if successful may not have a meaningful effect on our dependence on ZADAXIN sales in those markets.\nSales of ZADAXIN may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to financing limitations on importers, changes in inventory levels at our customers, and surges in sales and inventories due to epidemics. Importers and distributors of ZADAXIN borrow funds in China from banks to purchase, hold and distribute ZADAXIN. Substantial increases in restrictions on fund availability and/or increases in borrowing costs could limit the ability of our importers and distributors to finance their import and distribution process. Further, our customers tend to purchase large orders, and inventory levels may fluctuate significantly as a result, or as a result of changes in the distribution channel, potentially affecting quarterly periodic results.\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, we estimated that there was a substantial increase in ZADAXIN channel inventory levels and we believe that our sales to our customers exceeded the pace at which our customers were able to sell the ZADAXIN through to other parties, primarily hospital pharmacies. As a result, ZADAXIN revenues were lower in the first half of 2013, as compared to the same period of 2014. We believe channel inventory has returned to normal levels, and we continue to believe that we will grow demand for ZADAXIN through increased penetration in the market; however, we may not be successful or we may experience future fluctuations in channel inventory either of which could adversely affect our future ZADAXIN revenue.\nWe could experience fluctuations in channel inventory due to actual or expected epidemics. For example, during the second quarter of 2009, we experienced a strong upsurge in ZADAXIN sales, which we believe was attributable both to the increasing penetration of ZADAXIN within the Chinese market, as well as concerns in China from the H1N1 influenza virus. If distributors and hospitals that purchase ZADAXIN stockpile more ZADAXIN than needed for current use, our subsequent sales of ZADAXIN may suffer as distributors and hospitals use ZADAXIN already in their inventory before purchasing additional product from us. This could lead to uneven future revenue results for ZADAXIN and in turn materially impact our cash flows and business condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Chinese government has previously imposed price restrictions on ZADAXIN and several of our oncology products. If we experience difficulties in our sales efforts as a result, our operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nThe Chinese government is increasing its efforts to reduce overall health care costs, including pricing controls on pharmaceutical products. Individual provinces in China and, in some cases, individual hospitals can and have established pricing requirements for a product to be included on formulary lists. In some cases, these price limits have been significantly lower than prices at which our distributors have been selling ZADAXIN, in which case we have been removed from formulary lists, which consequently has reduced sales to certain hospitals and could adversely affect our future sales.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs, effective June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities are emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015; we were able to mitigate the impact of this price limitation by sharing the burden of the price reduction with our distributor. For fiscal 2015, we were able to mitigate the impact of this price limitation by shifting an equitable portion of the burden of the price reduction to our China distributor. We anticipate that provincial pricing decisions will continue to be a significant factor in the China pharmaceutical market for the foreseeable future. The impact of such decisions on our future results is unpredictable, but we expect that pricing pressures in 2016 will be offset at least in significant part through sharing of any potential further burden with our China distributor and potentially through volume increases. However, in the future, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline.\nThe pricing regulations in China, whether operating at a national, provincial or institutional level, as well as regulation of the importation of pharmaceutical products, have reduced retail prices of, and our own revenue from, ZADAXIN and our other products, and we expect that pricing pressure will continue. While the regulatory mechanisms are changing and the ultimate outcome is uncertain, and while we have been able to mitigate the impact of prior price reductions on our overall business, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, limit the volume of product which may be imported and sold or place high import duties on the product, any of which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline.\nWhile over the long term, we believe that the price reductions may positively affect our sales volumes and result in broader penetration into Tier 3 and Tier 2 cities in target geographies, potentially increasing our total sales revenues from these products, the process and timing for any price restrictions is unpredictable and further price reduction could be imposed that could adversely affect our business. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with our China distributor, Sinopharm, which commenced January 1, 2016, will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nOur business strategy is dependent in part on our agreements with third parties for the rights to develop and commercialize products, or promote products, particularly in China. We have experienced challenges in maintaining some of our agreements and if we fail to enter into additional agreements, our business will suffer.\nOur sales and marketing strategy in China depends significantly on agreements with third parties, and potentially on entering into additional agreements with third parties, or renegotiating agreements with third parties. Except for ZADAXIN, our rights to develop, market and sell our products in China, including licensed products and products currently promoted or sold by our subsidiaries, NovaMed and NovaMed Shanghai, are held by us under license, promotion, distribution or marketing agreements with third parties. These agreements for products include DC Bead, a product which we launched commercially in the third quarter of 2015, and products in the regulatory review process, including products in clinical trials that are held under license, distribution or marketing agreements. In addition, our success in the future may be dependent on entering into similar agreements with other parties and the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrenewal of any such agreements. The third parties to these agreements are generally not under an obligation to renew the agreements. If any of these agreements are terminated, or if they are not renewed, our ability to distribute, or develop, the products or product candidates could be terminated and our business could be affected.\nAll of our products were originally obtained by us under licenses, promotion, distribution or similar third-party agreements. We do not conduct product discovery and our ability to bring new products to market is dependent upon our entering into additional acquisition, in-licensing, promotion or distribution agreements, particularly in China. The competition for attractive products is intense, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate in-license, promotion or distribution agreements for additional products in the future.\nWhile in June 2013 we renewed our promotion agreement with Baxter for a 5-year term through December 2017 and in July 2014 we renewed our product distribution agreement with Pfizer for a 5-year term through June 2019, our promotion agreements with Sanofi were not renewed and expired on December 31, 2013. In addition, in August 2015, we and Cardiome mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, and return all rights to the product to Cardiome. We continue to assess the financial performance of the products we promote under our agreements and their overall value within our entire portfolio of products. Over time, we anticipate the product mix that we promote will change which may affect our revenues and profitability in the future. Terminations or failures to renew these or any other agreement as to some or all of the products covered by the agreement could result in a decline in revenue and in other costs including restructuring charges if a resulting revenue decline required us to reduce costs. On the other hand, if we are successful in negotiating better terms there may be a positive impact on our revenues and profitability.\nIf our products do not meet standards established by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, we could lose our license to import products to China for commercial sale, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur products are subject to standards established by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, or ChP. The ChP is an official compendium of drugs in China and sets the standards of purity, description, test, dosage, precaution, storage and the strength for each drug in China. The ChP is revised from time to time, with the most recent revisions set forth in a 2015 edition. If our products fail to meet ChP specifications during routine customs testing as such specifications may be revised from time to time, our import drug licenses (IDLs), which allow the importation for commercial sale, may be revoked, which would result in a significant loss of revenue and materially adversely affect our business.\nOur revenue will continue to be substantially dependent on our maintaining regulatory licenses and compliance with other regulations.\nWe have received regulatory approvals to import and market ZADAXIN in China and to manufacture ZADAXIN and export the product from Italy. In order to continue our sales to China, we need to maintain these approvals. Our license to import ZADAXIN into China needs to be renewed every five years and the next renewal is required in December 2017. Although renewals in the past were obtained successfully, there is no assurance that SciClone will receive renewals in the future when applied for or that the renewals will not be conditioned or limited in ways that limit our ability to sell ZADAXIN to China.\nOur licenses to manufacture and export ZADAXIN from Italy are dependent upon our continuing compliance with regulations in Italy. Our business would be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain these approvals. In order to sell ZADAXIN to the licensed importers in China, our manufacturers must 1) be approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (\u201cAIFA\u201d) and 2) be accepted by the CFDA. Some manufacturing changes may require: 1) approval by AIFA in Italy and/or 2) be accepted by the CFDA, the Chinese equivalent of the FDA. In addition, we must obtain an IDL from the CFDA in order to sell ZADAXIN to the licensed importers in China. ZADAXIN registration in Italy has been essential to the renewal of our IDL from the CFDA permitting the importation of ZADAXIN into China. Our ability to continue to renew our IDL from the CFDA permitting the importation of ZADAXIN into China could be adversely affected, if we were to fail to maintain ZADAXIN registration in Italy. The CFDA, AIFA and other regulatory agencies may, and have, changed their internal administrative rules in ways that may delay or complicate the regulatory approval process. Those changes are not always disclosed or known to us and we may experience unexpected delays or additional costs as a result of such changes. Our product has been distributed in Italy through BioFutura Pharma Srl (\u201cBioFutura\u201d), a subsidiary of Sigma-Tau Finanziaria, S.p.A. (\u201cSigma-Tau\u201d). In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with BioFutura to continue to distribute ZADAXIN for SciClone in Italy. However, if we are not able to continue this arrangement, we will need to establish alternative distribution operations in Italy to ensure continuing compliance with regulations in Italy and maintain our Italian licenses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur ZADAXIN sales and operations in China and in other parts of the world are subject to a number of risks and increasing regulations, including difficulties and delays in obtaining registrations, renewals of registrations, permits, pricing approvals and reimbursement, increasing regulation of product promotion and selling practices, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and political instability.\nOur resolution with government agencies in connection with violations by us of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs previously disclosed, since 2010 the SEC and the DOJ had each been conducting formal investigations of us regarding a range of matters, including possible violations of the FCPA, primarily related to certain historical sales and marketing activities with respect to our China operations. In response to these matters, our Board appointed the Special Committee to oversee our response to the government inquiry. Based on an initial review, the Special Committee decided to undertake an independent investigation as to matters reflected in and arising from the SEC and DOJ investigations in order to evaluate whether any violation of the FCPA or other laws occurred.\nOn February 4, 2016, we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA and that the DOJ had also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action. Under the terms of the settlement agreement with the SEC, SciClone paid a total of $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a penalty. The payment is in line with the charges the Company previously recorded and disclosed in its Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2015. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures.\nWhile we have resolved the previously pending matters with the SEC and DOJ, whether by virtue of announcement of the settlement agreement and the SEC Order or otherwise, we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments or further claims by third parties arising from conduct subject to the investigation or our other international operations. In addition, the remedial actions we have taken or may take as a result of such investigations may adversely affect our business in China and other countries, including adversely affecting our ability to obtain license renewals or other administrative approvals we require to conduct business in China and other countries.\nDespite the resolution of the SEC and DOJ matters, we may be subject to additional investigations or regulatory actions in the future.\nDespite the settlement of our SEC and DOJ matters, we may be subject to additional investigations in the future. We are unable to predict what ultimate consequences any investigation by any regulatory or law enforcement agency may have on us. Regulatory investigations that might be initiated in the future could result in substantial expenses, management diversion of attention, and harm to our business. If we fail to comply with regulations or to carry out controls on our Chinese or other foreign operations in a manner that satisfies all applicable laws, our business would be harmed. Any civil or criminal action commenced against us by a regulatory or law enforcement agency, including in China, could result in administrative orders against us, the imposition of significant penalties and/or fines against us, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our officers, directors and/or employees.\nIf we fail to achieve or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to protect from fraudulent, illegal or unauthorized transactions. If we cannot establish effective controls and provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. Moreover, as a US-based corporation doing business in China, these controls often need to satisfy the requirements of Chinese law as well as the requirements of US law which frequently differ in certain aspects. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, during the third quarter of 2012, our management determined that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the design and operation of our controls primarily associated with product returns reserves and the override of certain controls in the financial statement close process related to our NovaMed subsidiary. Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2012, our management determined that we had an additional indicator of the same material weakness related to the timing of revenue recognition for our Pfizer products and the override of related controls at our NovaMed subsidiary, and the corporate monitoring thereof. During fiscal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2014, we designed and implemented procedures to address the material weakness disclosed in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 related to the design and operating effectiveness of certain corporate monitoring controls. Management designed and implemented corporate monitoring controls and other controls that provided increased oversight over our China operations, and has remediated the material weakness as of December 31, 2014. We continuously work on improvements to our internal controls and there can be no assurance that these or other material weaknesses will not occur in the future, or otherwise cause us to inaccurately report our financial statements. For example, the restatement of our financial statements for each of our first, second, and third quarters of 2012, and our financial statements for each of the second and third quarters of 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2011, were in part caused by the material weakness related to the design and operation of our controls disclosed as of December 31, 2012 discussed above. Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to improve our internal controls or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted in and may continue to result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and The NASDAQ Stock Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and costs are increasing as a result of this uncertainty and other factors. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has and may continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThere can be no assurance that the strategic alternative process will result in pursuing or completing a particular transaction.\nIn early February 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had initiated a process to identify, examine and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to us with a view to enhancing stockholder value and had engaged Lazard Freres & Co. LLC as its financial advisor to assist the Board in evaluating strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives will result in either pursuing any different strategic operational approach or completing any particular transaction. We also may not accurately assess the risks and uncertainties associated with engaging in a strategic alternative, and the anticipated benefits from pursuing any such alternative may not materialize. In addition, undertaking a strategic process could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business, potentially having adverse effects on our existing business relationships and our key employees.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our employees and distribution network, and our reputation, business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected by actions taken by our distributors and third-party marketing firms.\nOur company policies prohibit our employees from making improper payments to hospitals or otherwise engaging in improper activities to influence the procurement decisions of hospitals, and we take remedial actions, including termination, when employees do not adhere to our policies. However, we may not be able to effectively ensure that every employee complies at all times with our policies. The compensation of our sales and marketing personnel is partially linked to their sales performance. Although we have made numerous changes to ensure compliance with our policies and to attempt to avoid any violation of law, we cannot assure you that employees will not violate the anticorruption laws of China, the US and other countries. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects and brand.\nFurthermore, we have identified from time to time certain instances of improperly submitted expense reporting by our employees. Our employees may seek to create additional opportunities to engage in misappropriation or other employee malfeasance. If our controls and procedures to prevent such activities fail or are circumvented, our business would be negatively affected by, among other things, the related financial losses, diminished reputation and threat of litigation and regulatory inquiry and investigation.\nWe do not control, and therefore have limited ability to manage, the activities of third-parties who assist us in marketing and distributing our products. Our distributors or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions which violate the anti-corruption laws of China, the US or other countries. Failure to adequately manage our employees, and third parties and, or their non-compliance with employment, distribution or marketing agreements, could harm our corporate image among hospitals and end users\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nof our products and disrupt our sales, resulting in a failure to meet our sales goals. Furthermore, we could be liable for actions taken by our employees, distributors or third-party marketing or third-party firms, including any violations of applicable law in connection with the marketing or sale of our products, including China\u2019s anticorruption laws and the FCPA of the US. In particular, if our employees, distributors or third-party marketing firms make any payments that are forbidden under China\u2019s anticorruption laws or the FCPA, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties imposed by the Chinese or US government.\nRecently, the Chinese government has increased its anti-corruption measures. In the pharmaceutical industry, corrupt practices include, among others, acceptance of kickbacks, bribes or other illegal gains or benefits by the hospitals and medical practitioners from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors in connection with the prescription of certain pharmaceuticals. Our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms may violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal practices with respect to their sales or marketing of our products or other activities involving our products. If our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate these laws, or are alleged to have violated these laws, we could be required to pay damages or fines, be subject to administrative actions or suffer additional consequences which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct business in China and our financial condition. In addition, Chinese laws regarding what types of payments to promote or sell our products are impermissible are not always clear, and local regulatory authorities enforcing these laws are not always consistent. As a result, we, our employees, affiliates, our distributors or third-party marketing firms could make certain payments in connection with the promotion or sale of our products or other activities involving our products which at the time are considered by us or them to be legal but are later deemed impermissible by the Chinese government, or we may be asked to make payments by local government authorities that may not be permissible under China\u2019s anticorruption laws or the FCPA. Furthermore, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or the price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm serving as our external auditor is an audit firm which is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), and, although they may be subject to other inspections, you do not have the benefits of PCAOB inspections.\nOur incumbent independent auditors\u2019 system of quality control and their individual audits are subject to review, inspection, or other outside assurance from time to time by member firms in the network of firms to which they belong, by peer accounting firms, or by regulatory or industry bodies in China (such as China\u2019s securities regulator or the Chinese body representing certified public accountants). However, these various bodies or parties are distinct from the PCAOB, and their efforts may not be concentrated on audits of SEC registrants. Their reviews or inspections may be substantially different, or not comparable to, an inspection by the PCAOB. Auditors of companies that are registered with the SEC and traded publicly in the US, including our independent registered public accounting firm, must be registered with the PCAOB, and are required by the laws of the US to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the US and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating audits and quality control procedures of any auditors operating in China, including our auditors. As a result, investors in our equity securities may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to other public company auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a result, investors in our stock may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nProceedings instituted by the SEC against certain PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nIn December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in China, alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based related companies under investigation by the SEC. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February 12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms, including our registered public accounting firm, appealed to the SEC against this sanction decision. In February 2015, the four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay $500,000 each to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit US- listed companies. The settlement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission. If the firms don\u2019t follow the procedures, the SEC could impose penalties such as suspensions, or it could restart the current enforcement case administrative proceedings.\nIn the event that the SEC restarts the enforcement administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the US with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, US-listed companies and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm were denied the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our shares from the Nasdaq Global Select Market or deregistration by the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our stock in the US.\nOur compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may put us at a competitive disadvantage, while our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may result in substantial penalties.\nAs a US reporting company, we are required to comply with the FCPA. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in practices in violation of the FCPA, we could suffer severe penalties. Non-US companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to the provisions of the FCPA. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in their business dealings, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nRetaliation from terminated employees may damage our reputation or lead to claims that could subject us to further regulatory action.\nFrom time to time we have terminated the employment of certain employees for performance-related reasons, including, in particular, our policies intended to prevent corruption. Employees who are terminated may seek more favorable terms of separation by threatening to damage our reputation in the marketplace. Further, they may seek to retaliate against us by making so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims under the provisions enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act that may entitle persons who report alleged wrong-doing to the SEC to cash rewards. We anticipate that these provisions will result in a significant increase in whistleblower claims across our industry, and dealing with such claims could generate significant expenses and take up significant management time, even for frivolous and non-meritorious claims. Any investigations of whistleblower claims may impose additional expense on us, may require the attention of senior management and members of the Board of Directors and may result in fines, adverse administrative sanctions or rulings and/or reputational damage whether or not we are deemed to have violated any regulations. Furthermore, terminated employees may also seek to retaliate against us by making claims against us to other regulatory agencies, including local regulatory authorities. Inquiries by local regulatory agencies about such claims, even if frivolous and non-meritorious, could also generate significant expenses and take up significant management and Board of Directors\u2019 time.\nWe may incur unexpected charges relating to our operations.\nAlthough we have generally experienced minimal product returns and our customers have historically paid all invoiced amounts, we could incur future charges relating to inventory that expires or as a result of customer failures to pay invoiced amounts timely or in full. For example, we recorded $0.5 million of bad debt expense in general and administrative expense for the first quarter of 2015 related to one customer whose accounts receivable are uncertain of collection. In addition, we recorded $2.4 million to bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to one customer whose accounts receivable were significantly past due and for which collectability was uncertain at that time. Although we subsequently collected $1.5 million of these receivables in fiscal 2014 and a further $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, there still remains $0.5 million awaiting collection that is fully reserved. We also recorded charges of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 for potential inventory obsolescence related to Aggrastat. We have had and could also experience additional charges for potential inventory obsolescence related to other products if we are unable to sell units that are nearing their expiration dates, or for bad debt if other distributors do not pay outstanding receivables in full. Those or similar future events would have an adverse impact upon our operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are at risk of additional securities class action and derivative lawsuits.\nSecurities class action and derivative lawsuits are often filed against public companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. After our announcement regarding SEC and DOJ investigations in 2010, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as parties in purported stockholder class actions and derivative lawsuits. Those class action lawsuits were dismissed and we have settled those derivative lawsuits. Our stock price declined following the announcement of a restatement of our financial statements for fiscal 2011 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, and that our predecessor independent auditing firm had elected not to stand for reappointment for the 2013 fiscal year. Soon after that announcement, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as parties in a purported derivative lawsuit relating to the restatement, which was subsequently dismissed in its entirety. We may experience stock price volatility in the future related to other matters. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years. We may be named in additional litigation, which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such litigation could result in additional substantial costs and a diversion of management's and the Board of Directors\u2019 attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nWe have numerous products under development in China, some of which were acquired in the NovaMed acquisition and others which were in-licensed by us. In recent years, we have in-licensed several additional product candidates for each of which our future development expenses and milestone payments could be material.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that our product candidates are ineffective or have unanticipated side effects and/or drug interactions that may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval. For example, in March 2012, we announced the discontinuation of our phase 2b clinical trial evaluating SCV-07 for the delayed onset of oral mucositis. This decision was based on the results of a pre-planned interim analysis that indicated that the trial would not meet the pre-specified efficacy endpoints, and we have no plans to proceed with further development of SCV-07 at this time.\nThe regulatory approval processes in the US, Europe and China are demanding, lengthy and expensive. We have committed significant resources, including capital and time, to develop and seek approval for products under development, and if we do not obtain approvals we are seeking, we may be unable to achieve any revenue from these products. All new drugs, including our product candidates, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, CFDA and similar regulatory agencies. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, importation, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. These regulations may change from time to time and new regulations may be adopted.\nSatisfaction of government regulations may take several years and the time needed to satisfy them varies substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. As a result, government regulation may cause us to delay the introduction of, or prevent us from marketing, our existing or potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We have experienced delays in the regulatory process, and there exists risk that we may not receive approval of in-licensed products currently in the regulatory process. In addition, the Chinese government is increasing its efforts to reduce overall health care costs, including pricing controls on pharmaceutical products. We cannot determine what the potential government pricing constraints are likely to be for products in development in advance. Therefore, we may be required to abandon the development or commercialization of a product after significant effort and expense if we determine at any time that trends in government pricing constraints will make the commercialization of a product unprofitable.\nTo fully develop these products and other products we may acquire, substantial resources are required for extensive research, development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, and manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to the potential products being ready for sale. We cannot assure that our efforts will produce commercially viable products. We face significant technological risks inherent in developing these products. We may also abandon some or all of our proposed products before they become commercially viable. We are obligated to make a milestone payment upon regulatory approval of certain products under development. If any of our products, even if developed and approved, cannot be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, our business will be harmed and the price of our stock may decline.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMarket acceptance of any product that is successfully developed and approved will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince prospective customers to use our products as an alternative to other treatments and therapies. In addition, doctors must opt to use treatments involving our products. If doctors elect to use a different course of treatment, demand for our drug products would be reduced. In addition, for certain products we may need to convince partners to manufacture or market our products. Failure to do any of the above will lead to an unfavorable outcome on the results of our operations.\nOur sales are concentrated in China and we face risks relating to operating in China, including risks due to changes in the regulatory environment, slow payment cycles and exposure to fluctuations in the Chinese economy.\nA significant portion of our revenue and profit is derived from operations in China. Consequently, our overall financial results are dependent on this market, and our business is exposed to risks there. In addition to the risks relating to pricing previously discussed above, these risks also include changes in economic conditions (including wage and cost inflation, currency exchange rates, consumer spending and employment levels), tax rates, laws, changes in the regulatory environment, increased competition and potential noncompliance with local laws and regulations. Risks also include changing consumer product preferences and preferred sales channels, as well as our ability to accommodate such changing preferences. Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. Any significant or prolonged deterioration in China\u2019s relations with the United States and other countries could adversely affect our China business. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such risks and uncertainties on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn addition to the risk relating to pricing regulations and other risks related to operating in China, as discussed above, we experience other issues with managing sales operations in China including long payment cycles, potential difficulties in timely accounts receivable collection and, especially from significant customers, fluctuations in the timing and amount of orders and the adverse effect of any of these issues on our business could be increased due to the concentration of our business with a small number of distributors. Problems with collections from, or sales to, any one of those distributors could materially adversely affect our results. Operations in foreign countries including China also expose us to risks relating to difficulties in enforcing our proprietary rights, currency fluctuations and adverse or deteriorating economic conditions. If we experience problems with these matters, or if significant regulatory limitations are imposed on our ability to terminate employees and on the related costs, political, economic or regulatory changes occur, our results could be adversely affected. During the third quarter of 2014, we wrote-off $1.1 million of $3.5 million in fully reserved accounts receivable related to one customer. For that customer, we received $1.5 million in payments on fully reserved accounts receivable in 2014 and a further $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, and the remaining fully reserved accounts receivable balance of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015 is substantially delinquent. Although we entered into a settlement agreement with this customer in October 2014, and the customer had a binding obligation to pay us the remaining $0.5 million by December 31, 2015, we did not receive the payment as of December 31, 2015 and there can be no assurance if we are not paid and we pursue legal action what the timing or result of such action would be.\nOur operations throughout the world including China are potentially subject to the laws and regulations of the US including the FCPA, in addition to the laws and regulations of the other countries. Regulation in China of the activities in the pharmaceutical industry has increased and may continue to undergo significant and unanticipated changes. A number of companies have faced significant expenses or fines as a result of the increasing regulation of, and enforcement activity regarding, the pharmaceutical industry. The Chinese government has recently made arrests of pharmaceutical company employees for allegedly illegal sales and marketing activities. Recent or future arrests of sales personnel, doctors or others in the pharmaceutical industry, whether or not the individuals violated laws or regulations, could impact the operations and results of pharmaceutical companies in China, including our own. The Chinese government has also been investigating the costs to manufacture approximately 40 pharmaceutical products sold in China. While SciClone was not involved in either of these actions, these actions may be an indication of heightened Chinese government oversight of the pharmaceutical industry, and of multinational pharmaceutical companies in particular. Such activities could have long-term implications for the pharmaceutical industry in China including increased pricing pressure and a heightened level of government oversight and investigations, either of which could adversely affect the industry as a whole or individual companies, including SciClone.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business is sensitive to the economy in China. A downturn in the Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAny slowdown in China\u2019s economic development might lead to tighter credit markets, increased market volatility, sudden drops in business and consumer confidence and dramatic changes in business and consumer behaviors. Economic growth rates in China are slowing and there has been significant volatility in the stock indexes within China. The Chinese government is believed to take an active role in influencing stock indexes and in many other areas, but there is no assurance that growth rates will not continue to decline. Slowing growth in China, stock market volatility and uncertainty in economic conditions, may cause a decline in sales of ZADAXIN or negatively impact our other products. A decline is demand for our products in China could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nCurrently all of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the US, and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the US. US income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of non-US subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. The US government may propose initiatives that would substantially reduce our ability to defer US taxes including: repealing deferral of US taxation of foreign earnings, eliminating utilization or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the US. If any of these proposals are constituted into legislation, they could increase our US income tax liability and as a result have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nChinese healthcare regulation and the Chinese market are changing rapidly and we may modify our strategy in response to those changes and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing changes.\nThe Chinese healthcare and regulatory environment have changed and are likely to continue to change in response to Chinese government policies and other factors. We intend to evaluate and make modifications to our strategy in response to these changes. We intend to continue our strategies of growing business in China by expanding ZADAXIN sales, entering into new promotional agreements, and seeking of products that have been approved outside China, but we may implement additional strategies, including expanding our capabilities in China to develop earlier stage products in-licensed from third parties in China or elsewhere. If we make significant additions or changes to our strategy, we may not be successful in implementing such changes, or the Chinese market may change in unexpected directions to which we are not able to respond timely.\nWe may lose market share or otherwise fail to compete effectively in the intensely competitive pharmaceutical industry.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry in China is intense, and we believe that competition will increase. Our success depends on our ability to compete in this industry, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors. Increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price-based competition resulting in lower prices and margins, which would hurt our operating results. We cannot assure you that we will compete successfully against our competitors or that our competitors, or potential competitors, will not develop drugs or other treatments for our targeted indications that will be superior to ours.\nWe depend on sales to China, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations in and outside of China. Changes in China\u2019s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance.\nOur business is concentrated in China. Heightened tensions resulting from the current geopolitical conditions in the Middle East, North Korea and elsewhere could worsen, causing disruptions in foreign trade, which would harm our sales. In particular, our commercial product is manufactured in Europe and distributed by us from our operations in Hong Kong. Any disruption of our supply and distribution activities due to geopolitical conditions could decrease our sales and harm our operating results. In addition, while we continue our efforts to expand our operations in and outside of China, disruptions in our marketing or distribution efforts could delay or limit our ability to expand. We have had distributors with whom our accounts receivable collectability has become uncertain where, in addition to the charges that may result from the collectability of the accounts receivable, we may experience delays in our efforts to expand our operations and lose business to our competitors from any resulting disruption.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWith respect to China, our financial performance may be affected by changes in China\u2019s political, social, regulatory and economic environment. The role of the Chinese central and local governments in the Chinese economy is significant. Chinese policies toward economic liberalization, and laws and policies affecting foreign companies, currency exchange rates and other matters could change, resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business in China. Any imposition of surcharges or any increase in Chinese tax rates could hurt our operating results. The Chinese government could revoke, terminate or suspend our license for national security and similar reasons or in the event our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate Chinese anticorruption laws, or are alleged to have violated these laws, without compensation to us. If the government of China were to take any of these actions, we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business. Any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to market our products in China.\nBecause of China's tiered method of importing and distributing finished pharmaceutical products, our quarterly results may vary substantially from one period to the next; we are dependent upon Sinopharm as the exclusive importer of ZADAXIN.\nImported products in China, including ZADAXIN and NovaMed\u2019s imported products, are distributed through a tiered method to import and distribute finished pharmaceutical products. Promoted products are typically sold from our partner companies within China to the primary distributor with the following distribution being the same for imported as well as promoted products. At each port of entry, and prior to moving the product forward to the distributors, government-licensed importing agents must process and evaluate each imported product shipment to determine whether it satisfies China's quality assurance requirements. In order to efficiently manage this process, the importing agents typically place large, and therefore relatively few, orders within an annual period. Therefore, sales to an importing agent can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the size and timing of the orders, which has in the past and may in the future cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. We rely on Sinopharm to supply our ZADAXIN sales. Our receivables from Sinopharm are material, and if we were unable to collect receivables from Sinopharm or any other importer, our business and cash-flow would be adversely affected. In 2012, we also relied on another distributor to supply our ZADAXIN product. Receivables from this importer are $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015 that are more than one year past due and fully reserved, and if we were unable to collect these receivables, our business and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nGenerally, our importers are not obligated to place purchase orders for our product, and if they determined for any reason not to place purchase orders, we would need to seek alternative licensed importers, which could cause fluctuations in our revenue. As a result of our agreement granting certain exclusive importation rights to Sinopharm for ZADAXIN, we are dependent upon Sinopharm\u2019s performance of its obligations under that agreement. We have a long-standing and, we believe excellent, relationship with Sinopharm; however, if Sinopharm were unable to adequately perform its obligations under, or breached, the agreement our business would be adversely affected.\nThe existence of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in China\u2019s pharmaceutical retail market may damage our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain medicine products distributed or sold in China\u2019s pharmaceutical retail market, including those appearing to be our products, may be counterfeit. Counterfeit products are products sold under the same or very similar brand names and/or have a similar appearance to genuine products. Counterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceutical products, are a significant problem in China and we have experienced counterfeiting of our products. Such counterfeit products divert sales from genuine products, often are of lower cost, often are of lower quality (having different ingredients or formulations, for example), and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. The counterfeit pharmaceutical product regulation control and enforcement system in China is not able to completely eliminate production and sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. To increase our ability to prevent counterfeiting, we have taken several actions, including enhancements of our product labeling to implement industry-leading labeling technology and implementation of product tracking applications. However we cannot eliminate counterfeiting and, any sale of counterfeit products resulting in adverse side effects to consumers may subject us to negative publicity and expenses. It could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe majority of our sales have been in US dollars, although a portion of our sales are denominated in RMB. Per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm through December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm (our sole importer and distributor for ZADAXIN in China) which took effect January 1, 2016, our sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm have been and continue to be denominated in US dollars. However, the established importer price may be adjusted quarterly based upon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nexchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and RMB. In recent months the RMB has experienced devaluation; accordingly, our importer price has been and can continue to be adjusted downward as denominated in US dollars. Our purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in US dollars and euros and costs of our marketing efforts in China are paid in local currency. In addition, we have certain cash balances and other assets and liabilities denominated in euros, RMB and Hong Kong dollars. Fluctuation in the US dollar exchange rate with local currency directly affects the customer's cost for our product. In particular, a stronger US dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the local currency would tend to have an adverse effect on sales and potentially on collection of accounts receivable. China currently maintains the value of the RMB in a narrow currency trading band that may or may not fluctuate based on government policy. For example, in August 2015, the Chinese government devalued the RMB and may further devalue the RMB at any time. This devaluation has resulted in the strengthening of the US dollar and may reflect a weakening of the Chinese economy. Depending on market conditions and the state of the Chinese economy, China has intervened in the foreign exchange market in the past to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate, and it could make future adjustments, including moving to a managed float system, with opportunistic interventions. This reserve diversification may negatively impact the US dollar and US interest rates. A trend to a stronger US dollar would erode margins earned by our Chinese importers and prompt them to ask us to lower our prices. A weaker US dollar would increase our in-country China operating expenses, and with the addition of NovaMed, our China operating expenses have increased. We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of expenses incurred by our foreign operations. In particular, one of our supply arrangements under which we purchase finished products is denominated in euros and costs of our operations in China are paid in local currency. Consequently, changes in exchange rates could unpredictably and adversely affect our operating results and could result in exchange losses. To date, we have not hedged against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and stock price.\nWe cannot predict the safety profile of the use of ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market particularly when used in combination with other drugs.\nWhile ZADAXIN has an excellent safety profile, we cannot predict whether ZADAXIN or any product we market may have unexpected safety issues in a particular patient population or when used in new indications. In addition, we cannot predict how ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market will work with other drugs, including causing possible adverse side effects not directly attributable to the other drugs that could compromise the safety profile of ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market when used in certain combination therapies. We are exploring new indications for ZADAXIN and there is a risk that new safety issues could appear in these new patient populations.\nAs we introduce new products, such as DC Bead, to the market in China, there may be adverse safety events related to those products. Adverse safety events may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales or stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nIf third-party reimbursement is not available or patients cannot otherwise pay for ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop, we may not be able to successfully market them.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of therapeutic products, such as ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop. We cannot assure you that third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products we might develop. Although ZADAXIN receives some limited reimbursement in certain provinces in China, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing reimbursements or increase third-party payments for ZADAXIN or obtain third-party payments for other products that we sell or develop in China. The failure to obtain or maintain third-party reimbursement for our products would harm our business. Further, we cannot assure you that additional limitations will not be imposed in the future in the US or elsewhere on drug coverage and reimbursement due to proposed health care reforms. In many emerging markets where we have marketing rights to ZADAXIN, but where government resources and per capita income may be so low that our products will be prohibitively expensive, we may not be able to market our products on economically favorable terms, if at all.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRecent efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce health care costs and the announcement of legislative proposals and reforms to implement government controls has caused us to reduce the prices at which we market our drugs in China, and additional reforms, if they were to occur, could cause us to further reduce our prices which could reduce our gross margins and may harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties who are our sole source suppliers for our clinical trial and commercial products and their inability to deliver products that meet our quality-control standards could delay or harm one or more important areas of our business including our sales, clinical trials or the regulatory approval process.\nWe rely on third parties, who are subject to regulatory oversight, to supply our commercial products. Any deficiencies or shortages in supply of our commercial products would adversely affect our ability to realize our sales plans. For example, the manufacturing of the raw material and the processing to finished product of ZADAXIN is done in few batches in any given three-month period and any manufacturing errors have the potential to require a product recall. We currently have only one approved finished vial manufacturer and two approved active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) suppliers. If we experience a problem with the manufacturer or our suppliers, our sales may suffer. We have each experienced difficulties with obtaining product from manufacturers in the past. During 2012, we experienced limitations on supply of several products we were promoting (each of which we no longer market) and the growth in the sales of those products was affected. During 2011, we experienced manufacturing delays related to repairs for general, non-production-related facilities equipment at one of our API suppliers. During 2010, we experienced difficulties validating upgrades to equipment with one of our API manufacturers. Although we are taking steps to ensure that such problems do not continue, there is no assurance that we will either be successful in doing so with our current supplier or be able to timely and cost-effectively qualify new suppliers for this component. Manufacturing interruptions or failure or delay of product to meet quality assurance specifications could adversely affect shipments and recognition of sales of our products in any period and impair our relationships with customers and our competitive position and may increase the cost of material produced. In addition, each of the products that are marketed through our NovaMed subsidiary is manufactured by, or obtained from, a single source.\nWe also rely on third parties, who are subject to regulatory oversight, to supply drug product. For example, ONXEO (formerly BioAlliance) is the sole supplier of Loramyc. Any unanticipated deficiencies in this supplier, or the suppliers of our raw materials, and/or recall of the manufacturing lots could also impede commercialization of our products and impair our competitive position. In addition, any unanticipated deficiencies in suppliers used in our clinical trials could delay the trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data and its potential use in future regulatory filings. In addition, manufacturing interruptions or failure to comply with regulatory requirements by any of these suppliers could significantly delay clinical development of potential products and reduce third-party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed trials.\nIf our thymalfasin API or ZADAXIN products are not shipped and stored at precision temperatures, the products could become damaged, which could negatively affect our sales and operating results.\nThymalfasin API and ZADAXIN are temperature sensitive products. SciClone relies on third-party organizations to provide controlled temperature shipping logistics services from the point of ownership transfer from the API contract manufacturer to the point where thymalfasin API is converted to ZADAXIN drug product, and from the ZADAXIN drug product manufacturing site to our storage locations in Hong Kong and then to China. Although some temperature excursions are allowable and thymalfasin and ZADAXIN are relatively stable when exposed to temperatures higher than recommended, if any third-party logistics or equipment provider fails to perform their required oversight duties with respect to temperature control or a shipment is delayed in transit for a prolonged period of time, the thymalfasin API or ZADAXIN drug product could become unsuitable for subsequent processing or commercial use. Although we have not experienced cold chain interruptions in the past and our distributor in China may maintain several months supply of our product, were our cold chain distribution or warehouse capability to be interrupted, our ability to timely deliver finished product to China could be adversely affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties for development of our products and the inability of any of these parties to reliably, timely or cost-effectively provide us with their obligated services could materially harm the timing of bringing our products to market and accordingly adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, and collaborative partners in the conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates. If these parties, whom we do not control, do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines or choose not to continue their\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrelationship with us, if the third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical or clinical activities may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nCommercialization of some of our products depends on collaborations with others. If our collaborators are not successful, or if we are unable to find future collaborators, we may not be able to properly develop and commercialize our products.\nWe depend in part on our distributors and business partners to develop or promote our drugs, and if they are not successful in their efforts or fail to do so, our business will suffer. We generally do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that our business partners devote to our collaborative efforts, and some have not always performed as or when expected. If they do not perform their obligations as we expect, particularly obligations regarding clinical trials, our development expenses would increase and the development or sale of our products could be limited or delayed, which could hurt our business and cause our stock price to decline. In addition, our relationships with these companies may not be successful. Disputes may arise with our collaborators, including disputes over ownership rights to intellectual property, know-how or technologies developed with our collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate similar additional arrangements in the future to develop and commercialize ZADAXIN or other products.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional, highly skilled and experienced personnel, including the ability to expand our sales staff, our business will suffer.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the specialized, scientific and worldwide nature of our business. We are also dependent on our ability to appropriately staff these personnel in appropriate positions as our business fluctuates. Further, our efforts to in-license or acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates for China may require the addition of clinical and regulatory personnel and the expansion of, or changes in our sales and marketing operation. In addition, we assign numerous key responsibilities to a limited number of individuals, and we would experience difficulty in finding immediate replacements for any of them were any one of them to choose to leave employment with us. There is intense competition for qualified management, scientific, clinical, regulatory, and sales and marketing personnel in the pharmaceutical industry.\nThere is significant turnover in the industry, in China in particular, and we have also experienced turnover in our sales personnel and key employees. We may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to grow and develop our business globally.\nWe have terminated personnel for violations of our policies and procedures as well as for lack of performance. Our future success will depend in part on our retaining key personnel and on recruiting additional senior sales and other personnel in China. We are continuously recruiting executives and other level personnel to address departures and to expand and strengthen our China operations.\nConversely, if we need to reduce the size of a particular aspect of our business, including if we have contracts that are not renewed or renegotiated for products we market or promote, we are also dependent on our ability to make such adjustments while retaining suitably skilled personnel. For example, we reduced the size of our sales force as a result of the expiration of our agreement with Sanofi at the end of 2013. In addition, we have taken corrective measures based on the findings of our Special Committee relating to its investigation of matters relating to the FCPA and have taken, and expect to continue to take, corrective measures relating to managements\u2019 evaluation of internal control over financial reporting which could have adverse effects on our business, including the loss of personnel, and changes in marketing, sales and educational practices or programs. If we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed or promptly replace those employees who are critical to our sales, development and other operations, and in particular senior executives, our financial results and operations would be adversely affected. At this time, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance for any of our personnel.\nWe may need to obtain additional funding to support our long-term product development, including funding of in-licensed products, and commercialization programs.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. We may use cash to acquire additional product rights or for future acquisitions. Our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is dependent on numerous factors including our ability to achieve increasing sales of ZADAXIN and DC Bead in China, and for our other products including those products we acquired as a result of the NovaMed acquisition and the execution and successful completion of clinical trials in China. Further, we may use cash to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfund products we in-license. We cannot assure you that such funds from operating activities will be sufficient, or that we will attain profitable operations in future periods. In addition, we intend to develop other products and we may need additional funds in the future to support such development and to support future growth and achieve profitability. If we need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds are not available on reasonable terms, if at all, our commercialization efforts may be impeded, our revenues may be limited and our operating results may suffer.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes which could reduce our future operating income.\nWe have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where:\n\u00b7\ntax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment; or\n\u00b7\nincome tax rates are low.\nOur taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. For example, on March 16, 2007, the Chinese government passed a unified enterprise income tax law which became effective on January 1, 2008. Among other things, the law cancels many income tax incentives previously applicable to one of our subsidiaries in China. The law provides a transition rule which increased the tax rate of one of our subsidiaries in China over a 5-year period to 25% by 2012. The law also increased the standard withholding rate on earnings distributions to between 5% and 10% depending on the residence of the shareholder. The ultimate effect of these and other changes in Chinese tax laws on our overall tax rate will be affected by, among other things, our China income, the manner in which China interprets, implements and applies the new tax provisions, and by our ability to qualify for any exceptions or new incentives.\nIn addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions, particularly in the US and China. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur. However, we cannot be certain that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nIf we fail to protect our products, technologies and trade secrets, we may not be able to successfully use, manufacture, market or sell our products, or we may fail to advance or maintain our competitive position, and we have limited intellectual property protection in China.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products and technologies and to preserve our trade secrets. Our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the future. Our patents or patent applications may not have priority over others' applications. Our existing patents and additional patents that may be issued, if any, may not provide a competitive advantage to us or may be invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. Others may independently develop similar products or design around patents issued or licensed to us. Patents issued to, or patent applications filed by, other companies could harm our ability to use, manufacture, market or sell our products or maintain our competitive position with respect to our products. Although many of our patents relating to thymalfasin have expired, including composition of matter patents, we have rights to other patents and patent applications relating to thymalfasin and thymalfasin analogues, including method of use patents with respect to the use of thymalfasin for certain indications. Additionally, thymalfasin has received Orphan Drug designation in the US for the treatment of stage 2b through stage 4 melanoma, for the treatment of chronic active hepatitis B, for the treatment of DiGeorge anomaly with immune defects, and for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. If other parties develop generic forms of thymalfasin for other indications, including conducting clinical trials for such indications, our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing and selling such generic forms of thymalfasin or their brands of thymalfasin. If other parties develop analogues or derivatives of thymalfasin, our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing these analogues or derivatives.\nPharmaceutical products are either not patentable or have only recently become patentable in some of the countries in which we market or may market thymalfasin. We do not have composition patent claims directed to the thymalfasin that is currently marketed in China, our largest market, although we do have other type of patent claims, pending or issued, directed to other aspects of thymalfasin therapy. Other companies market generic thymalfasin in China, potentially in violation of our patent, trademark or other rights which,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nto date, we have defended by informing physicians and hospitals of the practice. Past enforcement of intellectual property rights in many of these countries, including China in particular, has been limited or non-existent. Future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country. Claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation, so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions.\nIf we are involved in intellectual property claims and litigation, the proceedings may divert our resources and subject us to significant liability for damages, substantial litigation expense and the loss of our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our not infringing valid, enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties, and not breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products. In addition, we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our potential products. For example, US patent applications may be kept confidential for 12 or more months while pending in the Patent and Trademark Office, and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published nine months or more after filing. It is possible that we may unintentionally infringe these patents or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may in the future receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third-party patents. Any legal action against us or our collaborative partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes affected by third-party rights may require us or our collaborative partners to obtain licenses in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes. Our efforts to defend against any of these claims, regardless of merit, would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans. In addition, these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages. We or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.\nIf other companies obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternate technology to manufacture or market the affected products and processes. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms or at all. Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products. Our efforts to defend against any of these claims would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans.\nWe may need to initiate litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive, to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others' rights. If litigation results, a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor's rights. If any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the US that claim technology we also have invented, the Patent and Trademark Office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology. These actions may subject us to potential liability for damages. We or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nSubstantial sales of our stock or the exercise or conversion of options may impact the market price of our common stock.\nWhile we do not have any plans to issue common stock other than with respect to equity compensation, future issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Similarly, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock or sell equity in a subsidiary, the percentage ownership of our present stockholders of the respective entities will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are subject to certain risks which could materially adversely affect our overall financial position.\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments which historically have been highly liquid and carried relatively low risk. However, with turmoil in the credit markets, similar types of investments have experienced losses in value or liquidity issues which differ from their historical pattern. For example, we routinely have invested in money market funds with large financial institutions. One or more of these funds could experience losses or liquidity problems and, although to date some of the largest financial institutions who sponsor such funds have offset similar losses, there is no assurance that our financial institutions would either not incur losses or would offset any losses were they to occur.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAny adjustment to decrease the ratings of our investments by a statistical rating organization (such as Moody\u2019s or Standard and Poor\u2019s) may have a negative impact on the value of our investments.\nShould any of our cash investments permanently lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it would have a material and adverse effect on our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise and such financing may not be available on commercially attractive terms.\nIn addition, financial instruments may subject us to a concentration of credit risk. Most of our cash and cash equivalents are held by a limited number of financial institutions. To date, we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents. However, if any of these instruments permanently lost value or have their liquidity impaired, it would also have a material and adverse effect on our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise and such financing may not be available on commercially attractive terms.\nWe expect that we may need to transfer capital to NovaMed Shanghai from time to time to fund its operations. We need to obtain regulatory approval from China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) in order to make such transfers and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner. We have been able to fund the operations of NovaMed Shanghai to date through commercial credit facilities or through intercompany loans, but we could face difficulties in the future if our efforts to improve profitability and cash flow in NovaMed Shanghai are not successful, or if we are unable to obtain SAFE approval or obtain further funding for NovaMed Shanghai.\nFurthermore, a majority of our cash is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Such cash is used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 2015, but we do anticipate a need to repatriate a portion of future foreign earnings to fund our US operations which will result in the need to accrue for US income taxes on those future foreign earnings that we anticipate repatriating from our foreign subsidiaries.\nOur loans receivable are subject to certain risks which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nAs part of our May 2013 license and supply agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million to Zensun, of which $12 million had been loaned as of December 31, 2015. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes by Zensun. As security for the loan agreements, Zensun pledged its entire equity interest in its subsidiary Shanghai Dongxin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (whose assets include real property) to us. If the real property which comprises the majority of the value of all of the assets pledged as security were to suffer a decrease in its value due to macroeconomic conditions or local market-specific factors impacting commercial real estate market values, such a fact may represent an indication of loan impairment. If these loans were to become impaired and the loans could not be collected, our financial position could be negatively impacted with a charge to operations for the amount of any unpaid principal and interest.\nOur ability to utilize our tax attributes may be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes, such as our US federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and our tax credit carryforwards, may be substantially restricted if we have had in the past, or have in the future, an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the US Internal Revenue Code. An ownership change occurs if increases in the percentage of our stock held by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382, which provides that certain public groups can be treated as 5-percent shareholders) collectively exceed more than fifty percent, comparing the lowest percentage of stock owned by each 5-percent shareholder at any time during the testing period (which is generally a three-year rolling period) to the percentage of stock owned by the 5-percent shareholder immediately after the close of any owner shift testing date. Our repurchases of our Common Stock, issuances of any additional significant amounts of our Common Stock for future acquisitions or other transactions and trading in our stock by stockholders, may have increased the possibility that in the future we could experience an ownership change. Trading by our stockholders, stock repurchases or other transactions could, in the future, cause an ownership change, resulting in an annual limitation on utilization of our tax attributes. If our tax attribute usage is subject to limitation and if we are profitable, our future cash flows could be adversely affected due to an increased tax liability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our charter documents contain certain anti-takeover provisions, including provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders may not cumulate votes, stockholders' meetings may be called by stockholders only if they hold 25% or more of our common stock and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue 10 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by the stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Also, on December 18, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (collectively, the \u201cRights\u201d) for each outstanding share of our Common Stock, each Right which entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company\u2019s Series D Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, at a price of $25.00 pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated as of December 19, 2006, between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, that expires December 19, 2016. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. Under certain circumstances the Rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. Although the Rights should not interfere with an acquisition of the Company approved by the Board, the Rights may have the effect of delaying and perhaps improving the terms of an acquisition for our stockholders, or deterring an acquisition of the Company. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nWe may be subject to product liability lawsuits, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover damages.\nClinical trials of any of our current and potential products or the actual commercial sales of our product may expose us to liability claims from the use of these products. We currently carry product liability insurance. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, for clinical and commercial activities, that any insurance we have will cover any particular claim that is asserted, or that the insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall. If we fail to have sufficient coverage, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations, our business may be harmed.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products (including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents), as well as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the experimental use of animals. The extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action in these areas cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe do not currently maintain hazardous materials at our facilities. While we outsource our research and development programs involving the controlled use of biohazardous materials, if in the future we conduct these programs ourselves, we might be required to incur significant cost to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Further, in the event of an accident, we would be liable for any damages that result, and the liability could exceed our resources.\nOur business and operations are subject to the risks of being based in particular locations known for earthquakes, other natural catastrophic disasters and service interruptions.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Although we maintain a disaster recovery policy that includes storage of important corporate data in a different geographic region of the US, all of our significant corporate data is stored in our headquarters facility and accordingly, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Most of our sales are into China for which we maintain our warehouses for finished goods in Hong Kong, which can experience severe typhoon storms, earthquakes or other natural catastrophic disasters. Although our distributors in China may maintain several months supply of our product, were our warehouse capability to be interrupted, either through a natural disaster such as flooding or through a service interruption, such as a lack of electricity to power required air conditioning, our ability to timely deliver finished product to China could be adversely affected which in turn would materially adversely affect our sales and ensuing operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity if it were to disrupt the demand, supply or delivery of product, management of our business, or result in cost increases as a result of government regulation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, certain information regarding our business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our computer networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and reputation. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Although we have not been adversely affected in any significant manner, we have experienced problems with information security in the past which we believe is primarily due to breaches of security by current or former employees gaining access to restricted information. Any such breach could compromise our computer networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Although we have purchased cyber liability insurance, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position.", "PERMNO": 77413, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SCLN"}
