Risk Factors\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that we currently believe could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors are in addition to those mentioned in other parts of this report and are not all of the risks that we face. We could also be affected by risks that we currently are not aware of or that we currently do not consider material to our business.\nWe face competition and accelerating pricing pressure.\nThe medical/surgical supply distribution industry in the United States is highly competitive and characterized by pricing pressure which accelerated in 2016 and put further margin pressure on our business. We expect this margin pressure to continue through 2017. We compete with other national distributors and a number of regional and local distributors, as well as customer self-distribution models and, to a lesser extent, certain third-party logistics companies. Competitive factors within the medical/surgical supply distribution industry include market pricing, total delivered product cost, product availability, the ability to fill and invoice orders accurately, delivery time, range of services provided, efficient product sourcing, inventory management, information technology, electronic commerce capabilities, and the ability to meet customer-specific requirements. Our success is dependent on the ability to compete on the above factors, while managing internal costs and expenses. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation in response to cost containment legislation and general market pressures to reduce costs. This consolidation of our customers and suppliers generally gives them greater bargaining power to reduce the pricing available to them, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare third-party logistics business in both the United States and Europe also is characterized by intense competition from a number of international, regional and local companies, including large conventional logistics companies and internet based non-traditional competitors that are moving into the healthcare and pharmaceutical distribution business. This competitive market places continuous pricing pressure on us from customers and manufacturers that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to continue to increase our revenues and to offset margin reductions caused by pricing pressures through cost control measures.\nWe have significant concentration in and dependence on Group Purchasing Organizations and certain healthcare provider customers.\nIn 2016, our top ten customers in the United States represented approximately 27% of our consolidated net revenue. In addition, in 2016, approximately 81% of our consolidated net revenue was from sales to member hospitals under contract with our largest group purchasing organizations (GPO): Vizient, Premier and HPG. We could lose a significant healthcare provider customer or GPO relationship if an existing contract expires without being replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to its expiration. For example, in April 2016, we announced the loss of our largest IDN customer which had accounted for approximately $525 million of revenue in 2015. Although the termination of our relationship with a given GPO would not necessarily result in the loss of all of the member hospitals as customers, any such termination of a GPO relationship, or a significant individual healthcare provider customer relationship, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating earnings are partially dependent on certain significant domestic suppliers.\nIn the United States, we distribute products from nearly 1,100 suppliers and are dependent on these suppliers for the continuing supply of products. In 2016, sales of products of our ten largest domestic suppliers accounted for approximately 56% of consolidated net revenue. In the Domestic segment, sales of products supplied by Medtronic, Becton Dickinson and Johnson & Johnson accounted for approximately 13%, 9% and 9% of our consolidated net revenue for 2016, respectively. We\nrely on suppliers to provide agreeable purchasing and delivery terms and performance incentives. Our ability to sustain adequate operating earnings has been, and will continue to be, partially dependent upon our ability to obtain favorable terms and incentives from suppliers, as well as suppliers continuing use of third-party distributors to sell and deliver their products. A change in terms by a significant supplier, or the decision of such a supplier to distribute its products directly to healthcare providers rather than through third-party distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to adequately integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn connection with our growth strategy, we from time to time acquire other businesses that we believe will expand or complement our existing businesses and operations. The integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, which may include but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nExpenses and difficulties in the transition and integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nRetention of current customers and the ability to obtain new customers;\n\u2022\nThe assimilation and retention of personnel, including management personnel, in the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nAccounting, tax, regulatory and compliance issues that could arise;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in implementing uniform controls, procedures and policies in our acquired companies, or in remediating control deficiencies in acquired companies not formerly subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated expenses incurred or charges to earnings based on unknown circumstances or liabilities;\n\u2022\nFailure to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition at the pace we anticipate;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which the acquired businesses operate; and\n\u2022\nDifficulties encountered in conducting business in markets where we have limited experience and expertise.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete and integrate our strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business, growth strategies and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur global operations increase the extent of our exposure to the economic, political, currency and other risks of international operations.\nOur global operations involve issues and risks, including but not limited to the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nLack of familiarity with and expertise in conducting business in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nForeign currency fluctuations and exchange risk;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in foreign regulations or conditions relating to labor, economic or political environment, and social norms or requirements;\n\u2022\nAdverse tax consequences and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad;\n\u2022\nLocal economic environments, such as in the European markets served by Movianto and ArcRoyal, including recession, inflation, indebtedness, currency volatility and competition; and\n\u2022\nChanges in trade protection laws and other laws affecting trade and investment, including import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries.\nOur operations are also subject to risks of violation of laws that prohibit improper payments to and bribery of government officials and other individuals and organizations. These laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, any violation of which could result in substantial liability and a loss of reputation in the marketplace. Failure to comply with these laws also could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanging conditions in the United States healthcare industry may impact our results of operations.\nWe, along with our customers and suppliers, are subject to extensive federal and state regulations relating to healthcare as well as the policies and practices of the private healthcare insurance industry. In recent years, there have been a number of government and private initiatives to reduce healthcare costs and government spending. These changes have included an increased reliance on managed care; reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; a shift in healthcare provider venues from acute care settings to clinics, physician offices and home care; and the development of larger, more sophisticated purchasing groups. All of these changes place additional financial pressure on healthcare provider customers, who in turn seek to reduce the costs and pricing of products and services provided by us. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly and these potential changes, which may include a reduction in government support of healthcare services, adverse changes in legislation or regulations, and further reductions in\nhealthcare reimbursement practices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent regulatory and licensing requirements.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, Asia and other countries where we operate. We also are required to hold permits and licenses and to comply with the operational and security standards of various governmental bodies and agencies. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any failure to maintain the necessary permits, licenses or approvals, or to comply with the required standards, could disrupt our operations and/or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state laws intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. The requirements of these fraud and abuse laws are complicated and subject to interpretation and may be applied by a regulator, prosecutor or judge in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our business relies on the secure transmission and storage of sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce, and, in certain instances, patient-identifiable health information. We are subject to state, federal and foreign laws that regulate the confidentiality of such information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. Regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. Our failure to maintain the confidentiality of information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to claims, damages, fines and penalties and/or costs for remediation and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nProducts we source, assemble and sell may be subject to recalls and product liability claims.\nCertain of the products that we sell and distribute are sourced and sold under one or more private labels or are assembled by us into custom trays and minor procedure kits. If these products do not function as designed, are inappropriately designed or are not properly produced, we may have to withdraw such products from the market and/or be subject to product liability claims. Although we maintain insurance against product liability and defense costs in amounts believed to be reasonable, there is no assurance that we can successfully defend any such claims or that the insurance we carry will be sufficient. A successful claim against us in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPoor or deteriorating economic conditions in the United States and the other countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for healthcare services and consequently, the demand for our products and services. Poor economic conditions also could lead our suppliers to offer less favorable terms of purchase to distributors, which would negatively affect our profitability. These and other possible consequences of financial and economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us.\nWe provide credit in the normal course of business to customers. We perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintain reserves for credit losses. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of one or more customers with substantial balances due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, and our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyber-attack or other systems breach.\nWe rely on information systems to receive, process, analyze and manage data in distributing thousands of inventory items to customers from numerous distribution and logistics centers. These systems are also relied upon for billings to and collections from customers, as well as the purchase of and payment for inventory and related transactions from our suppliers. In addition, the success of our long-term growth strategy is dependent upon the ability to continually monitor and upgrade our information systems to provide better service to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events (including cyber-attacks) or fail to operate for an extended period of time, or if we fail to appropriately enhance our systems to support growth and strategic initiatives.\nOur distribution and logistics services include acting as the primary billing, order-to-cash and collections function for many of our customers. These services rely on the performance and uptime of our information systems. If our information\nsystems are interrupted, damaged or fail to operate, our customers could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe operate throughout the United States and Europe as well as in China. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed, including but not limited to proposals to repeal LIFO (last-in, first-out) treatment of domestic inventory or changes in tax accounting methods for inventory, import tarriffs and taxes, or other tax items, that could adversely affect our tax positions, tax rate or cash payments for taxes.\nOur business and operations depend on the proper functioning of critical facilities and distribution networks.\nDamage or disruption to our distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, geo-political events or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products and conduct our business. To the extent that we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate within the European Union, including in the United Kingdom and therefore may be affected by United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.\nWe operate within the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), including the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d). On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., and disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent and recent occurrence of these events, we are monitoring the situation but it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal may affect our operations or financial performance.", "PERMNO": 60186, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "OMI"}
