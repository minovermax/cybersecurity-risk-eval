RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply may reduce our net sales and/or margins, which may cause us to incur losses or reduce our net income.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of building products are determined by overall supply and demand in the market. Market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical, and we have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes. Demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, interest rates, availability of mortgage financing, the construction, repair and remodeling markets, industrial markets, weather, and population growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products. To the extent that prices and volumes experience a sustained or sharp decline, our net sales and margins likely would decline as well. Because we have substantial fixed costs, a decrease in sales and margin generally may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many of the building products which we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber, and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other distributors or manufacturers, with prices and volumes determined frequently\nin an auction market based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. At times, the purchase price for any one or more of the products we produce or distribute may fall below our purchase costs, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales.\nAll of these factors make it difficult to forecast our operating results.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness, future indebtedness, or to maintain our required level of excess liquidity.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt which could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our U.S. revolving credit facility is variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt, and therefore may be in a better position to obtain favorable credit terms.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows, and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and demand factors affecting the building products distribution industry;\n\u2022\nexternal factors affecting availability of credit;\n\u2022\npricing pressures;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions; and\n\u2022\nother operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, or restructure our debt. Obtaining additional capital or restructuring our debt could be accomplished in part through new or additional borrowings or placements of debt or securities. There is no assurance that we could obtain additional capital or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on the disposition of such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposition.\nOur obligations under the revolving credit facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our operating subsidiaries, including BlueLinx Building Products Canada Ltd.\u2019s (BlueLinx Canada) (for the Canadian revolving credit facility) inventories, accounts receivable, and proceeds from those items. Furthermore, the equity interest in all of our real estate subsidiaries which hold the real estate secured by our mortgage are subject to first and second priority interests in favor of our lenders, as applicable. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations.\nAs of January 2, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $215.9 million and excess availability of $51.2 million under the terms of the U.S. revolving credit facility. As of January 2, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $2.9 million and excess availability of $1.4 million under the terms of our Canadian revolving credit facility. In addition, our mortgage loan is secured by the majority of our real property. As amended on March 24, 2016, our mortgage loan requires us to make a $60.0 million principal payment due no later than July 1, 2017, and a $55.0 million principal payment due no later than July 1, 2018. Pursuant to the mortgage loan, and except as expressly permitted thereunder, the net proceeds from any owned properties sold by us must be used to pay down mortgage principal, and these proceeds will be included in the aforementioned principal\npayments. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to consummate any disposition of assets or obtain the net proceeds which we could realize from such disposition, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet the debt service obligations then due. In the event of our breach of the revolving credit facilities or our mortgage loan, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets or otherwise exercise their remedies with respect to such interests.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, including requiring us to maintain a minimum level of excess liquidity.\nOur revolving credit facilities and mortgage loan contain various restrictive covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants customary for asset-based loans that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental business changes.\nAs amended by the Eleventh and Twelfth Amendments (the \u201cAmendments\u201d) to the U.S. revolving credit facility, the U.S. revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 in the event our excess availability under the U.S. revolving credit facility falls below a defined range, adjusted on a seasonal basis, of $35.0 million to $39.0 million; and the amount equal to 12.5% of the lesser of (a) the sum of the borrowing base and the Tranche A borrowing base or (b) the Maximum Credit as defined in the U.S. revolving credit facility. If we fail to maintain this minimum excess availability, the U.S. revolving credit facility requires us to (i) maintain certain financial ratios, which we would not meet with current operating results, and (ii) limit our capital expenditures, which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the U.S. revolving credit facility, the Canadian revolving credit facility, the mortgage loan documents, or any other current or future financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt, and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.\nWhile we operate our business out of 44 warehouse facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our warehouse facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, or by fire, adverse weather conditions, or other unexpected events or disruptions to our facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and operating results will be reduced.\nThe building products distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. Competitive factors in our industry include pricing and availability of product, service, and delivery capabilities; customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors for their products, and affects the favorability of the terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers.\nSome of our competitors are part of larger companies, and therefore have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. In addition, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers. Additional manufacturers of products distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute directly to end-users in the future or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our costs at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and net income will be reduced.\nA significant percentage of our employees are unionized. Wage increases or work stoppages by our unionized employees may reduce our results of operations.\nAs of January 2, 2016, we employed approximately 1,600 persons. Approximately 36% of our employees were represented by various labor union collective bargaining agreements, of which approximately 16% are up for renewal in fiscal 2016. Although we have generally had good relations with our unionized employees, and expect to renew collective bargaining agreements as they expire, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to reach a timely agreement as to the renewal of the agreements, and their expiration or continued work under an expired agreement, as applicable, could result in a work stoppage. In addition, we may become subject to material cost increases, or additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions. The foregoing could increase our selling, general, and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future, which could adversely impact our net sales and/or selling, general, and administrative expenses. All of these factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits, such as pension benefits, could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nUnfavorable changes in the cost of our pension retirement benefits could materially adversely impact our financial results and cash flow. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering many of our hourly unionized employees. Our estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans are based upon various assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, projected return on plan assets, compensation increase rates, mortality rates, retirement patterns, and turnover rates. In addition, the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations are influenced by funding requirements that are established by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Pension Protection Act, Congressional Acts, or other governing bodies.\nWe also participate in various multi-employer pension plans in the U.S. Some of these plans are underfunded. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from these plans, we likely would need to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results.\nAffiliates of Cerberus control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders.\nCerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cCerberus\u201d), a private investment firm, beneficially owned approximately 52.7% of our common stock as of January 2, 2016. As a result, Cerberus is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. This concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that some of our stockholders may not view as beneficial.\nTwo of our eight directors are employees of or current advisors to Cerberus. Cerberus also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. The interests of Cerberus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, Cerberus is in the business of making investments in companies, and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus may also pursue, for its own account, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Cerberus continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, because we are a controlled company within\nthe meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules, we are exempt from the NYSE requirements that our board be composed of a majority of independent directors, that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors, and that we maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors.\nEven if Cerberus no longer controls us in the future, certain provisions of our charter documents and agreements and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 30 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series; and\n\u2022\nlimit the stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which also imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. Further, certain of our incentive plans provide for vesting of stock options and/or payments to be made to our employees in connection with a change of control, which could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nWe are subject to information technology security risks and business interruption risks, and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs information technology systems and a website that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information. We also employ information technology systems to secure other confidential information, such as employee data. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. As cyber attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions, and/or obtain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant upon information technology systems to place orders with our vendors and process orders from our customers. Disruption in these systems could materially impact our ability to buy and sell our products.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\nOn July 29, 2015, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, which is the minimum average share price for continued listing on the NYSE. Delisting would have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and, as a result, the market price for our common stock might decline. Delisting could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. We intend to take actions designed to bring our stock price within the required compliance levels within the NYSE\u2019s specified time frame, as the Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split, subject to shareholder approval at our 2016 Annual Meeting, to seek to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirement.\nAdditionally, on January 26, 2016, we received notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with NYSE listing standards because our average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50 million, and, at the same time, our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million. We timely notified the NYSE of our plan, and subsequently timely submitted a plan advising the NYSE of the definitive actions that we intend to take to regain conformity with this NYSE listing standard within an 18 month cure period. Within 45 days of the submission of this plan, the NYSE will determine whether we have made a reasonable demonstration of an ability to conform to the relevant standards within the cure period. If the NYSE accepts our plan, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to our compliance with other continued listing standards, and we will be subject to quarterly monitoring by the NYSE for compliance with the plan. There can be no assurance that the NYSE will accept our plan, or that our plans to regain compliance will be successful.", "PERMNO": 90496, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "BXC"}
