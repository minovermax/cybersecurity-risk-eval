{"cik": "38984", "company": "Real Industry, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are in addition to risks that apply to most businesses and are not the only ones we face. The order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight, likelihood or importance. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Real Industry as a Holding Company\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to acquire and integrate businesses that perform and meet expectations after closing. A key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition and integration of profitable operating businesses. We may experience challenges identifying, financing, consummating and integrating such acquisitions. Competition exists in the market for the acquisition of profitable operating companies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms, as suitable financing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nEven if we are successful in completing additional acquisitions, these could require significant investments of capital, management attention, and integration effort. We may also encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems of acquired companies, and retaining key personnel. These risks are applicable even for businesses we intend to run on a stand-alone basis. We recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we may incur additional significant goodwill impairment charges in the future. Acquisitions could disrupt relationships with existing customers, suppliers, and strategic partners of the newly acquired entities and may create other contractual, intellectual property, or employment issues. The acquisition of another company or business may also require us to enter into a business, industry or geographic market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation and increase our operating costs, and these challenges could be magnified as the size of the acquisition increases.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions or that, if consummated, we will successfully integrate the businesses or otherwise realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. Even if we are able to grow and build our operations, any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or for other assets we sell. We may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill and customer relationships from our acquisitions. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested annually or upon the occurrence of certain events that indicate that the assets may be impaired. Definite-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of certain events that indicate that the assets may be impaired. We may not receive the recorded value for our intangible assets if we sell or liquidate our business or assets.\nBased on our 2016 goodwill impairment test, we identified and recorded a $61.8 million impairment charge in our RANA segment. Following the impairment charge, we have $42.2 million of goodwill, including $33.6 million in RANA, which is subject to further impairment. In addition, we impaired the remaining $0.1 million of Cosmedicine\u2019s unamortized product formulations. The remaining $12.5 million of unamortized customer relationships with definite lives as of December 31, 2016, will continue to be amortized. We incurred total amortization expenses relating to these intangible assets of $2.4 million in 2016. These expenses will reduce our future earnings or increase our future losses. Should additional impairment charges be recognized in the future, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we may from time to time decide to sell operating subsidiaries or assets based on any number of factors, including a desire to monetize an asset to finance working capital or other strategic plans or because such operations may not perform as expected. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing such future transactions. If such a transaction is completed, it may reduce the size of our business or our cash flow. There is also no assurance that we will receive adequate consideration in the disposition of any operating subsidiary or asset. As a result, any future disposition of operating subsidiaries or assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have experienced substantial losses from continuing operations in recent years and may experience losses in the future. Although we reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of NABCO\u2019s operations (which are classified in discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016), for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we reported losses from continuing operations of $103.2 million, $31.7 million, $0.1 million, $14.2 million, $7.4 million and $9.9 million, respectively. While we believe we made significant progress in reducing our operating costs at corporate since summer 2013, following the sale of NABCO and the consummation of the Real Alloy Acquisition, the nature of our operations and our operating costs have changed significantly. The Real Alloy Acquisition has not yet been accretive to earnings, and unless its financial performance improves, it may cause additional dilution to our earnings per share. We may experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which could make it difficult to fund our operations, finance acquisitions and achieve our business plan, any of which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur debt agreements as of December 31, 2016 and future debt financing arrangements into which we or our subsidiaries may enter, may contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests. Failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial results. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $368.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes, the Asset-Based Facility, a $1.5 million term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), and various capital leases, which was entirely related to Real Alloy. Further, Real Alloy has additional borrowing capacity under the Asset-Based Facility and its German subsidiary\u2019s \u20ac50 million nonrecourse Factoring Facility. Interest costs related to this indebtedness, together with the dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock, are substantial. The Senior Secured Notes, the Asset-Based Facility, the Factoring Facility and the Redeemable Preferred Stock contain, and the instruments governing our other future indebtedness may contain, certain customary restrictions, covenants, and provisions for mandatory repayment upon the occurrence of certain events, and provisions for events of default that will require us, Real Alloy or other acquired entities to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, restrict the ability to engage in specified types of transactions, and otherwise limit the distributions of funds from Real Alloy or other entities acquired in the future to us. This overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022\nlimit the ability to pay dividends or management fees, to make distributions or to repay intercompany loans, especially from Real Alloy, and future subsidiaries, to us;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy obligations under the terms of this indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability to refinance this indebtedness on terms acceptable to Real Alloy, us, or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit the flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we or Real Alloy operate and increase the vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow to make interest and principal payments on this indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow to distribute to us or to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrict sales of key assets;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability to substantially change our business or enter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or acquisitions or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; or\n\u2022\ncause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes and Asset-Based Facility and certain other indebtedness require us or could require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions and tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios, conditions and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under any such financing arrangement, the relevant lenders could assess increased interest rates, accelerate the maturity of the debt or foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt, and events of default could be triggered under other financing arrangements with cross-default provisions. In this event, we may lack sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, any limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt or to take other actions could significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nOur ability to use our U.S. NOLs to offset future U.S. taxable income may be limited as a result of past events, the Real Alloy Acquisition, the financings related to the Real Alloy Acquisition, or as the result of future acquisitions, financings or other issuances or transfers of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we reported U.S. NOLs of approximately $916.0 million, which will begin to expire if not used before the tax year ending December 31, 2027. For accounting purposes, a valuation allowance is required to reduce our potential deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income. As a result of uncertainties about the timing and amount of future U.S. taxable income, we have a full valuation allowance of $400.6 million recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, and expect to continually review and evaluate the valuation allowance in future periods.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing U.S. NOLs could be limited or eliminated as a result of changes in U.S. federal tax laws and regulations or should we: i) be found by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to not be able to avail ourselves of Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code in connection with the plan of reorganization following the Bankruptcy Proceedings; ii) undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as described under Section 382 of the Tax Code; iii) be deemed to have abandoned an active business; or iv) not return to profitability or be only marginally profitable in the future.\nAlthough we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that, as of Fremont\u2019s emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings through the Real Alloy Acquisition until the present time, Real Industry has met the criteria under Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code to be able to utilize its U.S. NOLs to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs, however, will be subject to significant limitation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the Company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code. For this purpose, an \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value, over a rolling three-year period. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership, which would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs. Separately, any changes to tax rules or the interpretation of tax rules could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our U.S. NOLs.\nWhile there is no guarantee that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that the Real Alloy Acquisition and related financings did not result in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. The Company received an opinion letter (the \u201cSection 382 Opinion Letter\u201d) from its U.S. tax counsel, Blank Rome LLP, substantially to the effect that the Real Alloy Acquisition and related financings should not result in an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that the Company may use its U.S. NOLs to offset future U.S. taxable income generated by Real Alloy. The Section 382 Opinion Letter is restricted to the precise terms described therein and the Company or its stockholders may engage in subsequent transactions that would result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d Additionally, the Company adopted the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision in order to protect stockholder value by preserving our U.S. NOLs. There is no guarantee, however, that the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision will be effective in protecting our U.S. NOLs and other tax assets.\nThe amount of our U.S. NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our U.S. NOLs and other tax assets, which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes in the future. Further, our U.S. NOLs only have value to the extent we generate U.S. taxable income. If we are unable to generate U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the U.S. NOLs, or if we are only marginally profitable during such period, we will be limited in our ability to utilize the tax benefits related to our U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient U.S. taxable income to be able to utilize our U.S. NOLs prior to their expiration. Finally, the use of U.S. NOLs is subject to various tax laws and regulations and any changes in such or the interpretations thereof.\nFunding for our future acquisitions and operations could increase our liabilities, trigger negative tax consequences or dilute, or rank preferentially to, our stockholders. We intend to fund any future acquisition through a mix of our available cash, the sale of equity securities in private placements or in registered offerings under our shelf registration statement declared effective on October 21, 2015, rights offerings to existing stockholders, and debt financings. Utilizing these funding sources can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial capital commitments, loss of some of our U.S. NOLs, or dilution. Any of these events could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe currently have 9,235,000 shares of blank check preferred stock available for issuance and $700.0 million of securities available for issuance under the shelf registration statement. In order to fund our future operations or acquisitions, we may sell preferred equity securities or convertible debt securities with rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders. In such event, future security holders could be entitled to dividends, liquidation or other transaction preferences, or voting rights that are not provided to our existing common stockholders. Further, with or without preferential terms, future issuances of securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur Redeemable Preferred Stock issued as partial consideration in the Real Alloy Acquisition has superior rights to our common stock. In connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition, we issued $25.0 million, or 25,000 shares, of Series B Non-Participating Preferred Stock of Real Industry (the \u201cRedeemable Preferred Stock\u201d) to Aleris to be held in an escrow to secure Aleris\u2019 indemnification obligations in connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition. The Redeemable Preferred Stock generally has no voting rights, except, among other customary matters, for any merger (unless the Redeemable Preferred Stock remains outstanding or is purchased at the liquidation preference), for any acquisition valued at more than 5% of the consolidated assets of the Company (so long as at least $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Redeemable Preferred Stock remain outstanding). We currently pay quarterly dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock at a rate of 8% per annum, which will increase to 9% in August 2017; after being payable in-kind for the first two years, dividends are payable in cash. Other than dividends or distributions payable on our common stock in shares of common stock, the Redeemable Preferred Stock ranks superior to our common stock in the payment of accrued and accumulated dividends, declaration and payment of new dividends and distributions, and making of redemptions. The Redeemable Preferred Stock could have a material impact on the rights of our common stockholders in terms of dividends, repurchases and redemptions by, or in the event of a liquidation of, the Company.\nReal Industry\u2019s operations staff is lean, and we depend on key personnel to achieve our business and strategic objectives. As a holding company that seeks to identify, acquire and maintain operating companies with functioning management teams and operational support departments, Real Industry maintains a more lean management and operations team. The size of this staff may limit how many strategic and operations opportunities that we may pursue in depth at any given time. In addition, we may from time to time need to consult with third party strategic, financial, legal or other business advisors in order to assess and pursue operational matters, strategic objectives, transactions or financings, which may increase our general and administrative expense.\nFurther, we depend on the members of our senior management team to execute our business plan and strategy and to manage our business and day-to-day operations, including identifying, structuring, closing and monitoring business acquisitions. These members of our senior management team have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely upon to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, it may take us significant time, effort and cost to identify and hire suitable executives with the appropriate experience and expertise to join the Company, and in the meantime, we may not be able to operate our business or identify and manage our business as we planned. As a result, our ability to compete could be harmed. All of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have certain continuing indemnity obligations in connection with the NABCO Sale. In connection with the sale of NABCO in January 2015, we and SGGH each entered customary indemnification obligations related to our representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the survival period for most of these indemnification obligations has terminated, but certain indemnification obligations, including for environmental, tax, employee and employee benefits matters, remains. While the indemnification is capped at an aggregate of $7.8 million for breaches of most representations and warranties, certain other indemnification obligations are not limited. Should a significant claim arise, we could be required to pay a material amount of our available cash to fund or address any such indemnified liability, including the costs of negotiating or defending claims from the purchasers of NABCO or third-parties and the final costs of the underlying liability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we experience other material weaknesses in our system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis and may not be able to detect fraud, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and our common stock price. As disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2015, our CEO and CFO identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting pertaining to control deficiencies in our financial close process. This specifically related to the accounting for the Real Alloy Acquisition, including the lack of effective oversight and review of various analyses and reconciliations, and the inability to meet external financial reporting deadlines. The material weakness was caused by the significant level of activity related to accounting for the Real Alloy Acquisition, the integration of the Real Alloy Business, a manual consolidation process, and the complexity of the Real Alloy Acquisition and the associated purchase accounting.\nAs described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we took steps to remediate a number of the aspects of this material weakness; however, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015, as our process to account for the Real Alloy Acquisition, a 2015 event, was not remediated by year-end. Notwithstanding the material weakness in 2015, our CEO and CFO concluded that the unaudited quarterly financial information for 2015, included in this Annual Report, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our CEO and CFO have determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.\nIf we fail to maintain or enhance our internal control over financial reporting or fail to properly maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to detect fraud or to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis. The existence of any such deficiencies and/or weaknesses, even if cured, could also lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock. Such deficiencies or material weaknesses may also subject us to litigation, investigations and other penalties.\nIn addition, our business strategy contemplates the further acquisition of businesses and the operation of subsidiaries whose financial results will be consolidated into our financial statements and reporting. We maintain an operations staff at a lean level that we believe is appropriate for our current business. However, this environment could result in future challenges with our business combination process, as we experienced with the Real Alloy Acquisition. Additionally, as a result of these business activities and our future growth, the scope of our internal control over financial reporting will have to expand, which may subject us to increased internal control risks, especially as new businesses are integrated into our processes. Effective internal control over financial reporting must be established and maintained in connection with these acquisitions, if any, in order for us to produce accurate and timely financial reports. Failure to do so would result in our inability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, and possibly lead to other deficiencies, which would likely have a negative impact on the market value of our common stock.\nFurthermore, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act currently requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report. We are also subject to the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not be able to complete the work required for such attestations on a timely basis and, even if we timely complete such requirements, we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The inability to obtain such attestation could lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and may impair our ability to raise capital under our $700.0 million shelf registration statement.\nOur holding company organizational structure makes Real Industry largely dependent on funding from and highly subject to the risks and uncertainties of its operating subsidiaries. This holding company structure may not provide the benefits we expect. Real Industry is a holding company with no current business operations of its own. Beyond the companies that we have either formed or acquired, Real Industry\u2019s only significant assets are our cash and our equity interests in and our obligations from our subsidiaries. As a result, we largely rely on funding from Real Alloy, and may in the future largely rely on our other operating subsidiaries, to meet our obligations. If our subsidiaries need to retain their funds to meet their financial obligations or experience other restrictions on their ability to fund Real Industry, that may limit our access to funds, available working capital, or ability to pursue our acquisition strategy or other strategic objectives.\nWhile we intend to operate Real Alloy and other future operating subsidiaries largely as stand-alone businesses, to the extent that we operate operating subsidiaries that are substantially larger entities than our holding company, we are subject to the business, industry, geographic, and market risks, regulations and uncertainties of such subsidiaries. The impact of these may be significant to Real Industry and could have a negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nFurther, we completed the Reincorporation and our past acquisitions to establish and maintain a holding company organizational structure, and we plan to make future acquisitions within this structure, because of the strategic, business and financing flexibility that we believe it affords us. Our holding company structure may not keep the assets and liabilities of the Company and any new businesses we acquire legally separate. In such case, the increased costs of maintaining a separate holding company, including the administrative costs and expenses associated with keeping separate records and separate corporate or regulatory filings, may be incurred without realizing the possible benefits.\nChanges in the tax provisions that are applicable to the Company or our subsidiaries may create additional tax liabilities for us, may reduce our NOLs, increase tax analysis and compliance costs and trigger other consequences with a material effect on our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities are based on the distribution of income across these jurisdictions. The determination of the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, there may be changes in U.S. tax policy, and the nature and outcome of those potential changes is uncertain at this time. Given the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome of the U.S. tax reform, it is not possible to predict the impact any changes would have on the Company\u2019s financial results. If there is a change in, re-interpretation of or re-application of, these tax regulations in ways that are applicable to our operations and businesses, our tax liabilities and tax compliance costs could materially increase.\nPending legal proceedings and other contingent liabilities may impact our financial condition and results of operations, lowering our stock price, and limiting our ability to use our common stock as consideration in future transactions. Our subsidiary, SGGH, is subject to a number of lawsuits seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief and it has potential other contingent liabilities, including repurchase claims, which relate to Fremont\u2019s prior businesses and are presented in discontinued operations. For a summary of our material legal proceedings, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. Additional litigation may be filed against us, or our subsidiaries, or disputes may arise in the future concerning matters involving the discontinued operations. We and SGGH have been and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all legal proceedings in which we are involved, however, the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the costs to defend SGGH or the Company in these matters may be significant. In turn, these could have a material impact on the price of our common stock, which may limit our ability to utilize our common stock as consideration for potential future acquisitions and other transactions in which we may engage.\nSGGH has received repurchase claims relating to certain residential mortgage loans sold by our discontinued operations, and may receive additional claims in the future that, unless withdrawn or settled within the limits of the established repurchase reserve, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, SGGH had $101.7 million of outstanding repurchase claims associated with claims of breaches of certain representations and warranties related to the residential real estate loans sold by Fremont Investment & Loan (\u201cFIL\u201d), largely from 2002 through 2007. While management believes no repurchase reserve liability is appropriate as of December 31, 2016, the amount of the reserve is subjective and is based on management\u2019s current expectations based on facts currently known.\nAlthough the last mortgage loan purchase agreement was executed in mid-2007, there is no certainty that other claims will not also be asserted against SGGH or us. Changing or new facts and circumstances could cause us to increase the repurchase reserve in future periods or may cause us to experience losses in excess of any repurchase reserve liability. Any material increase in, or change in the nature of, repurchase claim activity and payout amounts, the repurchase reserve, or changes in our ability to object to, defend or settle such claims, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 19-Discontinued Operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for additional information about the repurchase reserve.\nSGGH is subject to residential mortgage-backed securities defense, indemnity and contribution claims. In connection with residential mortgage-backed securities offerings (\u201cRMBS Offerings\u201d) involving loans originated by FIL, either or both of FIL and its subsidiary entered into mortgage loan purchase agreements, underwriting agreements, and indemnification and contribution agreements, which contained various representations and warranties relating to the loans. Investment banks involved in these RMBS Offerings have been sued in a number of actions concerning their activities related to subprime mortgages (\u201cRMBS Actions\u201d), where neither FIL, nor its subsidiary, are a named defendant. FIL and its subsidiary have received demands for defense, indemnity and contribution from defendants in various RMBS Actions. Each of these demands has been rejected as we believe the demanding parties are being sued for conduct not chargeable to FIL or its subsidiary. There is no assurance that FIL or its subsidiary will not be named as a defendant in additional RMBS Actions or receive additional demands for defense, indemnity and contribution. We intend to vigorously defend any claims seeking defense, indemnity or contribution, but we cannot presently predict whether such claims will be pursued or what the outcome would be. However, if the investment banks suffer losses in connection with RMBS Actions and successfully pursue claims against FIL, its subsidiary or SGGH, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber-security threats, giving unauthorized persons access to and the ability to misappropriate our customer data, and proprietary business information. In our operations, we store and transmit proprietary information for ourselves and for our customers. We have offices, operations and employees in various locations throughout the U.S., Europe, Canada and Mexico. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or an interruption of our networks that has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, although we attempt to validate the security of such services, because of vendors that use cyber or \u201ccloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third-parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our attractiveness as a business partner could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nCompliance with laws or regulations governing our current or future operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. We and Real Alloy are subject to statutes and regulations at the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign level, as may be any entity we acquire. The inability to comply with these statutes and regulations in the business segments, geographic regions and jurisdictions in which we, Real Alloy or future subsidiaries operate could result in substantial costs, including fines, civil penalties, and criminal sanctions or costs associated with upgrades to improve facilities or changes in manufacturing or other processes in order to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, which could, depending on their magnitude, individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price. Further, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, potentially with retroactive effect, any of which could harm us, our operations, our plans and our stockholders. We may seek to acquire new businesses subject to legislation or regulations with which we are not currently familiar. Compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes to laws and regulations or entering into new regulated industries may cause us to alter our operations or business strategy in order to minimize the adverse impact on our business and financial performance or to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences in the strategies and plans set forth in this Annual Report. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Real Alloy\nThe cyclical nature of the metals industry, Real Alloy\u2019s end-use segments, and the industries of Real Alloy\u2019s customers could limit operating flexibility and could negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The metals industry is generally cyclical in nature. It tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general macro and local economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the level of economic growth, financing availability, the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, and demand for automobiles and housing. Historically, in periods of recession or periods of minimal economic growth, metals companies have tended to underperform other sectors. Real Alloy is particularly sensitive to trends in the automobile industry, which can be seasonal, highly cyclical, and dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, during recessions or periods of low growth, the automobile industry typically experiences major cutbacks in production, resulting in decreased demand for inputs such as aluminum. This may lead to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for Real Alloy\u2019s products and services. Because Real Alloy generally has certain fixed costs, its near-term profitability can be significantly affected by decreased processing volume. Accordingly, reduced demand and pricing pressures may significantly reduce its profitability and adversely affect its financial condition. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a prolonged recession in its principal industry segments have had a negative impact on the operations of Real Alloy and could have a negative impact on Real Alloy\u2019s future financial condition or results of operations. In addition, global economic and commodity trends have been increasingly correlated in recent years. Although Real Alloy will continue to seek to diversify its business on a geographic and industry end-use basis, there can be no assurance that diversification will significantly mitigate the effect of cyclical downturns.\nReal Alloy requires substantial amounts of capital to operate; failure to maintain sufficient liquidity will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy requires substantial amounts of capital to operate, and its liquidity can be adversely affected by a number of factors outside its control. Fluctuations in aluminum prices, even at modest levels, may result in increased cash costs for aluminum scrap, and increase the need for working capital. In addition, if aluminum price movements result in a negative valuation of current financial derivative positions, counterparties may require the posting of cash collateral. Furthermore, in an environment of falling aluminum prices, the borrowing base and availability under Real Alloy\u2019s then-current borrowing facilities may shrink and constrain Real Alloy\u2019s liquidity. If Real Alloy fails to maintain adequate liquidity, ratings agencies could downgrade Real Alloy, Real Alloy\u2019s suppliers could change the commercial terms on which they are willing to sell to Real Alloy (including requiring quick pay terms) or otherwise reduce the level of business they are willing to do with Real Alloy, and credit insurers could cut the level of insurance they will extend, further impacting liquidity and forcing Real Alloy to use more cash to conduct its operations. While Real Alloy monitors these liquidity levels closely and would endeavor to work closely with ratings agencies and its lenders and suppliers to address tight liquidity issues, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to address a material liquidity issue should one arise.\nReal Alloy requires substantial capital investments that it may be unable to fulfill. The operations of Real Alloy are capital intensive. Under Aleris, total capital expenditures were $60.5 million, $55.7 million, $37.4 million and $31.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount was approximately $30.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively, including $26.0 million spent under Real Industry\u2019s ownership in the year ended December 31, 2015. Real Alloy may not generate sufficient operating cash flows and its external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable it to make anticipated capital expenditures, service or refinance indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If Real Alloy is unable to make upgrades or purchase new equipment, its financial condition and results of operations could be affected by higher maintenance costs, lower sales volumes due to the impact of reduced product quality, and other competitive influences.\nThe loss of certain members of the management team of Real Alloy may have an adverse effect on its operating results. The success of Real Alloy will depend, in part, on the efforts of senior management and other key employees. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial, and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of its business. If Real Alloy loses or suffers an extended interruption in the services of one or more of its senior officers, its financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. Moreover, the pool of qualified individuals may be highly competitive and Real Alloy may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of senior management or other key employees, should the need arise.\nReal Alloy may be unable to effectively manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and its hedging activities may affect profitability in a changing metals price environment and subject its earnings to greater volatility from period-to-period. Significant increases in the price of primary aluminum, aluminum scrap, alloys, hardeners, commodity inputs, or energy would cause the cost of sales for Real Alloy to increase significantly and, if not offset by product price increases, would negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy is a substantial consumer of raw materials, and by far the largest input cost in producing its goods is the cost of aluminum and aluminum scrap. In the case of buy/sell arrangements, customers pay for products based on the indexed prices or based on a fixed price. Under tolling arrangements, customers pay Real Alloy a processing fee. In general, Real Alloy uses these pricing mechanisms to pass changes in the price of aluminum and aluminum scrap, and, sometimes, energy, through to its customers. Buy/sell arrangements may require Real Alloy to purchase raw materials in future periods, exposing it to the risk that increased aluminum or energy prices will increase the cost of its products, thereby reducing or eliminating the margin Real Alloy receives when it delivers the product. These risks may be exacerbated by the failure of customers to pay for products on a timely basis, or at all.\nSimilarly, as Real Alloy maintains substantial quantities of raw material and finished goods inventories, significant decreases in the price of aluminum and aluminum scrap would reduce the realizable value of its inventory, negatively affecting its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a drop in aluminum prices between the date of purchase and the final settlement date on derivative contracts used to mitigate the risk of price fluctuations may require Real Alloy to post additional margin, which, in turn, can be a significant demand on liquidity.\nReal Alloy purchases and sells LME forwards, futures and options contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in aluminum prices in its European operations. The ability to realize the benefit of a hedging program is dependent upon factors beyond its control, such as counterparty risk, as well as its receiving timely payments from customers. The cost of energy used, however, is also substantial. In addition, at certain times, hedging options may be unavailable or not available on terms acceptable to Real Alloy. In certain scenarios when market price movements result in a decline in value of its current derivatives position, its mark-to-market expense may exceed its credit line and counterparties may request the posting of cash collateral. Despite the use of LME forwards, futures and options contracts, Real Alloy remains exposed to the variability in prices of aluminum scrap. While aluminum scrap is typically priced in relation to prevailing aluminum index prices (LME, Platts, Metal Bulletin, etc.), certain scrap types used in Real Alloy\u2019s operations are not highly correlated to an underlying index and, therefore, are not hedged. Aluminum scrap is also priced at a discount to selling prices. This discount is referred to in the industry as the \u201cscrap spread\u201d and fluctuates depending upon industry conditions. In addition, Real Alloy purchases forwards, futures or options contracts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices. It does not account for forwards, futures, or options contracts as hedges of the underlying risks. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as current period earnings or loss. The inclusion of such unrealized gains and losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of underlying operating performance.\nReal Alloy may encounter increases in the cost, or limited availability, of raw materials and energy, which could cause the cost of sales to increase thereby reducing operating results and limiting operating flexibility. Real Alloy requires substantial amounts of raw materials and energy in its business, consisting principally of aluminum scrap, primary aluminum, alloys, and other materials, and natural gas and electricity. Any substantial increases in the cost of raw materials or energy could cause operating costs to increase and negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAluminum scrap, primary aluminum, and hardener prices are subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations. Metallics (primary aluminum metal, aluminum scrap, and aluminum dross) represent the largest component of cost of sales. Real Alloy purchases aluminum primarily from aluminum scrap dealers, primary aluminum producers and other intermediaries. Real Alloy has limited control over the price or availability of these supplies.\nThe availability and price of aluminum scrap depends on a number of factors outside of the control of Real Alloy, including general economic conditions, international demand for metallics and internal recycling activities by primary aluminum producers and other consumers of aluminum. Increased regional and global demand for aluminum scrap can have the effect of increasing the prices that Real Alloy pays for these raw materials thereby increasing the cost of sales. Real Alloy may not be able to adjust its selling prices to recover the increases in aluminum scrap prices. If aluminum scrap and dross prices were to increase significantly without a commensurate increase in the traded value of the primary metals or of the indices on which sales are made, the future financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy could be affected by higher costs and lower profitability. In addition, a significant decrease in the pricing spread between aluminum scrap and primary aluminum could make recycling less attractive compared to primary production, and thereby reduce customer demand for Real Alloy\u2019s recycling services.\nAfter raw material and labor costs, energy represents the third largest component of the cost of sales. The price of natural gas, and therefore the costs, can be particularly volatile. Price and volatility can differ by global region based on supply and demand, political issues, and government regulation, among other things. As a result, Real Alloy\u2019s natural gas costs may fluctuate dramatically, and it may not be able to reduce the effect of higher natural gas costs on its cost of sales. If natural gas costs increase, Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Although Real Alloy attempts to mitigate volatility in natural gas costs through the use of hedging and the inclusion of price escalators and pass-through mechanisms, it may not be able to eliminate the effects of such cost volatility. Furthermore, in an effort to offset the effect of increasing costs, it may have also limited its potential benefit from declining costs.\nIf Real Alloy were to lose order volumes from any of its largest customers, its revenues, earnings, and cash flows could be reduced. Real Alloy is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. Its ten largest customers were responsible for approximately 46% and 58% of its volume invoiced for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, with one customer accounting for approximately 12% in 2016, and one customer accounting for approximately 13% of those volumes in 2015. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy by lowering sales volumes and lowering profitability. In addition, Real Alloy\u2019s strategy of having dedicated facilities and arrangements with customers subject it to the inherent risk of increased dependence on a single or a few customers with respect to these facilities. In such cases, the loss of such a customer, or the reduction of that customer\u2019s business at one or more of its facilities, could negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations, and Real Alloy may be unable to timely replace, or replace at all, lost order volumes. Certain Real Alloy customers have decided to reduce their dependence on single suppliers and have reduced the volume of their orders from Real Alloy. In addition, several of Real Alloy\u2019s customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to Real Alloy in the last ten years. Similar incidents in the future would adversely impact the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy does not have long-term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of its customers, and sales volumes and revenues could be reduced if those customers switch their suppliers. A substantial amount of Real Alloy\u2019s volume is sold to customers under contractual arrangements of one year or less or on a purchase order basis. Customers may choose not to continue to purchase products and services from Real Alloy. Any significant loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material negative impact on the sales volume and business of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy may not be able to compete successfully in the industries it serves and secondary aluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce Real Alloy\u2019s share of industry sales, sales volumes, and selling prices. Aluminum competes with other materials such as steel, plastic, composite materials, and glass for various applications, and recycled aluminum may also compete with prime aluminum. Higher aluminum prices tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials. Lower aluminum prices can make prime aluminum more attractive than secondary aluminum in certain applications.\nReal Alloy competes with other aluminum recyclers in segments that are highly fragmented and characterized by smaller, regional operators. The principal factors of competition in the aluminum recycling business include price, metal recovery rates, proximity to customers, customer service, molten metal delivery capability, environmental and safety regulatory compliance, and types of services offered. Many of Real Alloy\u2019s customers also have the capability to recycle scrap and may choose to bring more of their recycling volumes within their own operations.\nWith its international business, Real Alloy encounters the risk that non-U.S. governments could take actions to enhance local production or local ownership at its expense. Recently, there have been increased volumes of prime aluminum from China.\nAdditional competition could result in a reduced share of industry sales or reduced prices for Real Alloy\u2019s products and services, which could decrease revenues or reduce volumes, either of which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal Alloy has been shaped by acquisitions, including the Beck Acquisition, and divestitures under former owners, and we will continue to evaluate future acquisitions and divestitures. Future acquisitions or divestitures may not be successful, which could adversely affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition. The future financial performance and success of Real Alloy will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its business strategy on a stand-alone basis. Part of the business strategy for Real Alloy has been, and will continue to be, the opportunistic pursuit of strategic acquisitions and dispositions. However, there can be no assurance that any such growth efforts will be successful, or that if successful, Real Alloy will be able to effectively manage expanded or acquired operations. The ability of Real Alloy to achieve its expansion and acquisition needs and objectives and to effectively manage its growth depends on numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the following:\n\u2022\nits ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate new businesses into Real Alloy\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital on acceptable terms to finance acquisitions (including in light of the terms of the indebtedness under the financings related to the Real Alloy Acquisition);\n\u2022\nthe ability to generate the cost savings or synergies anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on Real Alloy\u2019s operational systems; and\n\u2022\nthe amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, the process of integrating new businesses could cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the existing Real Alloy business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of new businesses or divestiture of existing businesses could negatively impact Real Alloy and its results of operations. Furthermore, any acquisition could result in significant increases in outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. The terms of this indebtedness may further limit Real Alloy\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions.\nFurther aluminum industry consolidation could impact Real Alloy. The aluminum industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years, and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although recent industry consolidation has not negatively impacted Real Alloy, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.\nA portion of Real Alloy\u2019s sales is derived from international operations, which exposes Real Alloy to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad. Real Alloy has aluminum recycling operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Norway and Canada and magnesium recycling operations in Germany. Real Alloy\u2019s international operations generally are subject to risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, trade restrictions and laws, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in the United Kingdom and Germany, and export controls and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises or government policies favoring local production;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u2022\ncurrency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\ndiffering protections for intellectual property and enforcement thereof;\n\u2022\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could cause costs to rise, limit growth opportunities or have a negative effect on Real Alloy\u2019s operations and ability to plan for future periods, and subject it to risks not generally prevalent in the U.S.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of the operating entities of Real Alloy are reported in local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in its and Real Industry\u2019s consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of U.S. dollars against these currencies, generally, may have a negative impact on reported revenues and operating profit, and the resulting accounts receivable, while depreciation of U.S. dollars against these currencies, generally, may have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit. In addition, a portion of the revenues generated by its international operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the majority of costs incurred are denominated in local currencies. As a result, appreciation in the U.S. dollar may have a positive impact on earnings while depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on earnings.\nImpairment of Real Alloy\u2019s intangible assets could result in significant charges that could adversely impact future operating results. Real Alloy has significant intangible assets, which are susceptible to impairment charges as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets are goodwill and customer relationships, all of which are related to business combinations. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed fair value. We assess finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated balance sheets included $12.5 million of identifiable intangible assets, net and $42.2 million of goodwill, which reflects a $61.8 million goodwill impairment charge in 2016. As a result of the Real Alloy Acquisition, both intangible assets and goodwill have increased substantially. Adverse changes in the operations of the Real Alloy business or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge in future periods that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in that period.\nCurrent environmental liabilities as well as the cost of compliance with, and liabilities under, health and safety laws could increase the operating costs of Real Alloy and negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy\u2019s operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites, and employee health and safety. Future environmental regulations could impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which Real Alloy operates. Additional pollution control equipment, process changes, or other environmental control measures may be needed at some of its facilities to meet future requirements.\nReal Alloy\u2019s financial liability for contaminated property can include the cost of investigating and remediating contaminated soil or ground water, fines and penalties sought by environmental authorities, and damages arising out of personal injury, contaminated property and other toxic tort claims, as well as lost or impaired natural resources. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for certain kinds of matters, such that a person can be held liable without regard to fault for all of the costs of a matter even though others were also involved or responsible. Further, any future remedial requirements at currently owned or operated properties or adjacent areas could also result in significant liabilities. In addition, any failure by Real Alloy to operate within the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or environmental permits could lead to, among other things, a shutdown of a portion or all of a facility, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement could materially increase costs. For example, if salt cake, a by-product of aluminum recycling operations, were to become classified as a hazardous waste in the U.S., the costs to manage and dispose of it would increase and could result in significant increased expenditures.\nIn June 2016, Norwegian regulatory authorities required Real Alloy to suspend its salt slag processing facility in Norway due to odor emissions from the facility. The authorities have asserted that odor emissions from the facility were in excess of permitted levels. Although Real Alloy is working diligently to remedy this matter as quickly as possible to enable Real Alloy\u2019s salt slag processing facility in Norway to resume operations, there can be no assurance that operations of this facility will resume in the near future, if at all. Any permanent shutdown of this facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nReal Alloy could experience labor disputes that could disrupt its business. Approximately 22% of Real Alloy employees in North America and substantially all of the employees located in Europe, where union membership is common, are represented by unions or equivalent bodies and are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. Although Real Alloy believes they will successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements when the current agreements expire, these negotiations may not prove successful, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption or cessation of its operations.\nNew government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues may subject Real Alloy to significant new costs and restrictions on its operations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide, including recently announced, long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments by the U.S. and China. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are legislative and regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions, including the European Union, which would institute a cap-and-trade system, covering various sectors of the economy, under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where Real Alloy has manufacturing plants, are considering greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of these plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity derived from various sources, and natural gas. Greenhouse gas or other clean air or environmental regulations could increase the price of the electricity and natural gas that Real Alloy purchases, restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require Real Alloy to purchase allowances to offset its emissions, prompt significant capital expenditures to mitigate emissions, or result in an overall increase in the cost of raw materials. Any one of these developments could significantly increase Real Alloy\u2019s costs, reduce its competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect its business, operations or financial results. While future emissions regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict specifically how such regulation might affect Real Alloy\u2019s business, operations, or financial results.\nThe profitability of Real Alloy depends, in part, on the availability of an adequate source of raw materials. Real Alloy depends on aluminum scrap for its operations and acquires its aluminum scrap from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell aluminum scrap to us. In periods of low industry prices, suppliers may elect to hold aluminum scrap waiting for higher prices. In addition, the slowdown in industrial production and consumer consumption in the U.S. and Europe during past economic crises may have reduced the supply of aluminum scrap available to Real Alloy. Further, exports of aluminum scrap out of North America and Europe can negatively impact availability and scrap spreads. If an adequate supply of aluminum scrap is not available, Real Alloy would be unable to recycle metals at desired volumes and its results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe operations of Real Alloy present significant risk of injury or death. It may be subject to claims that are not covered by or exceed its insurance. Because of the heavy industrial activities conducted at its facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to employees and visitors of Real Alloy, notwithstanding the safety precautions taken. These operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. While Real Alloy has policies in place to minimize such risks, it may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed insurance coverage and may have a material adverse effect on Real Alloy\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy\u2019s operations and on the cost of its hedging activities. Real Alloy uses over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives products to hedge its metal commodity and natural gas risks and, historically, currency risks. Legislation in Europe and the U.S. has been adopted to increase the regulatory oversight of the OTC derivatives markets and impose restrictions on certain derivative transactions, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. As a result of the regulation of the derivatives market under the Dodd-Frank Act, the parties with whom we enter into hedging transactions are subject to heightened requirements, and they could pass along their increased regulatory compliance burden in the form of higher costs or tighter the costs of hedging. Additional rules and regulations pursuant to this legislation are likely to be adopted and not all compliance dates have been reached. If future rules and regulations subject Real Alloy to additional capital or margin requirements, reduce the number of eligible derivatives counterparties, or impose other restrictions on its trading and commodity positions, they could have an adverse effect on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy and on the costs of its hedging activities.\nCertain German pension and benefit obligations of Real Alloy are currently underfunded. Real Alloy may have to make significant cash payments to certain German pension plans, which would reduce the cash available for its business and have an adverse effect on its business financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Since Fremont emerged from the Bankruptcy Proceedings in June 2010, the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock has varied significantly, from $2.31 per share in the second quarter of 2012 to $14.10 in the third quarter of 2013. During 2016, our stock price traded from $5.30 to $9.63 per share. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the reaction of stockholders, securities analysts and the market generally to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. The factors affecting the market for our shares in the past may not be the same as the factors affecting the market for our share going forward. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges or variations in earnings and/or operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete acquisitions on a timely and cost-effective basis, and generate the expected benefits from such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchallenges to our U.S. NOLs or any inability to fully utilize our U.S. NOLs prior to their expiration;\n\u2022\nshortfalls in operating revenues or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected;\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe terms of future acquisitions or dispositions, and the businesses, industries, risks and uncertainties applicable to such acquired entities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt, whether or not in connection with future acquisition activity;\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders and shifts in our ownership that could result in our not being able to maximize the value of our U.S. NOLs;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing accounting principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions and increased costs of compliance;\n\u2022\nthe commencement or outcome of material litigation involving the Company, our subsidiaries, or the industries in which we have exposure, or both;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market volatility, economic trends and other external factors.\nWe and our predecessors have not paid cash dividends since 2006 and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We are a holding company that does not operate any business that is separate from those of our subsidiaries. We are therefore dependent on our subsidiaries for any funds from which to pay dividends. We and our predecessors have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of 2006, and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Rather, we expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business.\nIn addition, our future cash dividends would be limited by the terms of certain of the financings related to the Real Alloy Acquisition and the Redeemable Preferred Stock. Because we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, holders of our common stock will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates, which we cannot assure.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws and our Rights Agreement could discourage, delay, prevent, or deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Each of our Rights Agreement and the Tax Benefit Preservation Provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that were adopted to prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Tax Code and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs. Each has the effect of limiting beneficial ownership of our common stock to 4.9% (5.0% in the case of our Rights Agreement) without approval of our Board of Directors. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for us, which may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nOur Rights Agreement expires by its terms in October 2017. If a subsequent Rights Agreement is not adopted, we will need to rely on the Tax Benefit Preservation Provisions alone to monitor and limit ownership changes in our stock that could trigger losses of our U.S. NOLs.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s possible departure from the European Union could adversely affect us. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (also referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The referendum was advisory, and by the terms of the Treaty on European Union, any withdrawal is subject to a negotiation period that could last up to two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates the withdrawal process. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us are difficult to predict, but because we currently have a plant located within the United Kingdom, in Wales, and we have plants located within Europe, in Norway and Germany, the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to our businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and suppliers, as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each other\u2019s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.", "PERMNO": 37699, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "ELLH"}
