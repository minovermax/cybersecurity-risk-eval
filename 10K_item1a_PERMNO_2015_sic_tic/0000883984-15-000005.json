{"cik": "883984", "company": "ICU MEDICAL INC/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn evaluating an investment in our common stock, investors should consider carefully, among other things, the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report and our other reports and registration statements filed with the SEC.\nUnexpected changes in our arrangements with Hospira may cause a decline in our sales and could result in a significant reduction in our sales and profits.\nWe depend on Hospira for a high percentage of our sales and earnings. Worldwide sales to Hospira were 36%, 39% and 42% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nUnder the terms of our agreements with Hospira, we are dependent on the marketing and sales efforts of Hospira for a large percentage of our sales, and Hospira determines the prices at which the products that we sell to Hospira will be sold to its customers. Hospira has conditional exclusive rights to sell Clave and our other products as well as custom infusion systems under the SetSource program in many of its major accounts. If Hospira is unable to maintain its position in the marketplace, our sales and operations could be adversely affected.\nIn 2014 and 2013, U. S. Hospira substantially reduced its purchases of our infusion therapy products, resulting in a reduction in 2014 sales compared to 2013 and 2013 sales compared to 2012. If Hospira continues to reduce orders, we could experience lower sales and earnings in future years compared to 2014.\nOur ability to maintain and increase our market penetration depends in significant part on the success of our arrangement with Hospira and Hospira\u2019s arrangements with major buying organizations and its ability to renew such arrangements, as to which there is no assurance. Our business could be materially adversely affected if Hospira terminates its arrangement with us, negotiates lower prices, sells competing products or increases its sales of competing products, whether manufactured by Hospira or others, or otherwise alters the nature of its relationship with us. Although we believe that Hospira views us as a source of innovative and profitable products, there is no assurance that our relationship with Hospira will continue in its current form.\nIn contrast to our dependence on Hospira, our principal competitors in the market for protective infusion connection systems are much larger companies that dominate the market for infusion products and have broad product lines and large internal distribution networks. In many cases, these competitors are able to establish exclusive relationships with large hospitals, hospital chains, major buying organizations and home healthcare providers to supply substantially all of their requirements for infusion products. In addition, we believe that there is a trend among individual hospitals and alternate site healthcare providers to consolidate into or join large major buying organizations with a view to standardizing and obtaining price advantages on disposable medical products. These factors may limit our ability to gain market share through our independent dealer network, resulting in continued concentration of sales to and dependence on Hospira.\nWe expect that Hospira will continue to be one of our most important customers, particularly with respect to our Clave products and custom infusion systems. With respect to these products, we remain dependent on our continued relationship with Hospira as well as Hospira\u2019s position in the marketplace. We can provide no assurances that our relationship with Hospira will not change, resulting in adverse effects on sales and operations. In February 2015, it was announced that Pfizer is in the process of acquiring Hospira. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2015. Our expectation is that there will be no change in our relationship with Hospira and our agreements with them survive the transaction.\nWe are increasingly dependent on manufacturing in Mexico and Slovakia and could be adversely affected by any economic, social or political disruptions.\nWe continue to expand our production in Mexico and Slovakia. Any political or economic disruption in Mexico or Slovakia or a change in the local economies could have an adverse effect on our operations. In 2014, production costs were approximately $101.3 million in Mexico and approximately $22.5 million in Slovakia. Most of the material we use in manufacturing is imported into Mexico and Slovakia, and substantially all of the products we manufacture in Mexico and Slovakia are exported. We depend on our ability to move goods across borders quickly. Any disruption in the free flow of goods across national borders could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed 1,355 people in operations and product development in our plant in Ensenada, Mexico and 238 people in operations in our plant in Vrable, Slovakia. Business activity in the Ensenada area has expanded significantly, providing increased employment opportunities. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire\nor retain necessary personnel and result in an increase in labor rates. We continue to take steps to compete for labor through attractive employment conditions and benefits, but there is no assurance that these steps will continue to be successful or that we will not face increasing labor costs in the future.\nAdditionally, political and social instability resulting from violence in certain areas of Mexico has raised concerns about the safety of our personnel. These concerns may hinder our ability to send domestic personnel abroad and to hire and retain local personnel. Such concerns may require us to have security for personnel traveling to our Mexico facility or to conduct more operations from the United States rather than Mexico, which may negatively impact our operations and result in higher costs and inefficiencies.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions which affect our customers\u2019 ability to buy our products and could affect our relationships with our suppliers.\nDisruptions in financial markets worldwide and other worldwide macro-economic challenges may cause our customers and suppliers to experience cash flow concerns. If job losses and the resulting loss of health insurance and personal savings cause individuals to forgo or postpone treatment, the resulting decreased hospital use could affect the demand for our products. As a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change terms of sales. Additionally, if customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law introducing comprehensive health insurance and healthcare reforms in the United States. Among the provisions of such legislation that may have an adverse impact on us is a 2.3% excise tax imposed on medical device manufacturers for the sale of certain medical devices to United States customers. The excise tax, which became effective January 1, 2013, resulted in $1.9 million of additional expense in 2014 and $1.8 million of additional expense in 2013 recorded in Selling, General and Administrative expenses. The ultimate implementation of any healthcare reform legislation, and its impact on us, is impossible to predict. Any significant reforms made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our information systems against security breaches, service interruptions, or misappropriation of data could disrupt operations, compromise sensitive data, and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe depend heavily on information technology infrastructure and systems to achieve our business objectives. Any incident that impairs or compromises this infrastructure, including security breaches, malicious attacks or more general service interruptions, could impede our ability to process orders, manufacture and ship product in a timely manner, protect sensitive data and otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could result in the loss of customers, revenue, or both, and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including legal claims or proceedings. Further, as cyber security related incidents continue to evolve, and regulatory focus on these issues continues to expand, additional investment in protective measures, and vulnerability remediation, may be required.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our internal growth or growth through acquisitions of companies, assets or products, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to expand our marketing and distribution capability, which may include external expansion through acquisitions both in the United States and foreign markets. We may also consider expanding our product offerings through acquisitions of companies or product lines. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems.\nWe have built additional production facilities outside the United States, to reduce labor costs and eliminate transportation and other costs of shipping finished products from the United States and Mexico to customers outside North\nAmerica. The expansion of our manufacturing, marketing, distribution and product offerings both internally and through acquisitions or by contract may place substantial burdens on our management resources and financial controls. Decentralization of assembly and manufacturing could place further burdens on management to manage those operations and maintain efficiencies and quality control.\nThe increasing burdens on our management resources and financial controls resulting from internal growth and acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, acquisitions may involve a number of special risks in addition to the difficulty of integrating cultures and operations and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, including adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results, dependence on retention, hiring and training of key personnel, risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets, some or all of which could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to defend and enforce our patents, if our products are found to infringe patents owned by others or if the cost of patent litigation becomes excessive or as our key patents expire.\nWe have patents on certain products, software and business methods, and pending patent applications on other intellectual property and inventions. There is no assurance, however, that patents pending will issue or that the protection from patents which have issued or may issue in the future will be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar devices, that such patents, if challenged, will be upheld by the courts or that we will be able to prove infringement and damages in litigation.\nWe are substantially dependent upon the patents on our proprietary products to prevent others from manufacturing and selling products similar to ours. We generally have multiple patents covering various features of a product, and as each patent expires, the protection afforded by that patent is no longer available to us, even though protection of features that are covered by other unexpired patents may continue to be available to us. The loss of patent protection on certain features of our products may make it possible for others to manufacture and sell products with features similar to ours, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf others choose to manufacture and sell products similar to or substantially the same as our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business through loss of unit volume or price erosion, or both, and could adversely affect our ability to secure new business.\nIn the past, we have faced patent infringement claims related to the Clave, the CLC2000 and Tego. We believe these claims had no merit, and all have been settled or dismissed. We may also face claims in the future. Any adverse determination on these claims related to the Clave or other products, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time we become aware of newly issued patents on medical devices which we review to evaluate any infringement risk. We are aware of a number of patents for infusion connection systems that have been issued to others. While we believe these patents will not affect our ability to market our products, there is no assurance that these or other issued or pending patents might not interfere with our right or ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Patent infringement litigation, which may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others, can be expensive and may involve a substantial commitment of our resources which may divert resources from other uses. Adverse determinations in litigation or settlements could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or could fail to prevent competitors from manufacturing products similar to ours. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business.\nExpiring patents may affect our future sales.\nMost of our products are covered by patents that, if valid, give us a degree of market exclusivity during the term of the patent. The legal life of a patent in the United States is 20 years from application. Our patents will expire at various dates through 2032. Upon patent expiration, our competitors may introduce products using the same technology. As a result of this possible increase in competition, we may need to reduce our prices to maintain sales of our products, which would make them less profitable. If we fail to develop and successfully launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products, our sales and profits with respect to those products could decline significantly. We may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products before these and other patents expire.\nDamage to any of our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to produce our products.\nA severe weather event, other natural or man-made disaster, labor difficulties, political unrest or any other significant disruption affecting one of our manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a single manufacturing facility for our Clave products located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our Salt Lake City facility also produces other components on which our manufacturing operations in Mexico and Slovakia rely.\nIn 2010, our Slovakia plant was severely flooded from unusually high levels of rainfall that resulted in a delay in opening this plant for production and required extensive repairs to the facility and machinery.\nDamage to any of our facilities could render us unable to manufacture our products or require us to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility.\nWe are dependent on single and limited source suppliers which subjects our business and results of operations to risks of supplier business interruptions.\nAlthough we have risk mitigation plans in place with key suppliers, we have materials (such as resins) that are critical to our ability to manufacture our products, the supply of which is currently from a sole supplier. We cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of materials that we require or satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. Although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials, we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and manufacture of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nExpansion of our manufacturing facilities may result in inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced significant production inefficiencies following a large increase in production volume in Mexico and the transfer of San Clemente production to Salt Lake City. In 2007, we expanded our Mexico facility and, anticipating further increases in volume at that facility, increased the workforce. An additional expansion of our Mexico facility was completed in January 2011. Turnover among new employees is unusually high in Mexico, and the additional time spent in classroom training and on the job training could create production inefficiencies in Mexico in the future. The addition of new products will require additional molding in Salt Lake City and manual assembly work in Mexico and Slovakia. In 2010, we started product shipments from our new plant in Slovakia to customers in Europe. Expansions of our production capacity will require significant management attention to avoid inefficiencies of the type experienced in 2006, and the effect of any inefficiencies can be particularly expensive in Salt Lake City because of the high fixed costs in this highly automated facility.\nBecause we are dependent on Clave products for a major portion of our sales, any decline in sales of Clave products could result in a significant reduction in our sales and profits.\nWe depend heavily on sales of Clave products, especially sales of Clave products to Hospira, which decreased $12.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Most of our sales of Clave products are in the United States. Future sales increases for Clave products may depend on increases in sales of custom infusion systems, expansion in the international markets or acquisition of new customers in the United States. We cannot give any assurance that sales of Clave products will increase or that we can sustain current profit margins on Clave products indefinitely.\nWe believe that the success of the Clave has motivated, and will continue to motivate, competitors to develop one piece needleless connectors. If other manufacturers successfully develop and market effective products that are competitive with Clave products, Clave sales could decline, we could lose market share, and we could encounter sustained price and profit margin erosion.\nBecause we operate in international markets, we are subject to political and economic risks that we do not face in the United States.\nWe operate in a global market. Global operations are subject to risks, including political and economic instability, general economic conditions, imposition of government controls, the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and United States export laws, trade restrictions and the greater difficulty of administering business overseas. As our operations and sales located in Europe and other areas outside the United States increase, we may face new challenges and uncertainties, although we can give no assurance that such operations and sales will increase.\nInternational sales pose additional risks related to competition with larger international companies and established local companies, our possibly higher cost structure, our ability to open foreign manufacturing facilities that can operate profitably and higher credit risk.\nWe have undertaken an initiative to increase our international sales, and have distribution arrangements in all the principal countries in Western Europe, the Pacific Rim, Middle East, Latin America, Canada and South Africa. We plan to sell in most other areas of the world. We export most of our products sold internationally from the United States, Mexico and Slovakia. Our principal competitors in international markets consist of much larger companies as well as smaller companies already established in the countries into which we sell our products. Our cost structure is often higher than that of our competitors because of the relatively high cost of transporting product to some local markets as well as our competitors\u2019 lower local labor costs in some markets. For these reasons, among others, we expect to open manufacturing facilities in foreign locations. There is no certainty that we will be able to open local manufacturing facilities or that those facilities will operate on a profitable basis.\nOur international sales are subject to higher credit risks than sales in the United States. Many of our distributors are small and may not be well capitalized. Payment terms are relatively long. The European hospitals tend to be significantly slower in payment which has resulted in an increase to our days sales outstanding from previous years. Our prices to our international distributors, outside of Europe, for product shipped to the customers from the United States or Mexico are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, but their resale prices are set in their local currency. A decline in the value of the local currency in relation to the U.S. dollar may adversely affect their ability to profitably sell in their market the products they buy from us, and may adversely affect their ability to make payment to us for the products they purchase. Legal recourse for non-payment of indebtedness may be uncertain. These factors all contribute to a potential for credit losses.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors. The related sales agreements may provide for payments in a foreign currency. Accordingly, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the dollar value of foreign-currency denominated revenue and expense increases, and when the dollar strengthens against these currencies, the dollar value of foreign-currency denominated revenue and expense decreases. We are exposed to foreign currency risk on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are currently with the Euro and Mexican Peso against the U.S. dollar.\nWe currently do not hedge against our foreign currency exchange rate risks and therefore believe our exposure to these risks may be higher than if we entered into hedging transactions, including forward exchange contracts or similar instruments. If we decide in the future to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to attempt to reduce the risk related to foreign currency exchange rates, these contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under these contracts. In addition, these types of contracts may themselves cause financial harm to us and have inherent levels of counter-party risk over which we would have no control.\nContinuing pressures to reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our prices. If we cannot reduce manufacturing costs of existing and new products, our sales may not grow and our profitability may decline.\nIncreasing awareness of healthcare costs, public interest in healthcare reform and continuing pressure from Medicare, Medicaid, group purchasing organizations and other payers to reduce costs in the healthcare industry, as well as increasing competition from other protective products, could make it more difficult for us to sell our products at current prices. In the event that the market will not accept current prices for our products, our sales and profits could be adversely affected. We believe that our ability to increase our market share and operate profitably in the long term may depend in part on our ability to reduce manufacturing costs on a per unit basis through high volume production using highly automated molding and assembly systems. If we are unable to reduce unit manufacturing costs, we may be unable to increase our market share for Clave products or may lose market share to alternative products, including competitors\u2019 products. Similarly, if we cannot reduce unit manufacturing costs of new products as production volumes increase, we may not be able to sell new products profitably or gain any meaningful market share. Any of these results would adversely affect our future results of operations.\nIncreased competition in our critical care product line resulted in management's decision to decrease our average selling prices on all critical care products. The price reductions went into effect in the middle of 2011 with the goal of retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. We can provide no assurances that customers will purchase products from us. Continued price pressures could reduce our ability to effectively compete in this market.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully on the basis of product innovation, quality, convenience, price and rapid delivery with larger companies that have substantially greater resources and larger distribution networks than us, we may be unable to maintain market share, in which case our sales may not grow and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe market for infusion products is intensely competitive. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon continued product innovation, the quality, convenience and reliability of our products, access to distribution channels, patent protection and pricing. The ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our products based on safety features, product quality, cost effectiveness, ease of use and convenience, as well as our ability to perceive and respond to changing customer needs. We encounter significant competition in our markets both from large established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies. Many of these firms have introduced competitive products with protective features not provided by the conventional products and methods they are intended to replace. Most of our current and prospective competitors have economic and other resources substantially greater than ours and are well established as suppliers to the healthcare industry. Several large, established competitors offer broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining full-line contracts with a significant number of hospitals and group purchasing organizations to supply all of their infusion product requirements. There is no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase resources devoted to the development, manufacture and marketing of products competitive with our products. The successful implementation of such a strategy by one or more of our competitors could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with new products or alternative technologies developed by others, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers, and our ability to grow our business would be impaired.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances, which places our products at risk of obsolescence. Our long-term success and profit margins depend upon the development and successful commercialization of new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications of our technology. The research and development process is time-consuming and costly, and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize. We can give no assurance that any such new products will be successful or that they will be accepted in the marketplace.\nThe high level of competition and group purchasing organizations place pressure on our profit margins and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe disposable medical device segment of the health care industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is experiencing both horizontal and vertical consolidation. The high level of competition in our industry places pressure on profit margins. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we have. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHealth care reform and the related pressure to contain costs have led to the advent of group purchasing organizations in the United States. These group purchasing organizations enter into preferred supplier arrangements with one or more manufacturers of medical products in return for price discounts to members of the group purchasing organizations. If we are not\nable to obtain new preferred supplier commitments from major group purchasing organizations or retain those commitments that we currently have, which are generally terminable by either party for any reason upon the expiration of a defined notice period, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. However, even if we are able to obtain and retain preferred supplier commitments from group purchasing organizations, they may not deliver high levels of compliance by their members, meaning that we may not be able to offset the negative impact of lower per-unit prices or lower margins with increases in unit sales or in market share.\nIf demand for our products were to decline significantly, we might not be able to recover the cost of our expensive automated molding and assembly equipment and tooling, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur production tooling is relatively expensive, with each \u201cmodule,\u201d which consists of an automated assembly machine and the molds and molding machines which mold the components, costing several million dollars. Most of the modules are for the Clave product family. If the demand for these products changes significantly, which could happen with the loss of a customer or a change in product mix, it may be necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge for the value of the production tooling because its cost may not be recovered through production of saleable product, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have been and will be ordering production molds and equipment for our new products. We expect to order semi-automated or fully automated assembly machines for other new products in 2015. If we do not achieve significant sales of these new products, it might be necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge for the value of the production tooling because its costs may not be recovered through production of saleable product, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf we cannot obtain additional custom tooling and equipment on a timely basis to enable us to meet demand for our products, we might be unable to increase our sales or might lose customers, in which case our sales could decline.\nWe expanded our manufacturing capacity substantially in recent years, and we expect that continued expansion may be necessary. Molds and automated assembly machines generally have a long lead-time with vendors, often nine months or longer. Inability to secure such tooling in a timely manner, or unexpected increases in production demands, could cause us to be unable to meet customer orders. Such inability could cause customers to seek alternatives to our products.\nIncreases in the cost of petroleum-based and natural gas-based products or loss of supply could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nMost of the materials used in our products are resins, plastics and other material that depend upon oil or natural gas as their raw material. Crude oil markets are affected by political uncertainty in the Middle East, and there is no assurance that crude oil supplies will not be interrupted in the future. Any such interruption could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce, or the cost to produce, our products. Also, crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile in recent years. Our suppliers have historically passed some of their cost increases on to us, and if such prices are sustained or increase further, our suppliers may pass further cost increases on to us. In addition to the effect on resin prices, transportation costs have increased because of the effect of higher crude oil prices, and we believe most of these costs have been passed on to us. Our ability to recover these increased costs may depend upon our ability to raise prices on our products. In the past, we have rarely raised prices and it is uncertain that we would be able to raise them to recover higher prices from our suppliers. Our inability to raise prices in those circumstances, or to otherwise recover these costs, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the management and leadership of our executive team, as well as other members of our senior management team. If one or more of these individuals were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, our business would be disrupted and we might not be able to find replacements on a timely basis or with the same level of skill and experience, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nOur ability to market our products in the United States and other countries may be adversely affected if our products or our manufacturing processes fail to qualify under applicable standards of the FDA and regulatory agencies in other countries.\nGovernment regulation is a significant factor in the development, marketing and manufacturing of our products. Our products are subject to clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) under a number of statutes including the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d). Each of our current products has qualified, and we anticipate that\nany new products we are likely to market will qualify for clearance under the FDA\u2019s expedited pre-market notification procedure pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDC Act. However, certain of our new products may require a longer time for clearance than we have experienced in the past and there can be no assurance that a PMA application will not be required. Further, there is no assurance that other new products developed by us or any manufacturers that we might acquire will qualify for expedited clearance rather than a more time consuming pre-market approval procedure or that, in any case, they will receive clearance from the FDA. FDA regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive. Uncertainties as to the time required to obtain FDA clearances or approvals could adversely affect the timing and expense of new product introductions. In addition, we must manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, component suppliers control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products.\nThe FDA has broad discretion in enforcing the FDC Act, and noncompliance with the FDC Act could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from warning letters, product detentions, device alerts or field corrections to mandatory recalls, seizures, injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties. If the FDA determines that we have seriously violated applicable regulations, it could seek to enjoin us from marketing our products or we could be otherwise adversely affected by delays or required changes in new products. In addition, changes in FDA, or other federal or state, health, environmental or safety regulations or in their application could adversely affect our business.\nTo market our products in the European Community (\u201cEC\u201d), we must conform to additional requirements of the EC and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives. As a manufacturer that designs, manufactures and markets its own devices, we must comply with the quality management standards of ISO 13485 (2012). Those quality standards are similar to the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations. Manufacturers of medical devices must also be in conformance with EC Directives such as Council Directive 93/42/EEC (\u201cMedical Device Directive\u201d) and their applicable annexes. Those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the EC. Once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the Medical Device Directive, the \u201cCE\u201d Mark maybe affixed to its devices. The CE Mark gives devices an unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the EC. There is no assurance that we will continue to meet the requirements for distribution of our products in Europe.\nDistribution of our products in other countries may be subject to regulation in those countries, and there is no assurance that we will obtain necessary approvals in countries in which we want to introduce our products.\nProduct liability claims could be costly to defend and could expose us to loss.\nThe use of our products exposes us to an inherent risk of product liability. Patients, healthcare workers or healthcare providers who claim that our products have resulted in injury could initiate product liability litigation seeking large damage awards against us. Costs of the defense of such litigation, even if successful, could be substantial. We maintain insurance against product liability and defense costs in the amount of $10,000,000 per occurrence. There is no assurance that we will successfully defend claims, if any, arising with respect to products or that the insurance we carry will be sufficient. A successful claim against us in excess of insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect us. Furthermore, there is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms.\nWe may be required to implement a costly product recall.\nIn the event that any of our products proves to be defective, we can voluntarily recall, or the FDA or other regulatory agencies could require us to redesign or implement a recall of, any of our products. We believe that any recall could result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future. Though it may not be possible to quantify the economic impact of a recall, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally offer a limited warranty for product returns which are due to defects in quality and workmanship. We attempt to estimate our potential liability for future product returns and establish reserves on our financial statements in amounts that we believe will be sufficient to address our warranty obligations; however, our actual liability for product returns may significantly exceed the amount of our reserves. If we underestimate our potential liability for future product returns, or if unanticipated events result in returns that exceed our historical experience, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Stockholder Rights Plan, provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOn July 15, 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) and, pursuant to the Plan, declared a dividend distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 1997. The Plan expired in 2007 and our Board of Directors adopted an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement in July 2007. Under its current provisions, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior participating Preferred Stock, no par value, at a purchase price of $225 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment. The Plan is designed to afford the Board of Directors a great deal of flexibility in dealing with any takeover attempts and is designed to cause persons interested in acquiring us to deal directly with the Board of Directors, giving it an opportunity to negotiate a transaction that maximizes stockholder values. The Plan may, however, have the effect of discouraging persons from attempting to acquire us.\nInvestors should refer to the description of the Plan in our 2007 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control, including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of Preferred Stock and fix the rights and preferences thereof, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control otherwise desired by the stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile due to many factors.\nThe market for small and mid-market capitalization companies can be highly volatile, and we have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock in the past. From January 2012 through December 2014, our trading price ranged from a high of $87.50 per share to a low of $43.51 per share. We believe that factors such as quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in financial results, differences between stock analysts\u2019 expectations and actual quarterly and annual results, new product introductions by us or our competitors, changing regulatory environments, litigation, changes in healthcare reimbursement policies, sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of common stock by insiders, market rumors and substantial product orders could contribute to the volatility in the price of our common stock. General economic trends unrelated to our performance such as recessionary cycles and changing interest rates may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock; the recent macroeconomic downturn could depress our stock price for some time.\nMost of our common stock is held by, or included in accounts managed by, institutional investors or managers. Several of those institutions own or manage a significant percentage of our outstanding shares, with the ten largest interests accounting for 46% of our outstanding shares at the end of 2014. If one or more of the institutions or if our other large stockholders should decide to reduce or eliminate their position in our common stock, it could cause a significant decrease in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77447, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ICUI"}
