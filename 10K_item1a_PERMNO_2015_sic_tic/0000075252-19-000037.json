{"cik": "75252", "company": "OWENS & MINOR INC/VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that we currently believe could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors are in addition to those mentioned in other parts of this report and are not all of the risks that we face. We could also be affected by risks that we currently are not aware of or that we currently do not consider material to our business.\nWe face competition and accelerating pricing pressure.\nThe medical/surgical supply distribution industry in the United States is highly competitive and characterized by pricing pressure which accelerated in 2017 and continued into 2018 and put further margin pressure on our business. We expect this margin pressure to continue. We compete with other national distributors and a number of regional and local distributors, as well as customer self-distribution models and, to a lesser extent, certain third-party logistics companies. Competitive factors within the medical/surgical supply distribution industry include market pricing, total delivered product cost, product availability, the ability to fill and invoice orders accurately, delivery time, range of services provided, efficient product sourcing, inventory management, information technology, electronic commerce capabilities, and the ability to meet customer-specific requirements. Our success is dependent on the ability to compete on the above factors, while managing internal costs and expenses. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation in response to cost containment legislation and general market pressures to reduce costs. This consolidation of our customers and suppliers generally gives them greater bargaining power to reduce the pricing available to them, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare third-party logistics business in both the United States and Europe also is characterized by intense competition from a number of international, regional and local companies, including large conventional logistics companies and internet based non-traditional competitors that are moving into the healthcare and pharmaceutical distribution business. This competitive market places continuous pricing pressure on us from customers and manufacturers that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to continue to retain and/or grow our revenues and to offset margin reductions caused by pricing pressures through cost control measures.\nWe have significant concentration in and dependence on certain healthcare provider customers and Group Purchasing Organizations.\nIn 2018, our top ten customers in the United States represented approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue. In addition, in 2018, approximately 72% of our consolidated net revenue was from sales to member hospitals under contract with our largest group purchasing organizations (GPO): Vizient, Premier and HPG. We could lose a significant healthcare provider customer or GPO relationship if an existing contract expires without being replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to its expiration. Although the termination of our relationship with a given GPO would not necessarily result in the loss of all of the member hospitals as customers, any such termination of a GPO relationship, or a significant individual healthcare provider customer relationship, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating income is dependent on certain significant domestic suppliers.\nIn the United States, we distribute products from nearly 1,400 suppliers and are dependent on these suppliers for the continuing supply of products. In 2018, sales of products of our ten largest domestic suppliers accounted for approximately 47% of consolidated net revenue. In the Global Solutions segment, sales of products supplied by Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Becton Dickinson accounted for approximately 10%, 7% and 7% of our consolidated net revenue for 2018, respectively. In addition, combined sales of products supplied by Medline Industries and Cardinal Health, both of which are also our competitors, accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated net revenue for 2018. We rely on suppliers to provide agreeable purchasing and delivery terms and performance incentives. Our ability to sustain adequate operating income has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to obtain favorable terms and incentives from suppliers, as well as suppliers continuing use of third-party distributors to sell and deliver their products. A change in terms by a significant supplier, the decision of such a supplier to distribute its products directly to healthcare providers rather than through third-party distributors, or a key supplier\u2019s failure to sell and deliver us products necessary to meet our customers\u2019 demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to adequately integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operation.\nIn connection with our growth strategy, we from time to time acquire other businesses, including recently, the Halyard acquisition (Halyard) and Byram Healthcare (Byram), that we believe will expand or complement our existing businesses and operations. The integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, which may include but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nExpenses and difficulties in the transition and integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nRetention of current customers and the ability to obtain new customers;\n\u2022\nThe assimilation and retention of personnel, including management personnel, in the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nAccounting, tax, regulatory and compliance issues that could arise;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in implementing uniform controls, procedures and policies in our acquired companies, or in remediating control deficiencies in acquired companies not formerly subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated expenses incurred or charges to earnings based on unknown circumstances or liabilities;\n\u2022\nFailure to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition at the pace we anticipate;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which the acquired businesses operate;\n\u2022\nDifficulties encountered in conducting business in markets where we have limited experience and expertise;\n\u2022\nFailure to fully integrate Information Technology;\n\u2022\nInadequate indemnification from the seller; and\n\u2022\nFailure of the seller to perform under the transition services agreement.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete and integrate our strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business, growth strategies and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur global operations increase the extent of our exposure to the economic, political, currency and other risks of international operations.\nOur global operations involve issues and risks, including but not limited to the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nLack of familiarity with and expertise in conducting business in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nForeign currency fluctuations and exchange risk;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in foreign regulations or conditions relating to labor, the economic or political environment, and social norms or requirements;\n\u2022\nAdverse tax consequences and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad;\n\u2022\nLocal economic environments, such as in the European markets served by both the Global Solutions and Global Products business units, including recession, inflation, indebtedness, currency volatility and competition; and\n\u2022\nChanges in trade protection laws and other laws affecting trade and investment, including import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries.\nOur operations are also subject to risks of violation of laws that prohibit improper payments to and bribery of government officials and other individuals and organizations. These laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, any violation of which could result in substantial liability and a loss of reputation in the marketplace. Failure to comply with these laws also could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanging conditions in the United States healthcare industry may impact our results of operations.\nA large percentage of our revenue is derived in the United States. We, along with our customers and suppliers, are subject to extensive federal and state regulations relating to healthcare as well as the policies and practices of the private healthcare insurance industry. In recent years, there have been a number of government and private initiatives to reduce healthcare costs and government spending. These changes have included an increased reliance on managed care; reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; a shift in healthcare provider venues from acute care settings to clinics, physician offices and home care; and the development of larger, more sophisticated purchasing groups. All of these changes place additional financial pressure on healthcare provider customers, who in turn seek to reduce the costs and pricing of products and services provided by us. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly and these potential changes, which may include a reduction in government support of healthcare services, adverse changes in legislation or regulations, and further reductions in healthcare reimbursement practices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent regulatory and licensing requirements.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels in the United States and other countries where we operate. We also are required to hold permits and licenses and to comply with the operational and security standards of various governmental bodies and agencies. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any failure to maintain the necessary permits, licenses or approvals, or to comply with the required standards, could disrupt our operations and/or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAmong the healthcare related laws that we are subject to include the U.S. federal Anti-kickback Statute, the U.S. federal Stark Law, the False Claims Act and similar state laws relating to fraud, waste and abuse. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments), which could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Byram business is a Medicare-certified supplier and participates in state Medicaid programs. Failure to comply with applicable standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nWe collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information, which are subject to federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. Regulations currently in place continue to evolve, and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect, handle and maintain personal or patient information, or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Violations of federal (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA), state or foreign laws (such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, as amended, or GDPR) concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, breach of contract claims, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis we had approximately $1.7 billion of aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness as well as approximately $270 million in obligations under our leasing arrangements and $374.7 million of\nundrawn availability under our credit facilities. Our ratio of total debt to total shareholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 324%.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend upon our financial condition or the condition of the capital markets at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to refinance, extend or repay our substantial indebtedness which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition.\nOur 2021 Notes and our 2024 Notes become due and payable on September 2021 and December 2024, respectively. We anticipate that we will need to raise capital in order to repay the 2021 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 2018, we owed $275 million under our 2021 Notes and $275 million under our 2024 Notes. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital to repay these obligations at maturity and we are otherwise unable to extend the maturity dates or refinance these obligations, we would be in default. Additionally, our Credit Agreement has a \u201cspringing maturity date\u201d with respect to the revolving loans and the term A loans and the term B loans thereunder, that, if as of the date 91 days prior to the maturity date of our 2021 Notes or the 2024 Notes, respectively, all outstanding amounts under the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes, respectively, have not been paid in full, then all amounts due with respect to the revolving loans, the term A loans and the term B loans will become due and payable on the maturity dates of the 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes, respectively. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise the necessary amount of capital to repay these obligations or that we will be able to extend the maturity dates or otherwise refinance these obligations. Upon a default, our lenders would have the right to exercise its rights and remedies to collect, which would include foreclosing on our assets. Accordingly, a default would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur Global Products segment is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur Global Products Segment relies on product inputs, such as polypropylene and nitrile, as well as other commodities, in the manufacture of its products. Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. The ability to hedge commodity prices is limited. Furthermore, due to competitive dynamics, we may be unable to pass along commodity-driven cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, we could experience lower margins and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain borrowings under our credit agreements bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease.\nOur credit facilities and our existing notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility.\nThe indentures that govern our existing notes and our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes include restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur indebtedness; grant liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations; make asset dispositions, restricted payments and investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. Under our credit facilities, we are subject to financial covenants that require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage, including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition and limit our capital expenditures.\nOur credit facilities also contain restrictions on the amount and timing of share repurchase activity. This includes prohibiting share repurchases should a default under the Credit Agreement exist prior to or immediately after any share repurchases.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions or covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. If a default under the credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes is not cured or waived, such default could result in the acceleration of debt or other payment obligations under our debt or other agreements that contain cross-acceleration, cross-default or similar provisions, which could require us to repurchase or pay debt or other obligations prior to the date it is otherwise due.\nOur ability to comply with covenants contained in the credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes and any other debt or other agreements to which we are or may become a party, may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us.\nAn interruption in the ability of the our business to manufacture products may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe manufacture the majority of our products in eight facilities, three in the United States, one each in Thailand, Ireland and Honduras and two in Mexico. If one or more of these facilities experience damage, or if these manufacturing capabilities are otherwise limited or stopped due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including natural disasters, geopolitical events, prolonged power or equipment failures, labor disputes or unsuccessful imports/exports of products as well as supply chain transportation disruptions, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of these manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to obtain key components, raw materials or manufactured products from third parties may have a material adverse effect on our Global Products segment.\nOur Global Products segment depends on the availability of various components, raw materials and manufactured products supplied by others for its operations. If the capabilities of suppliers and third-party manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, that could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or deliver our products and could lead to exposure to regulatory actions. Further, for quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we have purchased from sole suppliers certain components and raw materials such as polymers used in our products, and we expect to continue to purchase these components and raw materials from these sole suppliers. Although there are other sources in the market place for these items, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials due to regulations and requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. The loss of any sole supplier or any sustained supply interruption that affects the ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely or cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with the terms and conditions of Byram\u2019s Corporate Integrity Agreement requires significant resources and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to penalties or excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nPrior to its acquisition by Owens & Minor, Byram entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement beginning April 2016 with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cOIG\u201d). The Corporate Integrity Agreement provides that Byram shall, among other things, establish and maintain a compliance program, including a corporate compliance officer and committee, a code of conduct, comprehensive compliance policies and procedures, training and monitoring, a review process for certain arrangements between Byram and referral sources, a compliance hotline, an open door policy and a disciplinary process for compliance violations. The Corporate Integrity Agreement further provides that Byram shall provide periodic reports to the OIG, complete certain regular certifications and engage an Independent Review Organization to perform reviews of certain arrangements between Byram and referral sources.\nFailing to meet the Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for Byram including monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. In addition, in the event of an uncured material breach or deliberate violation of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results.\nWe may incur product liability losses, litigation liability, product recalls, safety alerts or regulatory action associated with the products that we source, assemble, manufacture and sell which can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the design, assembly, manufacture and marketing of the medical products of the types we sell. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to the products that we source, assemble, manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the relevant surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information.\nIn addition to product liability claims and litigation, an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient associated with our products could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, or suspension or delay of regulatory product approvals or clearances, product seizures or detentions, governmental investigations, civil or criminal sanctions or injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of our products. Any one of these could result in significant costs and negative publicity resulting in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products and harm its reputation. In addition, a recall or injunction affecting our products could temporarily shut down production lines or place products on a shipping hold.\nAll of the foregoing types of legal proceedings and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our business, result in substantial costs or the diversion of management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe must obtain clearance or approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to introducing a new product or a modification to an existing product. The regulatory clearance process may result in substantial costs, delays and limitations on the types and uses of products we can bring to market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new product, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance or approval from the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities. Most major markets for medical products outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical product can be costly and time consuming, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes in products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. We cannot assure you that these clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, once a medical product has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before it may be modified, its labeling changed or marketed for a different use. Medical products are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action. Furthermore, a product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the medical product or issues relating to its application. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed, if at all, realization of product net sales, substantial additional costs and limitations on the types of products we may bring to market or their indicated uses, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and efficiency and productivity gains or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we unveiled our Rapid Business Transformation (RBT) process to reduce expenses, increase efficiency and productivity and add significant operating income (to replace lost margin). Throughout 2017 and 2018, the RBT process identified and implemented initiatives designed to drive better earnings and cash flow through efficiency and productivity gains, expense reduction and diversification of our business. We have transitioned away from using the term \u201cRBT\u201d and now have the initiatives directly managed by our business units and their respective operating plans. However, our expectations pertaining to cost savings and efficiency and productivity increases are inherently estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected or any actual run-rate cost savings or efficiency and productivity gains. A variety of factors could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected cost savings, including, among others, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings programs, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with operating our business and our ability to achieve the efficiencies contemplated by the cost savings initiative. We may be unable to realize all of these cost savings within the expected timeframe, or at all, and we may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize them.\nThese cost savings and efficiency and productivity gains are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are in turn based on our analysis of the various factors which currently, and could in the future, impact our business. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Certain of the assumptions relate to business decisions that are subject to change, including, among others, our anticipated business strategies, our marketing strategies, our product development and licensing strategies and our ability to anticipate and react to business trends. Other assumptions relate to risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including, among others, the economic environment in which we operate, healthcare regulation and other developments in our industry as well as capital markets conditions from time to time. The actual results of implementing the various cost savings and efficiency and productivity initiatives may differ materially from our estimates. Moreover, our continued efforts to implement these cost savings and efficiency and productivity initiatives may divert management attention from the rest of our business and may preclude us from seeking attractive opportunities, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us.\nWe provide credit in the normal course of business to customers. We perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintain reserves for credit losses. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of one or more customers with substantial balances due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment in Fusion5 has not yet generated revenue and may continue to incur losses.\nFusion5 is a new enterprise with limited operating history. In 2018, Fusion5 began managing bundled payment episodes under the BCPI-A program. As of December 31, 2018, Fusion5 had not generated revenue and had incurred losses. Due to the nature of the BPCI-A program and Fusion5\u2019s contracts with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and healthcare providers, the timing of payments to Fusion5 may differ from our expectations. Additionally, changes to the BPCI-A program by CMS with respect to payment timing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business and operations depend on the proper functioning of critical facilities and distribution networks.\nDamage or disruption to our distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, geo-political events or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products and conduct our business. To the extent that we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, and our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyber-attack or other systems breach.\nWe rely on information systems to receive, process, analyze and manage data in distributing thousands of inventory products to customers from numerous distribution and logistics centers. These systems are also relied upon for billings to and collections from customers, as well as the purchase of and payment for inventory and related transactions from our suppliers. In addition, the success of our long-term growth strategy is dependent upon the ability to continually monitor and upgrade our information systems to provide better service to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely\naffected if systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events (including cyber-attacks) or fail to operate for an extended period of time, or if we fail to appropriately enhance our systems to support growth and strategic initiatives.\nIn Europe, our distribution and logistics services include acting as the primary billing, order-to-cash and collections function for many of our customers. These services rely on the performance and upkeep of our information systems. If our information systems are interrupted, damaged or fail to operate, our customers could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPoor or deteriorating economic conditions in the United States and the other countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for healthcare services and consequently, the demand for our products and services. Poor economic conditions also could lead our suppliers to offer less favorable terms of purchase to distributors, which would negatively affect our profitability. These and other possible consequences of financial and economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe operate throughout the United States and other countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed, including but not limited to proposals to repeal LIFO (last-in, first-out) treatment of inventory in the United States or changes in tax accounting methods for inventory, import tariffs and taxes, or other tax items. These and other changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our tax positions, tax rate or cash payments for taxes.\nWe operate within the European Union, including in the United Kingdom and therefore may be affected by the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.\nWe operate within the European Union (the E.U.), including the United Kingdom (the U.K.). The U.K.\u2019s anticipated exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as Brexit) and the resulting significant change to the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U. and with countries outside the E.U. (and the laws, regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them) could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the U.K. and the E.U. and otherwise negatively impact our operations in Europe. The U.K. is currently negotiating the terms of Brexit, with the U.K. due to exit the E.U. on March 29, 2019. In November 2018, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that set out the terms governing the U.K.\u2019s departure, including, among other things, a transition period to allow for a future trade deal to be agreed upon. As the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parliament on January 15, 2019, there is significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the U.K. will leave the E.U. It is possible that Brexit will result in our U.K. and E.U. operations becoming subject to materially different, and potentially conflicting, laws, regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices. Furthermore, in the event the U.K. leaves the E.U. with no agreement (a hard Brexit), there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or countries outside the E.U. Such impacts could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the U.K. and the E.U. reach to provide access to each other\u2019s respective markets.\nOwens & Minor\u2019s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Owens & Minor\u2019s reputation.\nOne of the reasons why customers choose to do business with us and why teammates choose us as a place of employment is the reputation that we have built over many years. To be successful in the future, the Company must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish our brand and lead to adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.\nTraditional distribution relationships are being challenged by online commerce solutions. Such competition will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technology, to continue to provide enhanced service offerings and to continue to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address demands of consumers and customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAudits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods, and tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by\nnon-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign\njurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax\npositions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting\nfrom these initiatives. On December 22, 2017, U.S. government enacted legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have recorded an amount of income tax to reflect the impact of the law change based on management\u2019s interpretation of the new legislation. It continues to remain uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, they can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nRecent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions might harm our future operating results.\nWe have recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. In 2018, we replaced our Chief Executive Officer & President, our Chief Financial Officer and our Executive Vice President - North American Operations. These types of management changes have the potential to disrupt our operations due to the operational and administrative inefficiencies, added costs, increased likelihood of turnover, and the loss of personnel with deep institutional knowledge, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, we must successfully integrate the new executive leadership team members within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in key leadership positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new leadership becomes familiar with our business.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nU.S. GAAP requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. As a result of interim impairment tests performed during 2018, we recorded an impairment loss related to goodwill of $423.1 million. We may be further required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which charge could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in our industry and competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in government or legislation;\n\u2022\nour financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;\n\u2022\nstock repurchases;\n\u2022\nactivism by any single large shareholder or combination of shareholders;\n\u2022\nany future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nany outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.\nIn addition, the NYSE can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NYSE. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 60186, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "OMI"}
