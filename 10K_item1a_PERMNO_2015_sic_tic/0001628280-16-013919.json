{"cik": "1622893", "company": "Journal Media Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, financial condition and/or stock price.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have a limited history operating as a stand-alone, publicly traded company, and limited combined financial statements, on which you can evaluate our performance.\nWe have operated as a combined business and as a stand-alone, publicly traded company since April 1, 2015. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history and limited financial statements as an independent, stand-alone company upon which you can evaluate us. We may not be able to grow or integrate our business as planned and may not be profitable.\nCertain historical financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not indicative of our future results as a stand-alone, publicly traded company.\nThe financial statements and related disclosures (including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to April 1, 2015 are those of our predecessor, Scripps Newspapers, and the historical carve-out financial statements of Scripps Newspapers were created from Scripps\u2019 financial information. Accordingly, the historical carve-out financial information for Scripps Newspapers included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect the Journal newspaper business and, thereby, does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had those businesses been operated as a combined business and a stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods before April 1, 2015. Nor is such information indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future. This is primarily a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe historical Journal newspaper business financial statements are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission guidance are not required to be so included;\n\u2022\nthe historical carve-out financial statements of Scripps Newspapers do not reflect certain changes that occurred in our funding and operations as a result of the separation of Scripps Spinco and Journal Spinco from Scripps and Journal, respectively, on April 1, 2015;\n\u2022\nour financial information prior to April 1, 2015 reflects estimated allocations for services historically provided by Scripps to Scripps Spinco, and these allocations are different from the costs we incur for these services following April 1, 2015; and\n\u2022\nthe historical financial information prior to April 1, 2015 does not reflect certain increased or duplicative costs we incurred in becoming a stand-alone, publicly traded company as of April 1, 2015, such as costs attributable to transition service agreements we have with Scripps, or changes in historical cost structure due to our differing personnel needs, financing activities and operations.\nFor these or other reasons, our future financial performance will be different from the performance implied by the historical carve-out information of Scripps Newspapers to April 1, 2015 presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor additional information about the past financial performance of Scripps Newspapers, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and the historical carve-out financial statements and the accompanying notes of Scripps Newspapers included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe integration of the newspaper businesses of Journal and Scripps is time consuming, may distract our management from operations, and is expensive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are not successful in integrating the newspaper operations of Scripps and Journal, or if the integration is more difficult or costly than anticipated, we may experience disruptions to our operations. A difficult or unsuccessful integration of these businesses would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits include those associated with:\n\u2022\nadverse effects on employees and business relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, processes, procedures and controls of the businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring processes and know-how;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from business concerns.\nWe may not realize the benefits expected by combining the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal into a new publicly traded company and may experience increased costs that could decrease overall profitability.\nBefore the April 1, 2015 newspaper mergers, our business was part of two separate public companies. Following the consummation of the newspaper mergers, we may experience difficulties in integrating the two businesses into one company, and the newspaper mergers may result in increased costs and inefficiencies in our business operations and management. Integration of our businesses may cost significantly more or take longer than anticipated, which could decrease profitability or otherwise impact expected cost-savings. In addition, prior to the newspaper mergers our businesses took advantage of the economies of scale of Scripps and Journal. As a separate, stand\u00adalone, publicly traded company, we may be unable to obtain goods, services and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the newspaper mergers, which could decrease overall profitability. Furthermore, we may not be successful in transitioning from the services and systems provided by Scripps and Journal and may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Failure on our part to realize the anticipated benefits of the newspaper mergers, including, without limitation, the anticipated cost-savings resulting from operating synergies and growth opportunities from combining the businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nRestrictions on our operations, and our obligations to indemnify Scripps and its shareholders in connection with the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers, could materially and adversely affect us.\nCertain tax-related restrictions and indemnities set forth in the tax matters agreements agreed to by Scripps, Journal and us in order to maintain the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers limit our discretion in the operation of our business and could adversely affect us. Under these provisions, we:\n\u2022\nhave generally undertaken to maintain the current newspaper business of Scripps and Journal as an active business for a period of two years following the completion of the newspaper mergers;\n\u2022\nare generally restricted, for a period of two years following the newspaper mergers, from (i) reacquiring our stock, (ii) issuing stock to any person other than as compensation for services, (iii) making changes in equity structure, (iv) liquidating, merging or consolidating certain of our subsidiaries, (v) transferring certain material assets except in the ordinary course of business, and (vi) entering into negotiations with respect to, or consenting to, certain acquisitions of our stock;\n\u2022\nare generally restricted from taking any other action (including an action that would be inconsistent with the representations relied upon by Scripps and Journal described above) that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-offs; and\n\u2022\nhave generally agreed to indemnify Scripps and Journal for taxes and related losses incurred as a result of the spin-offs (other than the spin-off of Journal Spinco, which was taxable to Journal) failing to qualify as tax-free transactions provided such taxes and related losses are attributable to any act, failure to act or omission by us or our subsidiaries, including our failure to comply with applicable representations, undertakings and restrictions placed on our actions under the tax matters agreements.\nThese prohibitions could discourage, delay or prevent equity financings, acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances, mergers and other transactions, possibly resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any indemnity obligations to Scripps or Journal could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and liquidity.\nOur credit facility subjects us to various restrictions that could limit operating flexibility.\nOur credit facility contains certain covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and restricts our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares, incur additional indebtedness, make dispositions and create liens. These restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur.\nWe may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to our former parent companies or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from our former parent companies.\nUnder the terms of the master transaction agreement, Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify us, and we will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal), for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by the applicable party of the covenants contained in the master transaction agreement that continue in effect after the April 1, 2015 closing. Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify us for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by us relating to the entities, assets and liabilities retained by Scripps or Journal, and we will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal) for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by us relating to our entities, assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, Scripps will indemnify us, and we will indemnify Scripps, for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by the other of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in the tax matters agreements. We will also indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any tax imposed with respect to the Scripps Spinco spin-off if such tax is attributable to any act, any failure to act or any omission by us or any of our subsidiaries. Scripps will indemnify us for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to pre-closing taxes or taxes imposed on us or our subsidiaries because Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco was part of the consolidated return of Scripps or Journal, and we will indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to post-closing taxes of ours or our subsidiaries.\nThe indemnification obligations described above could be significant, although we do not presently believe there are any indemnification obligations for which we will be liable or for which we will seek payment from Scripps. Our ability to satisfy any such indemnities depends upon our future financial performance. Similarly, the ability of Scripps to satisfy any such obligations to us depends on its future financial performance. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to satisfy any substantial obligations to Scripps or that Scripps (including Scripps as successor to Journal) will have the ability to satisfy any substantial indemnity obligations to us.\nDecreases in advertising spending, resulting from economic downturn, war, terrorism, advertiser consolidation or other factors, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 60% of our revenue in 2015 was generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising appearing in newspapers and shoppers. Advertisers generally reduce their advertising spending during economic downturns and some advertisers may go out of business or declare bankruptcy. The merger or consolidation of advertisers, such as in the banking and airline industries, also generally leads to a reduced amount of collective advertising spending. A recession or economic downturn, as well as a consolidation of advertisers in the future could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks or other wars involving the United States or any other local or national crisis could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, some of our printed publications generate, and in the future are expected to generate, a large percentage of their advertising revenue from a limited number of sources, including the automotive industry. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, adverse changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could significantly reduce advertising revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, advertising revenue and subscription revenue depend upon a variety of other factors specific to the communities that we serve. Changes in those factors could negatively affect those revenues. These factors include, among others, the size and demographic characteristics of the local population, the concentration of retail stores and local economic conditions in general. If the population demographics, prevailing retail environment or local economic conditions of a community to be served by us were to change adversely, revenue could decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and during a time of rapid competitive changes, we may lose market share and advertising revenue to competing publications, or other competitors, as well as through consolidation of competitors or changes in advertisers' buying strategies.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Our newspapers, shoppers and Internet sites compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers, television and radio stations, shoppers and Internet sites as well as with other media such as magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail and the evolving mobile and digital advertising space. Some of our potential competitors have greater financial, marketing and programming resources than we have or, even if smaller in size or in terms of financial resources, a greater ability to create digital niche products and communities and may respond faster or more aggressively to changing competitive dynamics. This competition has intensified as a result of digital media technologies.\nIn newspapers and shoppers, our revenue primarily consists of advertising revenue and subscription revenue. Competition for advertising expenditures and subscription revenue comes from local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, magazines, broadcast and cable television, radio, direct mail, Yellow Pages, digital Internet and mobile products and other media. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics and circulation levels, while competition for subscription revenue is based largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality and customer service. Our local and regional competitors in community publications are typically unique to each market, but we have many competitors for advertising revenue that are larger and have greater financial and distribution resources than us. Subscription revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for our print products are affected by competition from other publications and other forms of media available in our various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among young people. We may incur increasing costs competing for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe print newspaper business is in secular decline. Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are not successful in creating other revenue opportunities or in aligning costs with declining revenues.\nIn recent years, the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward digital advertising and away from other traditional media. In addition, our historical newspaper circulation has declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including consumer migration toward the Internet and other media for news and information. We face, and in the future expect to continue to face, increasing competition from other digital sources for both advertising and subscription revenues. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies. Distribution of news, entertainment and other information over the Internet, as well as through smartphones, tablets and other devices, continues to increase in popularity. These technological developments are increasing the number of media choices available to advertisers and audiences. As media audiences fragment, we expect advertisers to continue to allocate larger portions of their advertising budgets to digital media.\nIn response to the ongoing secular changes, we must continually monitor and align cost structure to declining revenues. The alignment of our costs includes measures such as reduction in force initiatives, standardization and centralization of systems and processes, outsourcing of certain financial processes and the implementation of new software for circulation, advertising and editorial systems.\nIf we are not successful in creating other revenue opportunities, developing digital media or aligning costs with declining revenues, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe expect a significant portion of operating cost to come from newsprint, so an increase in price or reduction in supplies may adversely affect our operating results.\nNewsprint is a significant portion of our operating costs. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and increases in the price of newsprint could materially reduce our operating results. In addition, the continued reduction in the capacity of newsprint producers increases the risk that supplies of newsprint could be limited in the future. Our publishing business may suffer if there is a significant increase in the cost of newsprint or a reduction in the availability of newsprint.\nChanges relating to consumer information collection and use could adversely affect our ability to collect and use data, which could harm our business.\nPublic concern over methods of information gathering has led to the enactment of legislation in most jurisdictions that restricts the collection and use of consumer information. Our publishing business relies in part on telemarketing sales, which are affected\nby \u201cdo not call\u201d legislation at both the federal and state levels. We also engage in e-mail marketing and the collection and use of consumer information in connection with our publishing businesses and our growing digital efforts. Further legislation, government regulations, industry regulations, the issuance of judicial interpretations or a change in customs relating to the collection, management, aggregation and use of consumer information could materially increase the cost of collecting that data, or limit our ability to provide information to our customers or otherwise utilize telemarketing or e-mail marketing or distribute our digital products across multiple platforms, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDecreases in circulation may adversely affect subscription revenues, and circulation decreases may accelerate as we offer expanded digital content and digital subscriptions.\nAdvertising and subscription revenues are affected by the number of subscribers and single copy purchasers, readership levels and overall audience reach. The newspaper industry as a whole is experiencing difficulty maintaining paid print circulation and related revenues. This is due to, among other factors, increased competition from new media products and sources other than traditional newspapers (often free to consumers), and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. In addition, our planned expanded digital content and new digital subscriptions could negatively impact print circulation volumes if readers cancel subscriptions.\nA prolonged decrease in circulation could have a material effect on our revenues, particularly if we are not able to otherwise grow readership levels and overall audience reach. To maintain our circulation base, we may incur additional costs, and we may not be able to recover these costs through subscription and advertising revenues.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could increase our operating costs or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies. These laws and regulations, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of these laws and regulations, may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events. Such regulatory environment changes may include changes in employment laws, environmental laws, occupational health and safety laws, accounting standards and taxation requirements. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business, and therefore, may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry standards and trends, our publishing operations may not be able to effectively compete.\nThe publishing industry is being challenged by the preferences of today\u2019s \u201con demand\u201d culture, particularly among younger segments of the population. Some consumers prefer to receive all or a portion of their news in new media formats and from sources other than traditional newspapers. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as the Internet, various mobile devices, electronic readers, cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized newspaper readership. New digital subscription offerings may not attract readers in sufficient numbers to generate significant revenues or offset losses in paid print subscription revenues. The shift in consumer behaviors has the potential to introduce new market competitors or change the means by which traditional newspaper advertisers can most efficiently and effectively reach their target audiences. We may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new products or services that could compete with these evolving technologies.\nWe face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our operations, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware or other \u201ccyber attacks\u201d could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, jeopardizing our confidential information and that of our vendors and clients, and damaging our reputation. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information. Although we monitor our security measures regularly and believe we are not in a key target industry, any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, theft of data, network disruption, denial of service, or similar act by any party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, and security of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors. These events could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to protect information, and adversely affect our revenue by causing the loss of current or potential clients.\nRisk Factors Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nas a result of the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfor reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and provisions of Wisconsin law, could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our board or management. The provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action except at an annual or special meeting, thus not allowing our shareholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nregulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders by requiring advance notice of such proposals or nominations;\n\u2022\nregulate how special meetings of shareholders may be called; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. Under this authority, our board of directors could adopt a rights plan which could ensure continuity of management by rendering it more difficult for a potential acquirer to obtain control of us.\nOur indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the newspaper mergers could prevent a change in control.\nAn acquisition of our stock or further issuance of our stock could cause Scripps or the shareholders of Scripps or Journal to recognize a taxable gain or income on the spin-off of Scripps Spinco. Under the tax matters agreement we are required to indemnify Scripps or the shareholders of Scripps or Journal, as the case may be, for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares is limited by our financial results and our credit facility.\nOur credit facility limits our ability to declare and pay dividends or make other distributions on our shares of common stock and limits dividends and share repurchases from borrowed funds to no more than $10 million in any fiscal year. The dividend amounts and share repurchases, if any, will be determined by our board of directors, which will consider a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, funds generated from operations, future business prospects and applicable contractual restrictions.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequate to meet our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe are responsible for ensuring that all aspects of our business comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Although our management has experience with these reporting and related obligations, ensuring compliance with respect to our business may place significant demands on management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur\nadditional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including the exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger with Gannett\nOn October 7, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Gannett and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into us and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Gannett. If the merger is completed, our shareholders will receive $12.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock owned.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The following risk factors relate to risks posed to our shareholders from the proposed merger.\nThe merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to closing conditions that make the completion and timing of the merger uncertain. The conditions include, among others, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d); the absence of any law or governmental order enacted or issued prohibiting the merger; since October 7, 2015, there not having occurred any event, occurrence or development that is continuing and that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company material adverse effect; and the non-modification or withdrawal of the tax opinion delivered by Foley & Lardner LLP to Scripps on October 7, 2015 (relating to the continued tax-free nature of the April 1, 2015 transactions between Scripps and Journal Communications, Inc.) and no change in law or facts having occurred since October 7, 2015 that would make such tax opinion no longer reasonably acceptable to Gannett as of the closing date of the merger.\nAlthough we and Gannett have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use our respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals and consents, there can be no assurance that these approvals and consents will be obtained, and these approvals and consents may be obtained later than anticipated. If permitted under applicable law, either of we or Gannett may waive a condition for its own benefit and consummate the merger even though one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied. Any determination whether to waive any condition will be made by us or Gannett at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay to Gannett a termination fee.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from (i) encouraging, soliciting, requesting, initiating or negotiating, or furnishing nonpublic information with regard to, any proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal from any person and (ii) withdrawing or modifying our board of directors\u2019 recommendation in favor of the merger or approving or recommending any competing acquisition proposal. We may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including a determination by our board of directors (after having received the advice of a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to our shareholders than the merger. A termination in this instance would result in us being required to pay Gannett a termination fee of $9.0 million. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring us from considering or proposing a competing acquisition proposal with us, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the value of the merger consideration.\nFailure to complete the merger may negatively impact our share price and our future business and financial results.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that either us or Gannett may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not consummated on or before April 7, 2016, subject to an automatic extension for up to 60 days in order to satisfy the regulatory closing conditions. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Gannett including, among others, by us, in the event our board of directors determines to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specific circumstances, we will be required to pay Gannett a termination fee of $9.0 million.\nIf the merger is not completed on a timely basis, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. If the merger is not completed at all, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nbeing required to pay costs and expenses relating to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and, if applicable, termination fees, whether or not the merger is completed; and\n\u2022\nloss of time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the merger that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities.\nIf the merger is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed, or to the extent there is a market perception that the merger was not consummated due to an adverse change in our business.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with the merger.\nWe expect to pay significant transaction costs in connection with the merger. These costs include investment banking, legal fees and expenses, SEC and HSR Act filing fees, printing expenses, mailing expenses and other related charges. We estimate our aggregate transaction costs will be approximately $8 million to $10 million. A portion of the transaction costs will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is consummated.\nWhile the merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions under the Merger Agreement that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nPrior to the merger, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our business relationships may also have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties could impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel prior to completion of the merger and could cause third parties who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us, without Gannett\u2019s consent and subject to certain exceptions, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger closes or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement, and from making other changes to our business.\nPending litigation against us and Gannett could result in an injunction preventing completion of the merger, the rescission of the merger in the event it is completed and/or the payment of damages in the event the merger is completed.\nIn connection with the merger, purported shareholders of ours filed two class action lawsuits (which have been consolidated into a single lawsuit) against us, the members of our board of directors, Gannett and the other parties to the Merger Agreement. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger. As discussed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2016, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs regarding the settlement of all claims that were or could have been brought in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the consolidated lawsuit is currently stayed pending finalization of proposed settlement\ndocumentation, confirmatory discovery and a decision by the relevant court regarding approval of the proposed settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties to the memorandum of understanding will ultimately enter into a settlement agreement or that the court will approve the settlement even if the parties were to enter into a settlement agreement.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law or judgment, injunction, ruling, order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect that makes the merger illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the merger. If for any reason the consolidated lawsuit is not settled, the litigation may recommence and the plaintiffs may be successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us or Gannett from consummating the merger on the agreed-upon terms. In that event, the injunction may prevent the merger from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. Furthermore, if the proposed settlement is not approved and the defendants are not able to resolve the consolidated lawsuit, the consolidated lawsuit could result in substantial costs to us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors.", "PERMNO": 15228, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "JMG"}
