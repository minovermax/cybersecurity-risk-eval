No other customer\naccounted for more than 10%\nof our total\nsales for this\nperiod.\nThe loss of\nany significant portion\nof sales to\nany of our\nsignificant customers could\nhave a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nAccounts receivable\nbalances with\nfive customers\naccounted for\n64% of\naccounts receivable\nat December\n31, 2020.\nThe\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations of its\ncustomers\u2019\nfinancial condition and maintains reserves for potential bad debt\nlosses.\nIf the financial conditions of\nany of these customers were\nto deteriorate, impacting their\nability to pay their receivables,\nour reserves may not be\nadequate which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations,\nor financial\ncondition.\nWe are\ncontinuing to engage\nin efforts intended\nto strengthen and\nexpand our relations\nwith significant customers,\nas well as\nprovide support for\nour entire customer base.\nWe have supported our\nposition with customers through\ndirect and active\ncontact\nthrough our\nsales, quality,\nengineering, and\noperational personnel.\nWe cannot\nmake any\nassurances that\nwe will\nmaintain or\nimprove our customer\nrelationships, whether\nthese customers\nwill continue to\ndo business with\nus as they\nhave in the\npast or\nwhether we will be able to supply these customers or any of our\nother customers at current levels.\nOur business is affected by the cyclical and overall nature of the industries and markets that we serve.\nThe North American heavy and\nmedium-duty truck industries\nare highly cyclical.\nIn 2020, approximately 43%\nof our product\nsales were in these industries.\nThese industries and markets\nfluctuate in response to\nfactors that are beyond\nour control, such as\ngeneral economic conditions, interest\nrates, federal and state regulations\n(including engine emissions regulations,\ntariffs, import\nregulations, and\nother taxes),\nconsumer spending,\nfuel costs,\nand our\ncustomers' inventory\nlevels and\nproduction rates.\nOur\nmanufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component.\nAccordingly, during periods of changing demands, including\nan increase or\nslowdown in truck\ndemand, the profitability\nof our operations\nmay change proportionately\nmore than revenues\nfrom operations.\nIn addition, our operations are typically seasonal as a result\nof regular customer maintenance shutdowns, which\ntypically vary from\nyear to year\nbased on production\ndemands and occur\nin the third\nand fourth quarter\nof each calendar\nyear.\nThis seasonality may\nresult in decreased\nnet sales and\nprofitability during the\nthird and fourth\nfiscal quarters of\neach calendar\nyear. Weakness in overall economic conditions or in the\nmarkets that we serve, or significant reductions by our customers\nin their\ninventory levels or future production rates, could result in\ndecreased demand for our products and could\nhave a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPrice increases in\nraw materials and\navailability of raw\nmaterials could\nadversely affect\nour operating results\nand financial\ncondition.\nWe purchase resins\nand fiberglass for\nuse in production\nas well as\nhardware and other\ncomponents for product\nassembly. The\nprices for purchased materials\nare affected by the\nprices of material\nfeed stocks such as\ncrude oil, natural\ngas, and downstream\ncomponents, as well\nas processing capacity\nversus demand.\nWe attempt to\nreduce our exposure\nto increases by\nworking with\nsuppliers, evaluating\nnew suppliers,\nimproving material\nefficiencies, and\nwhen necessary\nthrough sales\nprice adjustments\nto\ncustomers.\nIf we are unsuccessful\nin developing ways\nto mitigate these\nraw material increases\nwe may not be\nable to improve\nproductivity or realize savings from cost reduction programs sufficiently to help offset\nthe impact of these increased raw material\ncosts. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nCost reduction and quality improvement\ninitiatives by original equipment manufacturers\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are\nprimarily a\ncomponents supplier\nto the\nheavy and\nmedium-duty truck\nindustries, which\nare characterized\nby a\nsmall\nnumber of original equipment\nmanufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d)\nthat are able to\nexert considerable pressure on\ncomponents suppliers to\nreduce costs, improve\nquality, and provide\nadditional design and\nengineering capabilities.\nGiven the fragmented\nnature of the\nindustry, OEMs\ncontinue to\ndemand and\nreceive price\nreductions and\nmeasurable increases\nin quality\nthrough their\nuse of\ncompetitive selection\nprocesses, rating\nprograms, and\nvarious other\narrangements. We\nmay be\nunable to\ngenerate sufficient\nproduction cost savings in the\nfuture to offset such\nprice reductions. OEMs may also\nseek to save costs by\npurchasing components\nfrom suppliers that\nare geographically closer\nto their production\nfacilities or relocating\nproduction to locations\nwith lower cost\nstructures and purchasing components from suppliers with lower production costs. These decisions by OEMs could require us to\nshift production between our facilities,\nmove production lines between our\nfacilities, or open new\nfacilities to remain competitive.\nShifting production,\nmoving production\nlines, or\nopening new\nlocations could\nresult in\nsignificant costs\nrequired for\ncapital\ninvestment, transfer expenses, and operating\ncosts. Additionally, OEMs\nhave generally required component suppliers\nto provide\nmore design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been\nabsorbed by the suppliers.\nTo the extent that\nthe Company does not\nmeet the quality standards\nor demands of quality\nimprovement\ninitiatives sought by OEMs,\nor does not match\nthe quality of suppliers\nof comparable products, OEMs\nmay choose to purchase\nfrom these\nalternative suppliers,\nand as\na result\nthe Company\nmay lose\nexisting or\nnew business\nwith OEMs.\nFuture price\nreductions, increased quality\nstandards, and additional\nengineering capabilities required\nby OEMs\nmay reduce our\nprofitability\nand have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and if\nwe are unable to effectively compete it may negatively impact future operating\nresults, sales, and earnings.\nThe markets in\nwhich we operate\nare highly competitive.\nWe compete with\na number of\nother manufacturers that\nproduce and\nsell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of capability, product quality, cost, and delivery.\nSome of our\ncompetitors have\ngreater financial\nresources, research\nand development\nfacilities, design\nengineering, manufacturing,\nand\nmarketing capabilities. If we are unable to develop\nnew and innovative products, diversify the markets,\nmaterials, and processes\nwe utilize\nand increase\noperational enhancements,\nwe may\nfall behind\ncompetitors or\nlose the ability\nto achieve\ncompetitive\nadvantages.\nIn the\nhighly competitive\nmarket in which\nwe operate,\nthis may negatively\nimpact our\nability to\nretain existing\ncustomers or attract new customers, and if that occurs, it may\nnegatively impact future operating results, sales, and earnings.\nWe may be subject to additional shipping\nexpense or late fees if we are not able to\nmeet our customers' on-time demand for our\nproducts.\nWe must continue to meet our customers' demand\nfor on-time delivery of our products.\nFactors that could result in our inability\nto meet customer demands\ninclude a failure by\none or more of\nour suppliers to\nsupply us with the\nraw materials and other\nresources\nthat we need to operate our\nbusiness effectively and an unforeseen spike\nin demand for our products, which\nwould create capacity\nconstraints, among\nother factors.\nIf this occurs,\nwe may be\nrequired to\nincur additional\nshipping expenses\nto ensure\non-time\ndelivery or otherwise be\nrequired to pay\nlate fees, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations,\nor financial condition.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel our business could be harmed.\nOur success\nlargely depends\non the\nefforts and\nabilities of\nour key\npersonnel. Their\nskills, experience,\nand industry\ncontacts\nsignificantly benefit\nus. The inability\nto retain\nkey personnel\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on our\nbusiness, results\nof\noperations, or\nfinancial condition.\nOur future success\nwill also depend\nin part upon\nour continuing ability\nto attract and\nretain\nhighly qualified personnel.\nWork stoppages\nor other labor issues at our facilities or at our customers' facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December\n31, 2020,\nunions at our\nColumbus, Ohio,\nMatamoros and\nEscobedo, Mexico,\nand Cobourg\nCanada facilities\nrepresented approximately 81% of our entire\nworkforce.\nAs a result, we are\nsubject to the risk of\nwork stoppages\nand other labor-\nrelations matters. The current\nColumbus, Ohio, Matamoros,\nMexico, Cobourg, Canada\n,\nand Escobedo, Mexico\nunion contracts\nextend through August\n7, 2022, January\n21, 2022,\nNovember\n1, 2021 and\nFebruary\n1, 2021,\nrespectively. Any prolonged work\nstoppage\nor strike at\neither our\nColumbus, Ohio; Matamoros\nand Escobedo,\nMexico; or\nCobourg, Canada\nunionized facilities\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non our business,\nresults of operations,\nor financial condition.\nAny failure by\nus to reach\na\nnew agreement upon expiration of such union contracts may have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nor financial\ncondition.\nThe Company\nis currently\nnegotiating an\nextension to\nthen Escobedo,\nMexico collective\nbargaining\nagreement.\nIn addition, if any\nof our customers or suppliers\nexperience a material work stoppage,\nthat customer may halt or\nlimit the purchase\nof our products or that supplier may interrupt supply of\nour necessary production components. This could cause us to shut\ndown\nproduction facilities relating to these products, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations,\nor financial condition.\nOur foreign operations in Mexico and Canada subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico and\nCobourg, Canada. As a\nresult, a significant portion\nof our business and operations is subject to\nthe risk of changes in economic\nconditions, tax systems, consumer preferences, social\nconditions, safety and security conditions, and political conditions inherent in Mexico and Canada, including changes\nin the laws\nand policies that govern foreign investment, as well as\nchanges in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign\ntrade and\ninvestment. Changes in laws and regulations related to foreign trade and investment may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing equipment and infrastructure.\nWe convert raw materials into molded products\nthrough a manufacturing process at each\nproduction facility. While we maintain\ninsurance covering our manufacturing and\nproduction facilities, including business interruption\ninsurance, a catastrophic loss of\nthe use of all\nor a portion of\nour facilities due to\naccident, fire, explosion, or\nnatural disaster, whether short\nor long-term, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment and machinery\nmay result in production delays, revenue loss, and\nsignificant repair costs,\nas well as injuries to our employees.\nAny interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures\nto remedy\nthe situation,\nwhich could\nhave a\nnegative impact\non our\nprofitability and\ncash flows.\nOur business\ninterruption\ninsurance may not be\nsufficient to offset the\nlost revenues or\nincreased costs that we\nmay experience during a\ndisruption of our\noperations.\nBecause we supply our products to OEMs, a temporary or long-term business disruption could result in a permanent\nloss of\ncustomers.\nIf this\nwere to\noccur, our\nfuture sales\nlevels and\ntherefore our\nprofitability could\nbe materially\nadversely\naffected.\nOur business is subject\nto risks associated with\nnew business awards.\nIn order to recognize profit from new\nbusiness, we must\naccurately estimate product costs as part of\nthe quoting process and implement effective\nand efficient manufacturing processes.\nExpected future sales\nfrom business awards\nmay not\nmaterialize.\nWe may\nnot realize the\nsales or\noperating results that\nwe\nanticipate from new\nbusiness awards, and\nwe may experience\ndifficulties in meeting\nthe production demands\nof new business\nawards.\nThe success of our business relies on our\nability to produce products which meet the quality, performance, and price expectations\nof our customers.\nOur ability to\nrecognize profit is largely\ndependent upon accurately\nidentifying the costs\nassociated with the\nmanufacturing of our products\nand executing the manufacturing\nprocess in a cost-effective\nmanner.\nThere can be\nno assurance\nthat all costs\nwill be\naccurately identified\nduring the\nCompany's quoting\nprocess or\nthat the\nexpected level\nof manufacturing\nefficiency will be achieved. As a result, we may not realize the anticipated operating results\nrelated to new business awards.\nWe will continue to pursue, and\nmay be awarded, new business\nfrom existing or new customers.\nThe Company may make capital\ninvestments, which may be\nmaterial to the Company,\nin order to meet the\nexpected production requirements\nof existing or new\ncustomers related to\nthese business awards,\nand to support\nthe potential production\ndemands which may\nresult from continued\nsales growth.\nThe anticipated impact on the Company's\nsales and operating results related\nto these business awards, for\nvarious\nreasons, may not materialize.\nAny delays or production\ndifficulties encountered in connection\nwith these business awards,\nand\nany change in\ncustomer demand, could\nadversely impact our\nbusiness, results of\noperations, and liquidity,\nand the benefits\nwe\nanticipate may never materialize.\nWe have made acquisitions and may make acquisitions in the future.\nWe may not realize the operating results that we anticipate\nfrom these acquisitions\nor from acquisitions\nwe may make\nin the future,\nand we may\nexperience difficulties in\nintegrating the\nacquired businesses or may inherit significant liabilities related to such businesses.\nWe explore opportunities to\nacquire businesses that we\nbelieve are related to\nour core competencies from time\nto time, some of\nwhich may be\nmaterial to us.\nWe expect such\nacquisitions will\nproduce operating\nresults consistent with\nour other operations;\nhowever, we cannot provide assurance that this assumption will prove\ncorrect with respect to any acquisition.\nAny acquisitions, may\npresent significant\nchallenges for\nour management\ndue to the\nincreased time\nand resources\nrequired to\nproperly integrate management, employees, information systems, accounting controls, personnel, and\nadministrative functions of\nthe acquired\nbusiness with\nthose of\nours and\nto manage\nthe combined\ncompany on\na going\nforward basis.\nThe diversion\nof\nmanagement's attention and\nany delays or\ndifficulties encountered in\nconnection with the\nintegration of these\nbusinesses could\nadversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity, and\nthe benefits we anticipate may never materialize.\nIf we are unable to meet future capital requirements,\nour business may be adversely affected.\nAs we grow our\nbusiness, we may have\nto incur significant capital\nexpenditures.\nWe may make capital\ninvestments to, among\nother things, build new or upgrade\nour facilities, purchase equipment, and\nenhance our production processes.\nWe cannot assure\nyou that we will have, or be\nable to obtain, adequate funds to\nmake all necessary capital expenditures when\nrequired, or that the\namount of future capital expenditures will not be materially\nin excess of our anticipated or current expenditures.\nIf we are unable\nto make necessary\ncapital expenditures we\nmay not have\nthe capability to\nsupport our customer\ndemands, which in\nturn could\nreduce our sales and profitability and impair our ability to satisfy our customers' expectations.\nIn addition, even if we are able to\ninvest sufficient resources, these\ninvestments may not generate\nnet sales that exceed\nour expenses, generate any\nnet sales at all,\nor result in any commercially acceptable products.\nWe may not\nachieve expected efficiencies\nrelated to the proximity\nof our customers'\nproduction facilities to our\nmanufacturing\nfacilities, or with respect to existing or future production relocation\nplans.\nCertain facilities are located in close proximity to\nour customers in order to minimize both our\ncustomers' and our own costs.\nIf\nany of\nour customers\nwere to\nmove or\nif nearby\nfacilities are\nclosed, that\nmay impact\nour ability\nto remain\ncompetitive.\nAdditionally, our\ncompetitors could\nbuild a\nfacility that\nis closer\nto our\ncustomers' facilities\nwhich may\nprovide them\nwith a\ngeographic advantage.\nAny of\nthese events\nmight require\nus to\nmove closer\nto our\ncustomers, build\nnew facilities,\nor shift\nproduction between our current facilities to meet our customers' needs,\nresulting in additional cost and expense.\nOur products\nmay be\nrendered obsolete\nor less\nattractive if\nthere are\nchanges in\ntechnology, regulatory\nrequirements, or\ncompetitive processes.\nChanges in\ntechnology, regulatory\nrequirements, and\ncompetitive processes\nmay render\ncertain products\nobsolete or\nless\nattractive.\nFuture chemical regulations may restrict\nour ability to manufacture products,\ncause us to incur\nsubstantial expenditures\nto comply with\nthem, and\nsubject us\nto liability for\nadverse environmental\nor health effects\nlinked to\nthe manufacture\nof our\nproducts.\nFailure to comply\nwith future regulations\nmay subject\nus to penalties\nor other\nenforcement actions.\nOur ability\nto\nanticipate changes in these areas\nwill be a significant factor\nin our ability to remain competitive.\nIf we are unable to\nidentify or\ncompensate for any one of these changes it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nDifficulty in hiring, training, and retaining skilled labor could result in increased cost overruns, an inability\nto satisfy customer\ndemands, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on\nskilled labor\nin the manufacturing\nof our products.\nHigh demand\nfor skilled manufacturing\nlabor in the\nUnited\nStates has resulted in\ndifficulty hiring, training, and\nretaining labor in\na tightening labor market.\nDifficulties in securing\nskilled\nlabor can result\nin increased hiring\nand training costs,\nincreased overtime to\nmeet demand, increased\nwage rates to\nattract and\nretain operators, and higher scrap and rework costs due to inexperienced\nworkers which would adversely affect our business.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nFluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates could adversely affect our results\nof operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial\ncondition.\nBecause of our international operations,\nwe are exposed to risk associated\nwith value changes in foreign\ncurrencies, which may\nadversely affect our business. Historically,\nour reported net sales, earnings,\ncash flow, and financial condition\nhave been subjected\nto fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange\nrate exposure is with the Canadian dollar and\nthe Mexican peso\nagainst the U.S.\ndollar. While we actively manage\nthe exposure of our\nforeign currency risk as\npart of our overall\nfinancial risk\nmanagement policy,\nwe believe\nwe may experience\nlosses from\nforeign currency\nexchange rate\nfluctuations, and\nsuch losses\ncould adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, or\nfinancial condition.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nOur stock price\ncan fluctuate widely\nin response to\na variety of\nfactors. Factors include\nactual or anticipated\nvariations in our\nquarterly operating results, our\nrelatively small public float, changes\nin securities analysts' estimates\nof our future earnings,\nand\nthe loss of major\ncustomers, or significant business developments\nrelating to us or\nour competitors, and other factors,\nincluding\nthose described in\nthis \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection. Our common\nstock also has\na low average\ndaily trading volume,\nwhich limits a\nperson's ability to quickly\naccumulate or quickly divest themselves\nof large blocks of\nour stock.\nIn addition, a low\naverage trading\nvolume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively few number\nof shares are being traded.\nWe have incurred impairment charges in\nthe past and we\nmay be required to incur additional\nimpairment charges in the future\non a portion\nor all of\nthe carrying value\nof our goodwill\nor other intangible\nassets associated with\nour reporting units, which\nmay adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEach year, and\nmore frequently on\nan interim basis\nif appropriate, we\nare required by\nASC Topic 350,\n\u201cIntangibles--Goodwill\nand Other,\u201d\nto assess the carrying value of\nour indefinite lived intangible assets\nand goodwill to determine whether\nthe carrying\nvalue of those assets is impaired. Such assessment and determination involves significant judgments to estimate the fair\nvalue of\nour reporting units, including estimating future cash flows,\nnear term and long term revenue growth, and\ndetermining appropriate\ndiscount rates, among\nother assumptions. If\noperating earnings fall\nbelow forecasted operating\nearnings, we would\nperform an\ninterim or\nannual goodwill\nimpairment analysis.\nShould that\nanalysis conclude\nthat the\nreporting unit\n\u2019s fair\nvalue were\nto be\nbelow carrying value a goodwill impairment charge\nwould be necessary. Any such charges could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial results in the periods in which they are recorded.\nOur ability to maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting may be insufficient to\nallow us to accurately report our\nfinancial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to\nbecome materially misleading and adversely\naffect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe require effective internal control\nover financial reporting in order\nto provide reasonable assurance with\nrespect to our financial\nreports and to effectively prevent fraud.\nInternal control over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements because\nof its\ninherent limitations,\nincluding the\npossibility of\nhuman error,\nthe circumvention\nor overriding\nof controls,\nor fraud.\nTherefore, even\neffective internal\ncontrols can\nprovide only\nreasonable assurance\nwith respect\nto the\npreparation and\nfair\npresentation of\nfinancial statements.\nIf we\ncannot provide\nreasonable assurance\nwith respect\nto our\nfinancial statements\nand\neffectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially\nmisleading, which could adversely affect the trading\nprice of our common stock.\nIf we are not\nable to maintain\nthe adequacy of our\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, including\nany failure to\nimplement\nrequired new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition, and\noperating results could be harmed. Any material weakness could affect\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness\nof\nour financial statements.\nAs a result,\nour ability to\nobtain any additional\nfinancing, or additional\nfinancing on favorable\nterms,\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nThis, in turn, could materially and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition,\nand the market value of our stock and\nrequire us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control\nsystems and procedures.\nIn addition, perceptions of the Company\namong customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others\ncould also\nbe adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement\nand maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nOur failure to\ncomply with our debt\ncovenants could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition,\nor results\nof operations.\nThe Company\u2019s credit\nagreements contain certain\ncovenants.\nThe Company\u2019s ability\nto borrow money and\nrepay existing debt\non scheduled terms under its existing credit agreements\nrequires the Company to be compliant with its\ncovenants. If a default of\ncovenants were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or\nborrow sufficient funds, which could materially adversely affect\nour results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nLegal, Insurance, Tax and Cybersecurity Risks\nChanges in the legal,\nregulatory, and social responses to climate\nchange, including any possible\neffect on energy prices, could\nadversely affect our business and reduce our profitability.\nIt is possible that various proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate changes, such as cap-and-trade systems,\nincreased limits on\nemissions of greenhouse\ngases and fuel\nefficiency standards, or\nother measures, could\nin the future\nhave a\nmaterial impact on\nus, our customers,\nor the markets\nwe serve, thereby\nresulting in a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on our\nfinancial\ncondition or results of operation. For example, customers in the transportation (automotive and truck) industry could be required\nto incur\ngreater costs\nin order\nto comply\nwith such\ninitiatives, which\ncould have\nan adverse\nimpact on\ntheir profitability\nor\nviability. This could in\nturn lead to\nfurther changes in the\nstructure of the\ntransportation industry that\ncould reduce demand\nfor\nour products. We\nare also reliant\non energy to\nmanufacture our products,\nwith our operating\ncosts being\nsubject to\nincrease if\nenergy costs\nrise. During\nperiods of\nhigher energy\ncosts we\nmay not be\nable to\nrecover our\noperating cost\nincreases through\nproduction efficiencies\nand price\nincreases. While\nwe may\nhedge our\nexposure to\nhigher prices\nvia future\nenergy purchase\ncontracts, increases in energy prices\nfor any reason (including\nas a result of\nnew initiatives related to climate\nchange) will increase\nour operating costs and likely reduce our profitability.\nWe may be\nsubject to product\nliability claims, recalls\nor warranty claims,\nwhich could have\na material adverse\neffect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAs a components supplier to OEMs, we face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that\nour products\nmalfunction and result in personal injury\nor death. Product liability claims could result\nin significant losses as a result\nof expenses\nincurred in\ndefending claims\nor the\naward of\ndamages.\nIn addition,\nwe may\nbe required\nto participate\nin recalls\ninvolving\ncomponents sold by\nus if any\nprove to be\ndefective, or we\nmay voluntarily initiate\na recall or\nmake payments related\nto such\nclaims in order\nto maintain positive\ncustomer relationships.\nWhile we do\nmaintain product liability\ninsurance, it\nmay not be\nsufficient to cover all product liability claims, and as\na result, any product liability claim brought against us could have\na material\nadverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we warrant the quality of our products under limited warranties, and as such,\nwe are subject\nto risk of warranty\nclaims in the\nevent that our\nproducts do not\nconform to our\ncustomers\u2019\nspecifications.\nSuch\nwarranty claims may\nresult in costly\nproduct recalls, significant\nrepair costs, and\ndamage to our\nreputation, all of\nwhich would\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect against the potential hazards to our business.\nWe maintain property,\nbusiness interruption,\nstop loss for\nhealthcare and\nworkers' compensation,\ndirector and officer,\nproduct\nliability, cyber, and casualty insurance coverage, but such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims,\nincluding losses resulting from\nwar risks, terrorist acts,\nor product liability claims\nrelating to products we\nmanufacture.\nConsistent\nwith market\nconditions in\nthe insurance\nindustry, premiums\nand deductibles\nfor some\nof our\ninsurance policies\nhave been\nincreasing and may\ncontinue to increase\nin the future.\nIn some instances, some\ntypes of insurance\nmay become available\nonly\nfor reduced amounts of coverage, if at all.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our insurers would not challenge\ncoverage\nfor certain claims.\nIf we were to incur a significant\nliability for which we were not\nfully insured or that our insurers disputed,\nit\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nWe are subject to\nenvironmental, occupational health and\nsafety rules and\nregulations that may require us to\nmake substantial\nexpenditures or expose\nus to\nfinancial or\nother obligations\nincluding substantial\ndamages, penalties,\nfines, civil\nor criminal\nsanctions, and remediation costs that could adversely affect our results.\nOur operations, facilities,\nand personnel are\nsubject to extensive\nand evolving laws\nand regulations pertaining\nto air emissions,\nwastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of\nsolid and hazardous materials and wastes, health\nand safety, the investigation\nand remediation of contamination, and the protection of the environment and\nnatural resources.\nIt is difficult to predict the future\ninterpretations and developments of environmental and\nhealth and safety laws and\nregulations or their impact on\nour future results\nand cash\nflows.\nContinued compliance\ncould result\nin significant\nincreases in\ncapital expenditures\nand operating\ncosts.\nIn\naddition, we\nmay be\nexposed to\nobligations or\ninvolved from\ntime to\ntime in\nadministrative or\nlegal proceedings\nrelating to\nenvironmental, health\nand safety\nor other\nregulatory matters,\nand may\nincur financial\nand other\nobligations relating\nto such\nmatters.\nCertain senior management employees have entered into potentially costly severance arrangements with\nus if terminated by the\nemployee for good reason.\nWe have entered into executive employment agreements\nwith executive officers that provide for significant severance\npayments\nin the event such employee's employment\nwith us is terminated by the employee for good\nreason (as defined in the employment\nagreement). Good reason includes\none or more of\nthe following occurring within\none year of a\nchange in control: (i)\na material\nreduction in\nbase salary,\n(ii) a\nmaterial diminution\nin the\nexecutive's position\nand/or duties,\n(iii) a\nmaterial breach\nof the\nemployment agreement\nby the\nperson or\nother entity\nthen controlling\nthe Company,\nor (iv)\na disavowal\nof the\nemployment\nagreement by the person or\nother entity then controlling the\nCompany. A\nchange in control occurs when\n(a) one person (as defined\nin the employment\nagreement), or\nmore than one\nperson acting as\na group, acquires\nownership of stock\nof the Company\nthat,\ntogether with the\nstock held by\nsuch person or\ngroup, constitutes more\nthan 50% of\nthe total fair\nmarket value or\ntotal voting\npower of the stock\nof the Company, (b) a\nmajority of the members\nof the Company's Board of\nDirectors (the \"Board\") are replaced\nduring any twelve\n-month period by\ndirectors whose appointment\nor election is\nnot endorsed by\na majority of the\nBoard before\nthe date of\nappointment or election,\nor (c) the\nsale of all\nor substantially all of\nthe Company\u2019s\nassets. These agreements\nwould\nmake it costly\nfor the employment\nof certain of\nour senior management\nemployees to\nbe terminated and\nsuch costs may\nalso\ndiscourage potential acquisition proposals, which may negatively affect our\nstock price.\nOur provision for income\ntax, adverse tax audits, or changes\nin tax policy could have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes\nin the United States, Mexico, and\nCanada. Our provision for income taxes\nand cash flow related\nto taxes may be negatively impacted by: (1) changes in the mix\nof earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory\nrates,\n(2) changes\nin tax\nlaws and\naccounting principles,\n(3) changes\nin the\nvaluation of\nour deferred\ntax assets\nand liabilities,\n(4)\ndiscovery of new information\nduring the course of\ntax return preparation,\n(5) increases in nondeductible\nexpenses, or (6)\nbeing\nsubject to include foreign income in the United States as part\nof the GILTI tax provision.\nTax audits may also\nnegatively impact our\nbusiness, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe are subject\nto continued\nexamination of\nour income\ntax returns,\nand tax\nauthorities may\ndisagree with\nour tax positions\nand assess\nadditional tax.\nWe\nregularly evaluate\nthe likelihood\nof adverse\noutcomes resulting\nfrom these\nexaminations to\ndetermine the\nadequacy of\nour\nprovision for income taxes. There\ncan be no assurance that\nthe outcomes from examinations\nwill not have a negative\nimpact on\nour future financial condition and operating results.\nCybersecurity attacks may\nthreaten our confidential\ninformation, disrupt operations\nand result in\nharm to our\nreputation and\nadversely impact our business and financial performance.\nCybersecurity attacks\nacross industries,\nincluding ours,\nare increasing\nin sophistication\nand frequency\nand may\nrange from\nuncoordinated individual attempts to measures targeted\nspecifically at us. These attacks include but are not limited\nto, malicious\nsoftware or\nviruses, attempts\nto gain\nunauthorized access\nto, or\notherwise disrupt,\nour information\nsystems, attempts\nto gain\nunauthorized access to business,\nproprietary or other confidential\ninformation, and other\nelectronic security breaches that\ncould\nlead to disruptions in critical systems,\nunauthorized release of confidential or\notherwise protected information and corruption\nof\ndata. Cybersecurity failures\nmay be caused by\nemployee error, malfeasance,\nsystem errors or\nvulnerabilities, including\nvulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers,\nand their products. We have been subject\nto cybersecurity attacks in the past.\nBased on\ninformation known to\ndate, past attacks\nhave not had\na material impact\non our financial\ncondition or results\nof operations. We\nmay experience such attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency\nor sophistication.\nFailures of our IT systems as a\nresult of cybersecurity attacks or other\ndisruptions could result in a breach\nof critical operational\nor financial controls and lead\nto a disruption of our\noperations, commercial activities or financial processes.\nCybersecurity attacks\nor other\ndisruptions impacting\nsignificant customers\nand/or suppliers\ncould also\nlead to\na disruption\nof our\noperations or\ncommercial activities.\nDespite our\nattempts to\nimplement safeguards\non our\nsystems and\nmitigate potential\nrisks, there\nis no\nassurance that such actions will\nbe sufficient to prevent cyberattacks\nor security breaches that manipulate\nor improperly use our\nsystems or networks, compromise\nconfidential or otherwise\nprotected information, destroy or\ncorrupt data, or otherwise\ndisrupt\nour operations. The occurrence of such\nevents could have a material adverse effect on\nour business financial condition and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nThe recent coronavirus\n(COVID-19) outbreak has\nadversely impacted\nour business\nand could\nin the\nfuture have a\nmaterial\nadverse impact on our\nbusiness, results of operation, financial\ncondition and liquidity, the\nnature and extent of which\nis highly\nuncertain.\nThe global outbreak of the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly\nincreased economic, demand and\noperational uncertainty.\nWe have global operations, customers\nand suppliers, including in countries\nimpacted by COVID-19. Authorities\naround the world\nhave taken a variety of measures to slow the\nspread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls\nor closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose\nadditional restrictions.\nWe have also\ntaken actions to\nprotect our employees\nand to mitigate\nthe spread of\nCOVID-19, including embracing\nguidelines\nset by the\nWorld Health Organization\nand the Centers\nfor Disease Control\nand Prevention on\nsocial distancing, good\nhygiene,\nrestrictions on\nemployee travel\nand in\n-person meetings,\nand changes\nto employee\nwork arrangements\nincluding remote\nwork\narrangements where\nfeasible. The\nactions taken\naround the\nworld to\nslow the\nspread of\nCOVID-19 have\nalso impacted\nour\ncustomers and\nsuppliers, and\nfuture developments\ncould cause\nfurther disruptions\nto the\nCompany due\nto the\ninterconnected\nnature of our\nbusiness relationships.\nThe extent\nto which\nCOVID-19 will\nimpact our\nongoing business,\nresults of\noperations,\nfinancial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the\ncontrol of the spread of\nthe virus, spread of new strains of the virus, additional actions taken by governmental authorities, and the ability to vaccinate the\ngeneral population.\nEconomic conditions and disruptions in the financial\nmarkets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition,\nand results of operations.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition\nif our ability to\nborrow money\nwere to\nbe impaired.\nDisruptions in\nthe financial\nmarkets may\nalso have\na material\nadverse impact\non the\navailability and cost\nof credit in\nthe future. Our\nability to pay\nour debt or\nrefinance our obligations\nwill depend on\nour future\nperformance, which\ncould be\naffected by,\namong other\nthings, prevailing\neconomic conditions.\nDisruptions in\nthe financial\nmarkets may also have an\nadverse effect on the U.S.\nand world economies, which would\nhave a negative impact on\ndemand for\nour products. In addition,\ntightening of credit markets\nmay have an adverse\nimpact on our customers'\nability to finance the\nsale\nof new trucks or\nour suppliers' ability to\nprovide us with raw\nmaterials, either of which\ncould adversely affect our\nbusiness and\nresults of operations.", "PERMNO": 84387, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "CMT"}
