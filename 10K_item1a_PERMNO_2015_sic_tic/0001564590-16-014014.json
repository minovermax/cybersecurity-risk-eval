{"cik": "1087934", "company": "inContact, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of risks we believe to be significant with respect to our business, operations, financial condition and other matters pertaining to our business and an investment in our common stock. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere as well as the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly, may not reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including revenue, profitability and cash flow may significantly fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nFluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u00b7\nOur ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the mix of revenue between our segments because the gross margin is significantly higher for the Software segment than for the Network connectivity segment;\n\u00b7\nThe timing and success of new product introductions and enhancements or product initiation by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nChanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nThe amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations;\n\u00b7\nThe purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nOur recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenue was $222.0 million, $171.8 million and $130.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 29% and 32%, respectively. Revenue increases in the future may not represent the same or comparable rates of revenue growth.\nWe believe growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nCapture market share from providers of legacy on-premise contact center systems as contact center systems are refreshed;\n\u00b7\nAttract new customers, increase our existing customers\u2019 use of our solution and further develop our partner ecosystem;\n\u00b7\nIntroduce our solution to new markets outside of the United States and increase global awareness of our brand;\n\u00b7\nStrengthen and improve our solution through significant investments in research and development; and\n\u00b7\nSelectively pursue acquisitions.\nIf we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our revenue may be harmed. In addition, we plan to continue our investment in future growth, including expending substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u00b7\nSales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization and of third-party channel partners;\n\u00b7\nOur technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u00b7\nSolution development, including investments in our solution development team and the development of new applications and features for existing solutions;\n\u00b7\nInternational expansion; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral administration, including legal and accounting.\nMoreover, we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base. We anticipate that we will significantly expand our operations and headcount in the near term. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, system failures, difficulties in introducing new features or solutions or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could harm our business performance and results of operations.\nThe expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth will make it more difficult for us to generate earnings or offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing costs and expenses in the short term. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan effectively.\nThe stability and growth of our revenues depends on our ability to attract and retain on-going customers.\nThe revenue model for companies selling software services under the cloud model, such as inContact, is to attract customers, retain these customers through the renewal of their monthly subscription contracts and encourage the addition of additional agent seats and functionality to these existing customers.\nAs our industry matures, as our customers experience seasonal trends in their business, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete favorably with our services, our ability to add new customers and renew, maintain or upsell existing customers based on pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired.\nWe also have relationships with third-party channel partners to attract new customers. Current third-party channel partner relationships may terminate and reduce the number of new customers we can attract to our product offering and cause disruptions with existing customer relationships, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our current relationships with third-party channel partners may be terminated by either party in the future. The termination of a reseller partner relationship may cause existing customers who have relationships with that third-party channel partners to become more likely to discontinue their services, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions of our customers or of our third-party channel partners could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers or by the acquiring companies.\nWe have a lengthy product sales and implementation cycle, which has contributed and may continue to contribute to the variability of operating results.\nWe have experienced a lengthy initial sales and implementation cycle for our software solutions, averaging approximately five to eight months. The lengthy sales and implementation cycle is one of the factors that has caused, and may continue to cause, our revenues and operating results to vary significantly.\nAs our inContact cloud software solutions is relatively new in the marketplace, we must provide a significant amount of education to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products and services, which can cause potential customers to take many months to make these decisions and results in less predictability in completing our sales. The length of the sales cycle can also be affected by other factors over which we have little or no control, including, customer budgetary constraints, timing of customer budget cycles, and concerns by the customer about the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors.\nAs we target our sales efforts at larger customers, we face longer implementation cycles. These larger organizations typically require more configuration and integration services, which increases our upfront investment in the deployment efforts.\nAs a result, sales and implementation cycles for our customers vary substantially from customer to customer and could contribute to the variability of our results of operations.\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted by the pricing decisions of our competitors and our providers. We may not be able to mitigate this impact with our other services.\nOur costs of revenues in our Network connectivity segment from period to period are affected by the pricing for network connectivity service we can obtain from the wholesale providers of these services. We must price our services at levels that are competitive, so costs of revenues affect the rates we offer to customers and our resulting revenues. This industry has a history of downward pressure on network connectivity service rates as a result of competition among providers. To acquire and retain customers, we offer these services at prices that are competitive in conjunction with the other benefits we provide. Consequently, falling prices will likely result in lowering our rates to users, which will reduce revenues. On the other hand, higher prices charged by our providers will increase our costs of revenues and cut into operating results, unless we raise prices to our customers, which may be difficult for us to do if our competitors are not subject to the same upward pricing pressures or choose not to increase prices notwithstanding such pressure. From period to period pricing volatility could adversely affect our result of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success largely depends upon the continued services of our key executive officers. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our business. We currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel and we may incur significant costs to do so. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing cloud software and for senior sales executives. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages.\nVolatility or lack of performance in the trading price of our common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because job candidates and existing employees often emphasize the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment when considering whether to accept or continue employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards is low or declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases our costs. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our solutions will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force and engage additional third-party channel partners.\nWe may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our direct sales force if we are unable to hire and develop talented direct sales personnel, if our new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if we are unable to retain our existing direct sales personnel.\nWe also may not achieve significant revenue growth from our third-party channel partners if we are unable to attract and retain motivated channel partners, if any existing or future channel partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our solutions for their users, or if they represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support competing products and services.\nIn addition, identifying new third-party channel partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. As the complexity of our solution and our third-party relationships increases, the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities will become more complicated. Our inability to successfully manage these complex relationships or negotiate sufficient contractual terms could harm our business.\nWe are expanding the sales of our services to customers located outside of the United States so our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe currently have offices outside of the United States and have operations, sales personnel or independent consultants in several foreign countries. We have limited experience operating in foreign jurisdictions. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of the United States increases the risk that our services and any future international expansion efforts will not be successful, which could result in us not meeting our revenue goals. Operating in international markets also requires management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing, acquiring or integrating operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These may include:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nLonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u00b7\nPotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions in international markets, including ongoing uncertainty in the economic conditions of global financial markets;\n\u00b7\nLocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u00b7\nDependence on certain third parties to increase customer sales;\n\u00b7\nThe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations related to privacy and network connectivity;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with bribery and corruption commercial practices law that prohibit certain commercial conduct worldwide;\n\u00b7\nIncreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk for international network connectivity fraud;\n\u00b7\nPolitical instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u00b7\nReduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally.\nIncremental revenue from reseller partners and international sales may not exceed expenditures, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe continue to expend a significant amount of money to develop our infrastructure and international delivery systems to be able to serve new customers we expect will come from the reseller sales channel and new sales opportunities we hope to develop in the future. We expect to make additional expenditures for this purpose in 2016. Revenue from our reseller arrangements may not be sufficient to cover our investment in infrastructure and facilities or our continuing cost of operating the expanded service capacity, which would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are not able to integrate acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired new technology and operations in the past, including Uptivity in May 2014, AC2 Solutions Inc. in January 2016 and certain technology, customers and equipment from Attensity, Inc in February 2016. We will continue to look for opportunities to acquire technologies or operations that we believe will contribute to our growth and development. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any acquisitions we pursue would involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies we acquire;\n\u00b7\nDiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u00b7\nOur inability to maintain the customers, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\nOur inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nOur responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of their failure to maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to the acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u00b7\nDelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire; and\n\u00b7\nAdverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance as a business.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur in future periods which may affect the realizability of our intangibles assets recognized through acquisitions. The events and circumstances that we consider include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business and/or product strategies. These events and\ncircumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nOur results of operations have shown significant losses over the past several years, which could impact the resources we have to pursue our business and adversely affect an investment in inContact.\nOur net loss was $22.8 million, $10.6 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Continued losses will diminish the working capital we have available to pursue development of our business. Sales within the Software segment continue to improve, but we have not achieved positive annual operating results and whether inContact will ultimately achieve positive results and cash flow should be considered a substantial risk with respect to our business.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could harm our profitability.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2018 for federal purposes, and for state purposes, expiration is dependent on the rules of the various states to which the net operating losses were allocated. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss, these carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could harm our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused. It is possible that such an ownership change could materially reduce our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income, which could harm our profitability.\nDisruptions in the operation of our technology could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are dependent on our computer databases, billing systems and accounting computer programs, network and computer hardware that houses these systems to effectively operate our business and market our services. Our customers may become dissatisfied by any system failures that interrupt our ability to provide our service to them. Substantial or repeated system failures would significantly reduce the attractiveness of our services. Significant disruption in the operation of these systems would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to continue to enhance our solution is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we are not able to adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new solution offerings and enhancements to our existing cloud contact center software. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop products, applications or features internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, inability to hire sufficient research and development personnel or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities.\nOur enhanced services are dependent on leased network connectivity lines, and a significant disruption or change in these services could adversely affect our business.\nOur inContact cloud software solutions are provided to customers through a dedicated network of equipment we own connected through leased network connectivity lines with capacity dedicated to us that is based on Internet protocol. Communication initiated by the user is converted to data packs that are transmitted through the dedicated network and managed by our software that resides on our equipment attached to the network. We also move a portion of our voice long distance service over this dedicated network because it lowers our cost of providing the service from using traditional transmission methods.\nWe lease network connectivity lines and space at co-location facilities for our equipment from third-party suppliers, which represents the backbone of our dedicated network. If any of these suppliers is unable or unwilling to provide or expand their current levels of service to us, the services we offer to customers would be adversely affected. We may not be able to obtain substitute services from other providers at reasonable or comparable prices or in a timely fashion. Any resulting disruptions in the services we offer that are provided over our dedicated network would likely result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our operations. Furthermore, pricing increases by any of the suppliers we rely on for the dedicated network could adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass pricing increases through to our customers.\nIf there are interruptions or delays in our services through third-party error, our own error or the occurrence of unforeseeable events, delivery of our solutions could become impaired, which could harm our relationships with customers and subject us to liability.\nWe provide our services through computer hardware that we own and that is currently located in third-party web hosting co-location facilities maintained and operated in California, Texas, Utah, Germany, England, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Our hosting providers do not guarantee that our customers\u2019 access to our solutions will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our operations depend on our providers\u2019 ability to protect their and our systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or network connectivity failures, criminal acts and similar events. Our back-up computer hardware and systems have not been tested under actual disaster conditions and may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage occurring simultaneously at all facilities. In the event that our hosting facility arrangements were terminated, or there was a lapse of service or accidental or willful damage to such facilities, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as well as delays and/or additional expense in arranging new facilities and services. Any or all of these events could cause our customers to lose access to the services they are purchasing from us. In addition, the failure by our third-party hosting facilities to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in our service or impede our ability to scale our operations.\nDesign and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our customers\u2019 service to their customers. Any interruptions or delays in our services, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and our reputation. This in turn could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause us to issue credits or pay penalties or cause customers to fail to continue service, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.\nIf our solutions fail to perform properly or if they contain technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline and we could be subject to product liability claims.\nOur software products and services may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in product failures, slow response times, or otherwise cause our products to fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations. Because our customers use our products and services for important aspects of their business, any errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our products and services could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. If that occurs, we could lose future sales, or our existing customers could elect to not renew or to delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts and an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable. Customers also may make account adjustment claims against us, which could result in the expense and risk of litigation. Product performance problems could result in loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance and the diversion of development resources. If one or more of our products fails to perform or contains a technical defect, a customer may assert a claim against us for substantial damages, whether or not we are responsible for the product failure or defect.\nProduct liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant settlements or damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such product liability claims. Also, our insurer may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. Any product liability claims successfully brought against us would cause our business to suffer.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our solution, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could harm our business.\nOur solution incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to transition to other providers. In addition, integration of the software used in our solution with new third-party\nsoftware may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. To the extent that our solution depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our solution, delay new product or solution introductions, result in increased costs, or a failure of our solution and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties.\nThere can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future, will be available to us at a reasonable cost or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in implementation delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative solutions could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could harm our business.\nWe provide service level commitments to our customers, which could cause us to provide credits for future services if the stated service levels are not met for a given period and could significantly harm our revenue.\nOur customer agreements provide service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our service, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future services. Our revenue could be significantly impacted if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers. In light of our historical experience with meeting our service level commitments, we do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments. The failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers for the value of an entire month of their subscription fees, not just the value of the subscription fee for the period of the downtime. As a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue these credits to all qualifying customers. Any extended service outages could harm our reputation, revenue and operating results.\nWe rely on third party network service providers to originate and terminate substantially all of our public switched telephone network calls, so significant failures in these networks could be detrimental to our operations.\nWe leverage the infrastructure of third party network service providers to provide telephone numbers, PSTN call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our customers rather than deploying our own network throughout the United States. If any of these network service providers cease operations or otherwise terminate the services that we depend on, the delay in switching our technology to another network service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur business could be harmed if our customers are not satisfied with the professional services and technical support provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, not only with respect to our solution but also with the professional services and technical support that are performed to enable our customers to implement and use our solution to address their business needs.\nProfessional services and technical support may be performed by our own staff or, with respect to a select subset of our solution, by third parties. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and harm our operating results. If a customer is not satisfied with the deployment and ongoing services performed by us or a third party, then we could lose customers, miss opportunities to expand our business with these customers, incur additional costs, or lose, or suffer reduced margins on our service revenue, any of which could damage our ability to grow our business.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and our failure to successfully grow and manage these relationships could harm our business.\nWe leverage strategic relationships with third parties such as system integrators, technology and telephony providers. We also license technology from certain third parties. Certain of these license agreements permit either party to terminate all or a portion of the license without cause at any time. As we grow our business, we will continue to depend on both existing and new strategic relationships. Our inability to establish and foster these relationships could adversely affect the development of our business, our growth and our results of operations.\nIf the security of our customers\u2019 confidential information contained in our systems or stored by use of our software is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, our service or our software may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service and our solutions.\nOur systems and software store and transmit proprietary information and critical data belonging to our customers and their users. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose us to a risk of information loss, litigation and other possible liabilities. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers\u2019 data, our relationships with customers and our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting co-location facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIf outside unauthorized parties succeed in penetrating our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customer information, we could be subject to liability. Our liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card or banking information, identity theft or other similar fraud claims, as well as for other misuses of personal information, including for unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims could result in litigation and adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations. As we continue to gain higher profile customers, the risk that unfriendly parties will attempt and succeed in penetrating our network security also increases.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights. We rely on trade secret, copyright, patent, and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the reverse engineering of our solutions. We may not be able to obtain any further trademarks, and our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents or trademarks. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in other countries are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nOur development of enhanced services could subject us to claims of patent infringement, such as the Microlog lawsuit, that would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe offer enhanced telecommunications and related software services through our dedicated network. Certain enhanced services similar to some of the services we offer have been the subject of litigation regarding patents and intellectual property rights. In addition, many companies in intellectual property-dependent industries, including the call center management and telecommunications industry, have employed intellectual property litigation as a means to gain an advantage over their competitors. As a result, we may be required to defend against claims of intellectual property infringement that may be asserted by our competitors against us and, if the outcome of any such litigation is adverse to us, it may affect our ability to compete effectively. We may not be aware of claims that have arisen alleging enhanced services we offer infringe on intellectual property rights of others. Currently, we are defending against a lawsuit filed by Microlog alleging we have infringed its patent for a contact center system capable of handling multiple media types of contacts and methods for the using the system. This lawsuit began in January 2014, and at this time we cannot make any estimate or prediction regarding how this lawsuit may progress in the future. Our involvement in litigation, opposition proceedings, or other intellectual property proceedings may divert management time from focusing on business operations, could cause us to spend significant amounts of money, and may have no guarantee of success. Any current and future intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nStop selling, incorporating, manufacturing or using our service offerings that use the subject intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nObtain from a third party asserting its intellectual property rights, a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\nRedesign those services or processes that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign could be technically unfeasible; or\n\u00b7\nPay damages, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights.\nWe are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by, and issued to, third parties. We cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail if any of this third-party intellectual property is asserted against us or that we will ultimately prevail in the patent infringement litigation with Microlog.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nRegulation of IP telephony services is unclear, so the imposition of significant regulation in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nWe deliver our inContact cloud contact center solutions and move other network connectivity service through our VoIP Network. We view government regulation as one of the conditions of the environment within which we conduct business that does impact, and will continue to impact, our business as we endeavor to comply with existing regulations and what may come in the future. At both the federal and state level there are initiatives, proposals, proceedings and investigations pending with respect to telecommunications, IP telephony and the Internet that we describe in some detail above in the \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d section of Item 1. Business. This section describes areas where the regulatory landscape could change and significantly impact our business, and you should review that section carefully. Our failure to anticipate, plan for, and comply with new regulation as it comes along on a cost effective basis is a continuing risk of our business that could have a significant adverse effect on our business activity and results of operations.\nIncreased taxes or fees on our service will increase our customers\u2019 cost of using our service and/or reduce our profit margins (to the extent the costs are not passed through to our customers) and we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and additional taxes, surcharges and fees.\nThe tax and fee structure relative to network connectivity and enhanced communications services is complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation. Based on its interpretation of applicable law, the Company believes that it has either remitted or accrued for all taxes and regulatory fees owed as a result of its operations. If, however, taxing and regulatory authorities arrive at different interpretations of applicable law, our ultimate liability could exceed the amount the Company has remitted and accrued. In addition, the collection of additional taxes, fees or surcharges in the future could have the effect of increasing our prices or reduce our profit margins. Compliance with these regulations may also make us less competitive with those competitors who choose not to comply with the regulations.\nThe FCC adopted orders reforming the system of payments between regulated carriers that we partner with to interface with the public switched telephone network. The rates we pay for the services performed by these carriers may increase as a result of the FCC\u2019s reform order. As a result, we may increase rates for service, making our offerings less competitive with others in the marketplace, or reduce our profitability.\nThe FCC reformed the system under which providers of network connectivity services compensate each other for transporting and/or terminating various types of traffic, including VoIP traffic that terminates on the PSTN and applied new call signaling requirements to VoIP and other service providers. The FCC\u2019s rules concerning charges for transmission or termination of VoIP traffic could result in an increased cost to terminate the traffic absent specific agreements that include a rate for VoIP-PSTN traffic when exchanged between us and other carriers. For VoIP traffic that terminates on the PSTN, the Order establishes a transitional framework that establishes default intercarrier compensation rates for VoIP-PSTN traffic that are equal to the rates applicable to non-VoIP traffic and allows regulated providers of network connectivity services to tariff these default charges in the relevant federal and state tariffs that apply in the absence of an agreement. The rules also establish a multiyear transition to a national \u201cbill-and-keep\u201d framework as the ultimate end state for traffic exchanged with a local exchange carrier. Under bill-and-keep, providers do not charge one another for terminating traffic and instead recover the costs of termination from their own customers. To the extent that the company transmits VoIP traffic that is not subject to an existing intercarrier compensation arrangement and another provider imposes higher intercarrier compensation charges than we, or the third parties terminating our traffic to the PSTN, pay today, our termination costs could initially increase. In the near term, this change could result in us either increasing our retail charges for services to our customers or, reducing our profitability. However, over the longer term, we expect our costs to terminate traffic to the PSTN to decline.\nWe may become subject to state regulation for certain service offerings, which could increase our cost of doing business.\nCertain states take the position that offerings by VoIP companies are intrastate and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that the FCC has pre-empted states from regulating VoIP offerings in the same manner as providers of traditional network connectivity services. We cannot predict how this issue will be resolved or its impact on our business at this time.\nNew regulation of the Internet by governmental agencies could adversely affect the way we operate or increase our cost of doing business.\nIn addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet, in general, could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally. Congress is also considering a permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (\u201cITFA\u201d) which could impact the taxation of Internet access services generally, and thereby the Company\u2019s costs of doing business.\nFederal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to offer services outside the U.S. is subject to different local regulatory environments, which may be unknown, complicated and uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment of enhanced communications services outside the United States varies from country to country and often the laws are unclear. We currently distribute our products and services directly to consumers and through resellers and channel partners that may be subject to network connectivity regulations in their home countries. The failure by us or our customers, resellers and channel partners to comply with these laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability. Because of our relationship with the resellers and channel partners, some countries may assert that we are required to register as a network connectivity provider in that country. In such case, our failure to do so could subject us to fines or penalties. In addition, some countries are considering subjecting enhanced communication services to the regulations applied to traditional telephone companies. Regulatory developments such as these could have an adverse effect on the use of our services in international locations and as a result, our growth and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our long-term capital needs.\nWe may determine that additional capital will be necessary in responding to business challenges, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, fund expansion, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses, products and technologies, or for other reasons. To that end we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that allows us to offer and sell an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants from time to time, up to a maximum dollar amount of $125 million, which we can use should we decide to raise capital in the future. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, at the time when we need such funding to pursue our business objectives. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of the Company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, if we decide to raise funds through debt or convertible debt financings, we may be unable to meet our interest or principal payments.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our financial statements completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and will occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our reported financial results or the way we account for or conduct our business.\nCertain factors have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to defer recognition of revenues. For example, the inclusion in our customer contracts of material non-standard terms, such as acceptance criteria, could require the deferral of revenue. To the extent that such contracts become more prevalent in the future our revenue may be harmed. Because of these factors and other specific requirements under U.S. GAAP for revenue recognition, we must have precise terms and conditions in our arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we deliver our solution or perform our professional services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle, and we may accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery.", "PERMNO": 92320, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SAAS"}
