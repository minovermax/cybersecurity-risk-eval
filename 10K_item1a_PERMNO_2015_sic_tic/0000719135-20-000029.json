Risk factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business, important risk factors that may affect us are discussed below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact or impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe energy-based medical device industry in the aesthetics market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe energy-based medical device industry for the aesthetics market is highly competitive. Many competitors in this industry are well-established, do a substantially greater amount of business and have greater financial resources and facilities than we do.\nWe have invested and continue to invest, substantial resources to develop and monetize our J-Plasma\u00ae/Renuvion\u00ae technology. We believe we must continue to develop new applications for our products and obtain new indications for use in order to stay competitive. If we are unable to gain acceptance of our technology in the marketplace, or obtain new indications for use, our business and results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also compete by private labeling our products for major distributors under their label. This allows us to increase our position in the marketplace and thereby compete from two different approaches, our Apyx label and our customers\u2019 private label. Our private label customers distribute our products under their name through their internal sales force. We believe our main competitors do not private label their products.\nMaintaining strong relationships with plastic surgeons, cosmetic physicians, and other healthcare professionals, is critical to the success of our product commercialization strategy.\nPart of our strategy depends on developing strong working relationships with key plastic surgeons, cosmetic physicians and other healthcare professionals. The guidance we get from these relationships is important from both a commercialization strategy and product development standpoint. Without these relationships, the development and commercialization of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on our internal sales force and sales partners to market and sell our products. If we are unable to hire, effectively train, and retain these professionals, future sales and profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe implementation of our growth strategy largely depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain our sales professionals. We train our sales professionals to thoroughly understand our Helium Plasma Technology and the marketplace in which we compete, including how our technologies can increase our customer's revenue and the results they are able to achieve for their patients. It may take time for these sales professionals to become productive and there can be no assurance that recently recruited sales professionals will be adequately trained in a timely manner, that our direct sales productivity will improve, or that we will not experience significant levels of attrition in the future.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with competitive advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our research and development efforts rely upon investments and alliances and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or alliances will be successful.\nOur research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop new and innovative products for introduction in the marketplace. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products, such as our J-Plasma\u00ae/Renuvion\u00ae technology, and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and areas of development.\nThese activities are primarily conducted internally and are expensed as incurred. Expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials and services associated with the development of our products net of any reimbursements from customers. Research and development expenses do not include any portion of general and administrative expenses. Our research and development activities are conducted at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. We expect to continue making future investments to enable\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nus to develop and market new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing business. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments in both facilities will be successful or that our new products will gain market acceptance, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe amount expended by us on research and development of our products during the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, totaled approximately $3.7 million, $2.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. During the past three years, we invested substantial resources in the development and marketing of our Advanced Energy product technology. We have not incurred any direct costs relating to environmental regulations or requirements. For 2020, we expect to invest approximately 10% to 15% of revenue for research and development activities.\nEven if we are successful in developing new, or enhancing our existing products, there are various circumstances that could prevent their successful commercialization.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on a number of factors, any of which could delay or prevent commercialization, including:\n\u2022our inability to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for expanded indications, new products,\nor product modifications;\n\u2022we are unable to demonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials;\n\u2022our product is determined to be ineffective or unsafe following approval and is removed from the market or we\nare required to perform additional research and development to further prove the safety and effectiveness of the\nproduct before re-entry into the market;\n\u2022the regulatory approvals of our new products are delayed (or denied) or we are required to conduct further\nresearch and development of our products prior to receiving regulatory approval;\n\u2022we are unable to build and maintain a sales and marketing group to successfully launch and sell our new products;\n\u2022we are required to allocate available funds to litigation matters;\n\u2022the needs of our physicians or their patients are not sufficiently met;\n\u2022we are unable to manufacture the quantity of product needed (in accordance with quality manufacturing\nstandards) to meet market demand, or at all;\n\u2022competition from other products or technologies prevents or reduces market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022we do not have and cannot obtain the intellectual property rights needed to manufacture or market our products\nwithout infringing on another company\u2019s patents; or\n\u2022we are unsuccessful in defending against patent infringement or other intellectual property rights, claims that\ncould be brought against us, our products or technologies;\nThe failure to successfully commercialize products will have a material and adverse effect on the future growth of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nOur industry is highly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international regulatory authorities, as well as other governmental, state and federal agencies which have substantial authority to establish criteria which must be complied with in order for us to continue in operation.\nUnited States\nOur products and research and development activities are subject to regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities:\n\u2022Product development\n\u2022Product testing\n\u2022Product labeling\n\u2022Product storage\n\u2022Pre-market clearance or approval\n\u2022Advertising and promotion\n\u2022Product traceability\n\u2022Product indications\n\u2022Post Market performance (complaints, adverse events, field actions)\nIn the United States, medical devices are classified by the FDA on the basis of control deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device.\nCurrently, we only manufacture Class I and Class II devices. Our \"Class II\" devices require Pre-Market Notification, otherwise known as a \"510(k) clearance\". A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalence claims. Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the form of a letter, from FDA which finds the device to be substantially equivalent (SE) and states that the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order \"clears\" the device for commercial distribution.\nInternational Regulation\nTo market products in the European Union, our products must bear the \u201cCE\u201d mark. Manufacturers of medical devices bearing the CE mark have gone through a conformity assessment process that assures that products are manufactured in compliance with a recognized quality system in the areas of design, development and manufacturing requirements and that they comply with the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD).\nEach device that bears a CE mark has associated technical documentation that includes a description of the following:\n\u2022Description of the device and its components,\n\u2022A Summary of how the device complies with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive,\n\u2022Safety (risk assessment) and performance of the device,\n\u2022Clinical evaluations with respect to the device,\n\u2022Methods, facilities and quality controls used to manufacture the device and\n\u2022Proposed labeling for the device.\nManufacturing and distribution of a device is subject to ongoing surveillance by the appropriate regulatory body to ensure continued compliance with quality system and reporting requirements.\nThe European Union\u2019s (EU) Medical Device Regulation (MDR), officially passed in April 2017, represents the first major changes to the EU medical device regulatory environment in more than 20 years. The new EU MDR has significantly raised the compliance bar for the medical device industry and will cause significant changes to the regulatory obligations of legal manufacturers, importers and distributors involved in the medical device distribution chain. Enforcement of this new regulation will transition in over the next two years. The EU MDR is far more complex than the existing Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and it presents new challenges for manufacturers. Classification has changed for some product categories and strict new requirements have been imposed on clinical data, risk management, post market surveillance, and supplier management.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nOutside of the European Union, regulations vary significantly from country to country and are becoming increasingly stringent and country specific. Territories and countries around the world continue to develop their own unique regulatory requirements and these individual governments are passing laws that enforce these new regulations and also imposing fees to register products in their country. The time and effort required to obtain approval to market products may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States or the European Union. Certain European countries outside of the European Union and other countries in the world do not recognize the CE mark certification or FDA clearance and have their own regulatory requirements to register and sell products in these territories. We are required to meet regulatory requirements and obtain registrations for our products in all countries that have these regulatory requirements prior to selling our products in that country.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nThe medical device industry continues to be the subject of intense scrutiny and stringent regulation and the demand for green, sustainable products is rapidly increasing. There are increasing requirements for efficient and accurate processes for hazardous substance handling, supplier disclosures and regulatory reporting in order to comply with numerous global health and environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive\n\u2022Packaging and Packing Waste Directive\n\u2022REACH Regulation\n\u2022Proposition 65\n\u2022Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide\nCompliance with existing and future environmental regulations may have an impact on the manufacturing and sterilization of our medical devices. Environmental regulations in the US and EU limit or prohibit the use of certain chemicals, substances and materials in the manufacture of our medical devices such as Prop 65 in California and others in the EU such as REACH, RoHS, and WEEE Directive. With the current global concerns over climate change and the tangible effects human beings are having on the environment, there is no doubt that the amount of environmental legislation is primed to increase still further, with EU being at the forefront of this movement.\nEthylene oxide is used to sterilize approximately 50% of medical devices in the U.S. While some alternative methods currently exist, potential device incompatibility issues exist with these alternatives. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified EtO as a carcinogen after linking it to cases of breast cancer, lymphoma and leukemia. Over the course of 2019, public concerns about the emissions from sterilization facilities using EtO resulted recently in the permanent closure of two facilities (one in Illinois and the other in Michigan) as well as temporary closures for at least two facilities in Georgia and a new facility at risk in Illinois. In addition, the Illinois state legislature is considering a bill that would phase out hospital in-house use of EtO and require EtO commercial sterilization facilities operating within the state to relocate to \u201cscarcely populated areas.\u201d Currently, shortages due to current closures are not expected, but any additional commercial sterilization facility closures could result in shortages for certain devices. Our devices are not currently impacted by these closures however, it is unknown if the current EtO facilities utilized by Apyx Medical could be impacted in the future.\nThe FDA is closely monitoring the supply chain effects of closures and potential closures of certain facilities that use ethylene oxide to sterilize medical devices prior to their use. The Agency is concerned about the future availability of sterile medical devices and the potential for medical device shortages that might impact patient care. However, the FDA does not have oversight authority over ethylene oxide emissions, that responsibility is within the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAnti-Corruption Regulation\nAs we grow our international presence and global operations, we will be increasingly exposed to statutes, anti-corruption trade policies, economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments and organizations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, other foreign statutes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures are or will be sufficient to prevent violations from occurring. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nWe operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To date, we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and as a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses. We purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by satisfying foreign denominated expenditures with cash flows or assets denominated in the same currency therefore we are subject to some foreign currency fluctuation risk. Our currency value fluctuations were not material for 2019.\nThere are also other risks inherent with operating on a global scale, not limited to the following:\n\u2022Inability to obtain country-specific product registrations and clearances\n\u2022Compliance with local regulations\n\u2022Challenges with staffing our foreign operating facilities\n\u2022Insufficient commercialization efforts in new countries due to lower than expected distributor performance\n\u2022Theft or compromise of our intellectual property\n\u2022Political changes or economic instability\nChanges in U.S. trade policies could significantly increase the cost of imported goods into the United States, which may materially reduce our sales or profitability.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars,\" in increased costs for goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, may be materially reduced. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our sales volumes. Further, the realization of these matters may increase our cost of goods and, if those costs cannot be passed on to our customers, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil, gasoline and other commodities.\nWe use plastics and other petroleum-based materials along with precious metals contained in electronic components as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gasoline also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gasoline and precious metal prices are volatile and may increase, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset through other cost reductions, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe manufacture the majority of our products at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. Components, labor-intensive assemblies and sub-assemblies, and sterilization services are out-sourced to third party manufacturers/services and produced to our specifications.\nWe are also dependent on OEM customers who have no legal obligation to purchase products from us. Should such customers fail to give us purchase orders for the product after development, our future business could be negatively affected. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such customers will give sufficient high priority to our products. Finally, disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our customers, which could adversely affect production and sales of our products.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nThe recent Coronavirus outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and recently has spread to the United States and many other parts of the world and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow for an extended period of time.\nThe outbreak of the Coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions may continue to adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving.\nOngoing significant reductions in business related activities could result in further loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial results, liquidity and cash flows will depend largely on future developments, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and action taken to contain or prevent further spread within the U.S. and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIf the COVID-19 outbreak continues and persists for an extended period of time, we expect there will be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and delays in the manufacturing and shipment of our products, which may then have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThese and other potential impacts of COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on certain suppliers, subcontractors, and manufacturers for raw materials and other products and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials and subcontracting services we use in our manufacturing could have a negative effect on our cost of sales and our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Inability to meet the demands of our customers could result in the loss of future sales.\nIn addition, the costs to manufacture our products depend in part on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. We may not be able to pass along to our customers all or a portion of our higher costs of raw materials due to competitive and marketing pressures, which could decrease our earnings and profitability.\nWe also have collaborative arrangements with three key foreign suppliers under which we request the development of certain items and components and we purchase them pursuant to purchase orders. Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. The majority of our raw materials are purchased from sole-source suppliers. While we believe we could ultimately procure other sources for these components, should we experience any significant disruptions in this key supply chain, there are no assurances that we could do so in a timely manner which could render us unable to meet the demands of our customers, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. For example, we source certain materials used in the manufacture of our products from China; the coronavirus outbreak or other similar global disruptions could make access to our existing supply chain difficult and could impact our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nWe have been issued 37 patents in the United States and 26 foreign patents. We have 16 pending patent applications in the United States and 26 pending foreign applications. Our intellectual property portfolio for our J-Plasma\u00ae/Renuvion\u00ae products continues to grow on an annual basis. We intend to continue to seek legal protection, primarily through patents, for our proprietary technology. Seeking patent protection is a lengthy and costly process and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending applications, or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad or strong to protect our proprietary technology. There is also no guarantee that any patents we hold will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the patent rights granted will provide competitive advantages to us. Our competitors have developed and may continue to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nAdverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties on terms that may not be reasonable or favorable to us, prevent us from manufacturing, importing or selling our products, or compel us to redesign our products to avoid infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property. As a result, our product offerings may be delayed and we may be unable to meet customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner. Regardless of the merit of any related legal proceeding, we have incurred in the past and may be required to incur in the future substantial costs to prosecute, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Even in the absence of infringement by our products of third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or litigation related to trade secrets, we have elected in the past and may in the future elect to enter into settlements to avoid the costs and risks of protracted litigation and the diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. However, if the terms of settlements entered into with certain of our competitors are not observed or enforced, we may suffer further costs and risks. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to develop intellectual property depends in large part on hiring, retaining and motivating highly qualified design and engineering staff with the knowledge and technical competence to advance our technology and productivity goals. To protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, generally we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, as well as with consultants and other parties. If these agreements prove inadequate or are breached, our remedies may not be sufficient to cover our losses.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to litigation proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, and we are and may become subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including claims by current or former employees, distributors and competitors, and with respect to our products and product liability claims, lawsuits and proceedings.\nWe are involved in a number of legal actions relating to the use of our technology. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In the opinion of management, the Company has meritorious defenses, and such claims are adequately covered by insurance, or are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition. However, in the event that damages exceed the aggregate coverage limits of our policy or if our insurance carriers disclaim coverage, we believe it is possible that costs associated with these claims could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows (see below ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings).\nIntellectual Property Litigation or Trade Secrets\nWe have in the past, experienced certain allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights and use of trade secrets and may receive other such claims, with or without merit, in the future. Previously, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights have sometimes evolved into litigation against us and they may continue to do so in the future. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation. Although we believe we have had adequate defenses to these claims and that the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, there can be no assurances that we will prevail. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us, significantly reduce our cash resources and create a diversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we could be prohibited from future sales of the allegedly infringing product or products, which could materially and adversely affect our future growth.\nOur business is subject to the potential for recalls or safety alerts, litigation and negative publicity associated with defects or failures of our products, or their misuse\\off-label use by physicians.\nManufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, misuse uses by physicians, or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. In addition, there may be increased risk of injury if physicians or others attempt to use our products off-label. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's use of a medical device within the practice of medicine, and we cannot prevent a physician from using our products for an off-label use. The use of our products for indications other than for those for which our products have been approved or cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat the conditions not referenced in our product indications. These problems could lead to litigation, a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products, either of which could result in significant costs and negative publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nand demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of our current regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals. We also may undertake voluntarily to recall products or temporarily shut down certain production lines based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nNegative conditions in the national or global economy could adversely affect our business and financial condition. During times of an uncertain economy and tight credit markets our customers may be unwilling or unable to borrow money to properly finance their operations. This may include difficulty in obtaining credit lines to purchase our products, or to maintain their business at current levels. The cosmetic procedure market can be particularly vulnerable to negative trends in the local or global economy since the end-user may have less discretionary income or be unsure about spending their discretionary income. This could result in less demand for procedures where our products are used. Additionally, some end users may have difficulty in obtaining financing at an acceptable interest rate that would be necessary to purchase the procedures in which our products are being used.\nThese factors could result in reduced revenues from the sale of our product, slower adoption of new technologies, longer sales cycles, increased price competition and increased difficulties in the collection of accounts receivables as, in certainly countries, payments by our customers are dependent on the financial stability of the economy. With the current economic state in many countries outside the United States, we will continue to monitor the ability of our customers to pay their obligations to us as any weaknesses in their end-user market could affect their cashflow and results in delays in their payments to us. This would increase the risk in our credit exposure and delay our ability to recognize revenues of current and future sales to these customers. Any of these events could harm our business and have material adverse effects on our financial condition.\nThere may be circumstances that arise that may cause us to use some of our existing financial assets ineffectively.\nAs a result of the proceeds received from the sale of our Core business in 2018, we were able to pay off all significant debt obligations and invest in cash and cash equivalents to support our continued growth initiatives over the coming years. Future decisions made to invest in certain initiatives may not have the expected results, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations and impact overall stockholder value. In addition, due to fluctuations in interest rates, our investments may not always yield a favorable rate of return.\nWe may, in the future, identify deficiencies in controls over financial reporting.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, we have concluded that two of the three material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting identified during the year ended December 31, 2018 were not fully remediated due to the need for additional qualified accounting personnel and the lack of sufficient documentation or timeliness in completing certain business processes. In 2019 we also identified a material weakness at our subsidiary in Bulgaria related to the purchasing of goods and services and the processing and payment of vendor invoices. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWhile we are in the process of identifying and implementing remedial measures to address the control deficiencies that led to these material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that remediation will be fully completed in 2020 or that the remedial measures will prevent future control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, and to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC will likely be adversely affected.\nWe are at risk of being the victim of a cyber-attack or a security breach that may expose confidential customer, product and Company data or compromise our internal IT infrastructure. This could lead to liabilities resulting from failure to comply with US and foreign data security and privacy regulations and negative impacts to our business operations.\nWe store in our computer systems and network various elements of data and information related to our customers, products and company that could be compromised as the result of a cyber-attack or security breach. If an individual or group of individuals, including a Company employee, were to compromise confidential information, or if customer confidential information is\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\ninappropriately disclosed due to a security breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, we may face substantial liabilities or incur penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws or regulations. We also rely heavily on our internal systems, network and data. Any attacks on our IT infrastructure could have a significant impact on our daily manufacturing and customer service functions which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur business is dependent on the security of our IT networks and those of our customers. Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our engagements and impede our ability to provide critical services to our customers, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts. Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our customers and clients of our customers. While we take measures to protect the security of, and unauthorized access to, our systems, as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow or those systems of our customers into which we operate and rely upon, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nData privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services and continue to develop in ways which we cannot predict. We are subject to U.S. federal and state laws regarding data privacy and security including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. We are also subject to foreign data privacy and security laws, including the Global Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the European Union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights. The GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sophia, Bulgaria and could be affected due to multiple weather risks, including risks to our Florida facility from hurricanes and similar phenomena.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sophia, Bulgaria and could be affected by multiple weather risks. Most notably hurricanes in Clearwater, Florida. Although we carry property and casualty insurance and business interruption insurance, future possible disruptions of operations or damage to property, plant and equipment due to hurricanes or other weather risks could result in impaired production and affect our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and impair important business relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. We do however maintain a backup generator at our Clearwater facility and a disaster recovery plan is in place to help mitigate this risk.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol \u201cAPYX\u201d.

These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, future sales by our security holders may lower the price of our common stock, which could result in losses to our stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of such sales occurring, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Substantially all of our common stock is freely tradable in\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nthe public market without restriction under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock and, even if we change that policy, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and invest in our business. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nIf we change that policy and commence paying dividends, we will not be obligated to continue paying those dividends and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. If we commence paying dividends in the future, our board of directors may decide, in its discretion, at any time, to decrease the amount of dividends, otherwise modify or repeal the dividend policy or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware law, our board of directors may not authorize the payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our statutory surplus.\nExercise of options issued by us will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our outstanding stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants amounted to 3,966,858 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 11.6% of our outstanding common stock.\nThe exercise of some or all of our stock options will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89891, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "APYX"}
