{"cik": "1358190", "company": "IT TECH PACKAGING, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Substantially all of our revenues and workforce are concentrated in China. In response to the intensifying efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government took a number of actions, which included extending the Chinese New Year holiday, quarantining individuals suspected of having COVID-19, asking residents in China to stay at home and to avoid public gathering, among other things. During the early part of 2020, COVID-19 caused temporary closure of our CMP production, and as a result, our revenue of CMP decreased by 49.89%.in the first quarter of 2020. It is, however, still unclear how the pandemic will evolve going forward, and we cannot assure you whether the COVID-19 pandemic will again bring about significant negative impact on our business operations, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to negative impact to our total revenues.\nWhile we have resumed business operations, there remain significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak and its further development as a global pandemic. Hence, the extent of the business disruption and the related impact on our financial results and outlook for 2021 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken globally to contain the corona virus or treat its impact, among others. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from all such possible events. We are still assessing our business operations and the total impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally.\nOur operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nDongfang Paper commenced its current line of business operations in 1996 and received its initial Pollution Discharge Permit in September 1996, which must be renewed every year for Dongfang Paper to stay in business. Although we have never had problem renewing the Pollution Discharge Permit, we cannot guarantee automatic renewal every year. In addition, Baoding Shengde commenced its current line of business operations in 2009. Therefore, our operating history may not provide a more meaningful basis on which to evaluate its business. We cannot assure you that Dongfang Paper or Baoding Shengde will not incur net losses in the future. We expect that operating expenses of Dongfang Paper and Baoding Shengde will increase as they expand. Any significant failure to realize anticipated revenue growth could result in significant operating losses. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies at a similar stage of development, including our potential failure to:\n\u25cf raise adequate capital for expansion and operations;\n\u25cf implement our business model and strategy and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u25cf increase awareness of our brand name, protect our reputation and develop customer loyalty;\n\u25cf manage our expanding operations and service offerings, including the integration of any future acquisitions;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of our expenses; or\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in paper markets in which we operate as well as the impact of any changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are not successful in addressing any or all of these risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nDongfang Paper and Baoding Shengde\u2019s failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThrough Dongfang Paper and Baoding Shengde, we compete in a highly developed market with companies that have significantly greater experience and history in our industry. If we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and experience reduced selling prices, adversely affecting our financial results. Our competitors will expand in the key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth.\nIf our business and markets grow and develop, it will be necessary for us to finance and manage expansion in an orderly fashion. An expansion would increase demands on existing management, workforce and facilities. Failure to satisfy such increased demands could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause delay in production and delivery of our paper products, as well as administrative inefficiencies.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, may review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement the current product offerings of Dongfang Paper, augment its market coverage or enhance its technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time we review investments in new businesses and we, through our subsidiaries, expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products, or technologies in the future. We expect that when we raise funds from investors for any of these purposes we will be either the issuer or the primary obligor while the proceeds will be forwarded to Dongfang Paper. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u25cf issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf incur substantial debt;\n\u25cf assume contingent liabilities; or\n\u25cf expend significant cash.\nThese actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits. Acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies and/or products;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering markets in which Dongfang Paper has no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations; and\n\u25cf substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technology, or personnel that we might acquire in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our and/or Dongfang Paper\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nOur Articles of Incorporation provides for the indemnification and/or exculpation of our directors, officers, employees, agents and other entities which deal with us to the maximum extent provided, and under the terms provided, by the laws and decisions of the courts of the state of Nevada. Although we do maintain professional error and omission insurance for the officers and directors, due to limitations of the insurance coverage these indemnification provisions could still result in substantial expenditures which we may be unable to recoup through the insurance and could adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Zhenyong Liu, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Jing Hao, our Chief Financial Officer, Dahong Zhou, our Secretary, and Marco Ku Hon Wai, Wenbing Christopher Wang, Lusha Niu, and Fuzeng Liu, our directors, are key personnel with rights to indemnification under our Articles of Incorporation.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and paper factory operational expertise of key personnel. Zhenyong Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Jing Hao, our Chief Financial Officer, Dahong Zhou, our Secretary, and Shuting Liang, Dongfang Paper\u2019s General Engineer, Gengqi Yang, Dongfang Paper\u2019s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Xuetao Chen, Dongfang Paper\u2019s Vice President of Environmental Protection and Xiaodong Liu, Baoding Shengde\u2019s General Manager, perform key functions in the operation of our business. There can be no assurance that IT Tech Packaging, Dongfang Paper or Baoding Shengde will be able to retain these officers after the term of their employment contracts expire. The loss of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not carry key man life insurance for any of our key personnel or personnel nor do we foresee purchasing such insurance to protect against a loss of key personnel and personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the services of Mr. Zhenyong Liu for the continued growth and operation of our Company because of his experience in the industry and his personal and business contacts in the PRC. Although Mr. Liu has entered into an employment agreement with Baoding Shengde, our wholly owned subsidiary and a PRC company, and that we have no reason to believe that Mr. Liu will discontinue his services with us or Dongfang Paper, the interruption or loss of his services would adversely affect our ability to effectively run our business and pursue our business strategy as well as our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to support our growth and if we are unable to retain or hire these personnel in the future, our ability to improve our products and implement our business objectives could be adversely affected.\nWe must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees. Competition for senior management and senior personnel in the PRC is intense, the pool of qualified candidates in the PRC is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or senior personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or senior personnel in the future. This failure could materially and adversely affect our future growth and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the costs of paper products and development;\n\u25cf the relative speed and success with which we can obtain and maintain customers, merchants and vendors for our products;\n\u25cf capital expenditure for equipment;\n\u25cf marketing and promotional activities and other costs;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies, suppliers and competitors;\n\u25cf the ability of our suppliers to provide products in a timely manner to their customers;\n\u25cf changes in operating expenses;\n\u25cf increased competition in the paper markets; and\n\u25cf other general economic and seasonal factors.\nWe face risks related to product liability claims.\nWe presently do not maintain product liability insurance. We face the risk of loss because of adverse publicity associated with product liability lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. We may not be able to avoid such claims. Although product liability lawsuits in the PRC are rare, and we have not, to date, experienced significant failure of our products, there is no guarantee that we will not face such liability in the future. This liability could be substantial and the occurrence of such loss or liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur operating results also depend on the availability and pricing of energy and raw materials.\nIn addition to our dependence upon wood pulp, recycled white scrap paper and paperboard costs, our operating results depend on the availability and pricing of energy and other raw materials. An interruption in the supply of supplemental chemical agents could cause a material disruption at our mill. In addition, an interruption in the supply of natural gas could cause a material disruption at our facilities. At present, our raw materials including natural gas are purchased from a number of suppliers, of which the three largest suppliers account for over 89% of all purchases. If any of these contracts were to be terminated for any reason, or not renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions were to substantially change creating a significant increase in the price of natural gas and recycled paper, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of providing coal to us on terms or in amounts satisfactory to us.\nWe replaced all the coal boilers with natural gas boiler in September 2017, but due to the gas consumption rise significantly, the government will from time to time issue mandated restriction/suspension of natural gas supply for all natural gas consumption industries, including the paper manufacturing industry in order to secure adequate natural gas to households uses in urban and rural areas. We are subject to the risks of natural gas supply restriction and above-mentioned factors. As a result, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our net income.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u25cf maintenance outages;\n\u25cf prolonged power failures;\n\u25cf an equipment failure, including any malfunction of our waste water treatment facilities;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of raw materials, such as wood fiber, energy, or chemicals;\n\u25cf a chemical spill or release;\n\u25cf closure because of environmental-related concerns;\n\u25cf explosion of a boiler;\n\u25cf the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on our water supply;\n\u25cf disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and tunnels;\n\u25cf fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, epidemic or other catastrophes;\n\u25cf terrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\u25cf labor difficulties; or\n\u25cf other operational problems.\nIf any of the abovementioned events were to occur, we may be unable to meet customer demand, which may adversely affect our sales and net income.\nOur certificates, permits, and licenses related to our papermaking operations are subject to governmental control and renewal and failure to obtain renewal will cause all or part of our operations to be terminated.\nIn 1988, the National Environmental Protection Bureau issued Interim Measures on the Administration of Water Pollutants Discharge Permits, requiring all companies discharging pollution into the water as a direct or indirect byproduct of production to adhere to certain caps on pollution discharge. On January 24, 2021, the State Council issued Regulations on the Administration of Pollutant Discharge Permits, which has effected on March 1, 2022.Additionally, such companies were required to obtain and annually renew a Pollution Discharge Permit in order to conduct their operations. The PRC government has the authority to shut down a company\u2019s operations for its failure to maintain a valid permit. We renewed our Pollution Discharge Permit in June 2020. Our latest permit is effective from June 28, 2020 through June 27, 2025. Pollution discharge Permit for Hebei Tengsheng was effective from August 10, 2021 through August 9, 2026. An application to renew will be filed by us with the local environment protection agency before the expiration.\nThe failure by us to obtain any certificate, permit, and license necessary for our operations or the failure by us to obtain the renewal of any such certificate, permit or license may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nCompliance with environmental regulations is expensive, and noncompliance may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspension of our business operations.\nWe are required to comply with all Chinese national and local regulations regarding the protection of the environment. Compliance with environmental regulation is expensive. The Chinese government is adopting even more stringent environmental protection and operational safety regulations and the costs of complying with these regulations are expected to increase. Although we have obtained all of the necessary approvals and permits for our production facilities currently existing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all applicable environmental protection and operational safety requirements, and obtain all of the required governmental approvals and permits that may be or may become applicable to us on a timely basis, or at all, or will be able to complete all our registrations and filings with the government, in time for our future projects. The relevant governmental authorities may impose on us fines for any non-compliance, set deadlines for rectification, and order us to cease construction or production if we fail to comply with their requirements.\nIf we are unable to respond to pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, from time to time we have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have available sufficient financial or other resources to continue to make investments necessary to maintain our competitive position.\nIf we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to develop new products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demand. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that make our existing products obsolete, could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions.\nAs the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, insurance companies in China currently offer limited business insurance products. We do not have any product liability insurance or business interruption insurance. Based on the insurance products available in China, even if we decide to take out business interruption coverage, such insurance as currently available offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other jurisdictions. Any business disruption, natural disaster, or product liability claim could result in our incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and external infringements of our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees, contractors and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, confidentiality and license arrangements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for some of our properties. Infringement of intellectual property rights continues to pose a serious risk of doing business.\nWe may in the future file, patent applications on certain of our innovations. It is possible, however, that these innovations may not be patentable. In addition, given the cost, effort and risks associated with patent application, we may choose not to seek patent protection for some innovations. Furthermore, our patent applications may not lead to granted patents, the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient or an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also cannot guarantee that any of our present or future patents or other intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or abandoned.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market offerings similar to ours and our ability to compete effectively would be impaired. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and diversion of management resources. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigations. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigations, and, even if we do prevail, we may not obtain a meaningful relief. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent external parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. Any intellectual property that we own may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by external parties.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by external parties. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims alleging infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats, or other infringement of proprietary, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related To Doing Business in the PRC\nThe PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of a PRC company\u2019s business operations or to exert control over any offering of securities conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, and may intervene with or influence our operations, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless, as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals.\nThe PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock. For example, the PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding any industry that could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. Furthermore, the PRC government has also recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over securities offerings and other capital markets activities that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based companies. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless.\nRecently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cyber security reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.\nOur business may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cyber security and data protection.\nOur business may be subject to PRC laws relating to the collection, use, sharing, retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. These laws continue to develop, and the PRC government may adopt other rules and restrictions in the future. Non-compliance could result in penalties or other significant legal liabilities.\nPursuant to the PRC Cyber security Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress on November 7, 2016 and took effect on June 1, 2017, personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services that affects or may affect national security, it should be subject to cyber security review by the Cyberspace Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d). Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of \u201ccritical information infrastructure operator\u201d remains unclear.\nOn April 13, 2020, twelve Chinese government agencies jointly promulgated the Measures for Cyber security Review (2020 version) (\u201cOld Measures\u201d), which became effective on June 1, 2020, set forth the cyber security review mechanism for critical information infrastructure operators, and provided that critical information infrastructure operators (\u201cCIIOs\u201d) who intend to procure network products and services that affect or may affect national security shall be subject to a cyber security review. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides for a security review procedure for the data activities that may affect national security. Moreover, the CAC issued the Measures of Cyber security Review (Revised Draft for Comments) on July 10, 2021, which requires operators with personal information of more than one million users who want to list abroad to file a cyber security review with the CAC. Furthermore, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown on Illegal Securities Activities, which was available to the public on July 6, 2021. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies. These opinions proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, to deal with the risks and incidents facing China-based overseas-listed companies and the demand for cyber security and data privacy protection.\nThe Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for entities and individuals handling personal data, including that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal means, and the collection and use of such data should not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, PRC Cyber security Law and any other cyber security and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, if the enacted version of the Measures for Cyber security Review mandates clearance of cyber security review and other specific actions to be completed by companies like us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.\nOn January 4, 2022, the CAC issued the revised Measures on Cyberspace Security Review (the \u201cRevised Measures\u201d)that has came into effect on February 15, 2022, which required that, among others, in addition to \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure,\u201d any \u201cnetwork platform operator data processor\u201d controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cyber security review. We do not believe we are among the \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d or \u201cnetwork platform operator data processor\u201d who control over one million personal information as mentioned above; however, the definition of \u201cnetwork platform operator\u201d is unclear. The revised draft of the Measures for Cyber security Review is in the process of being formulated and it is also unclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. The Revised Measures also establish a Cyber security Review Office (the \u201cCRO\u201d), an administrative body within the CAC, to formulate the regulations for cyber security review and to lead the cyber security review process. Applicable CIIOs and NP operators are required to submit an application to the CRO, and the CRO will assess whether a cyber security review is required.\nAs these laws, opinions and the measures were recently issued, official guidance and interpretation of these remain unclear in several respects at this time, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, opinions and the measures. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the future regulatory changes would impose additional restrictions on our business.\nWe believe that we are currently not be subject to the cyber security review by the CAC, given the factors discussed above. However, there remains uncertainty as to how the Revised Measures will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Revised Measures. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us.\nWe cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do. In the event that we are subject to any mandatory cyber security review and other specific actions required by the CAC, we face uncertainty as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required to suspend our relevant business, or face other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nOur business operations, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The PRC has operated as a socialist state since the middle of the 20th century and is controlled by the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. The PRC has only permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities since 1978. The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy, including the paper industry, through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under its current leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nPolicies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nA change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than three decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social life.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations may harm our business.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. The PRC\u2019s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business, the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements with our VIE, Dongfang Paper, and its shareholders, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. Our major operating entity, Dongfang Paper, conducts its operations in China, and as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business. If the relevant authorities find that we are in violation of PRC laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf levying fines;\n\u25cf revoking Dongfang Paper\u2019s business and other licenses;\n\u25cf requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and\n\u25cf requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business.\nAmong the material laws that we are subject to are the Price Law of The People\u2019s Republic of China, Measurement Law of The People\u2019s Republic of China, Tax Law, Environmental Protection Law, Contract Law, Patent Law, Accounting Laws and Labor Law.\nA slowdown, inflation or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and products.\nAll of our operations are conducted in the PRC and all of our revenue is generated from sales in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, we cannot assure you that this growth will continue. In 2021, China\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) growth rate was 8.1% as compared to 2.3% in 2020. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our products and harm our business.\nAdditionally, while the PRC economy experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth could lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may harm our profitability. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credit, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Such an austere policy can lead to a slowing of economic growth.\nWe may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC Subsidiary to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nIT Tech Packaging Inc. is a Nevada holding company and conducts all of its business through its operating subsidiaries and the VIE. IT Tech Packaging Inc. relies principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC Subsidiary for cash requirements, including for services of any debt IT Tech Packaging Inc. may incur.\nOur PRC Subsidiary\u2019s ability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC Subsidiary to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. If our PRC Subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC Subsidiary to distribute dividends or other payments to its shareholders could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are incorporated.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of investors\u2019 investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive a significant portion of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our Nevada holding company may rely on dividend payments from our PRC Subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary in China may be used to pay dividends to our Nevada holding company.\nHowever, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary and VIE to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi.\nThe PRC government has imposed more restrictive foreign exchange policies and stepped up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement including overseas direct investment. More restrictions and substantial vetting process are put in place by SAFE to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. The PRC government may at its discretion further restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders of our common stock.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAny funds IT Tech Packaging Inc. transfers to its PRC Subsidiary, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to approval by or registration with relevant governmental authorities in China. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, in China, capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiary are subject to the approval of or report investment information to the MOFCOM or their respective local branches and registration with a local bank authorized by the SAFE. In addition, any foreign loan procured by our PRC Subsidiary cannot exceed statutory limits and is required to be registered with SAFE or its local branches. Any medium or long-term loan to be provided by IT Tech Packaging Inc. to the VIE must be registered with the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, and the SAFE or its local branches. We may not be able to complete such registrations on a timely basis, with respect to future capital contributions or foreign loans by IT Tech Packaging Inc. to its PRC Subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations, our ability to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.\nOn March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach Regarding the Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which took effect on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 19 launched a nationwide reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of FIEs and allows FIEs to settle their foreign exchange capital at their discretion, but continues to prohibit FIEs from using the Renminbi fund converted from their foreign exchange capital for expenditure beyond their business scopes, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between nonfinancial enterprises. The SAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16, effective in June 2016. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 16, enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. SAFE Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in China. SAFE Circular 16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, while such converted Renminbi shall not be provided as loans to its non-affiliated entities. As this circular is relatively new, there remains uncertainty as to its interpretation and application and any other future foreign exchange related rules. Violations of these Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to fund the establishment of new entities in China by the VIE, to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies through our PRC Subsidiary, or to establish new consolidated VIE in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and complies with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry this out in practice.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by IT Tech Packaging to its PRC Subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions by IT Tech Packaging Inc. to its PRC Subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may harm your investment.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. According to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, as of December 31, 2021, $1 is converted into 6.3757Yuan (RMB). As we rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC, any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into Renminbi for Dongfang Paper\u2019s operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and this could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations because it would reduce the proceeds available to us for capital investment in proportion to the appreciation of the Renminbi. Thus, if we raise 1,000,000 U.S. dollars and the Renminbi appreciates against the U.S. dollar by 15%, then the proceeds will be worth only RMB5,544,087 as opposed to RMB 6,375,700 prior to the appreciation. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common shares or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Renminbi, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Renminbi we convert would be reduced in proportion to the amount the U.S. dollar appreciates. In addition, the depreciation of significant RMB denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the dollar value of these assets. Thus, if Dongfang Paper has RMB1,000,000 in assets and Renminbi is depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 15%, then the assets will be valued at $136,387 as opposed to $156,846 prior to the depreciation.\nOn July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy resulted in an approximately 2.44% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2021. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant depreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may materially adversely affect us.\nThe PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, effective on July 14, 2014, and its appendixes, that require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of the SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in their ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.\nBecause of uncertainty over the interpretation of Circular 37, we cannot assure you that, if challenged by government agencies, the structure of our organization has fully complied with all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 37. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 37 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. A failure by such PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with Circular 37, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWhile the approval and/or other requirements of the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities are currently not required, they may be required, in connection with our oversea listing under PRC rules, regulations or policies, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or how soon we will be able to obtain such approval.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (\u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and then was further amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that purport to require offshore SPVs formed for the purpose of listing and controlled by PRC individuals or companies, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nIn addition, the PRC government authorities may strengthen oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas. For instance, on July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC governmental authorities promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, which emphasized the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by PRC companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, are to be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-based overseas-listed companies, cyber security and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. The Measures for Cyber security Review issued by the CAC on January 4, 2022 also required that, among others, \u201ccritical information infrastructure\u201d or internet platform operator holding over one million users\u2019 personal information to apply for a cyber security review before any listing at a foreign country. These statements and regulations are recently issued and there remain substantial uncertainties about their interpretation and implementation.\nOn December 24, 2021, CSRC issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the \u201cAdministration Provisions\u201d), and the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the \u201cMeasures\u201d), which are open for public comments by January 23, 2022. The Administration Provisions and Measures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory coordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out relevant security screening procedures if their businesses involve supervisions such as foreign investment security and cyber security reviews. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. According to Relevant Officials of the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions (\u201cCSRC Answers\u201d), after the Administration Provisions and Measures are implemented upon completion of public consultation and due legislative procedures, the CSRC will formulate and issue guidance for filing procedures to further specify the details of filing administration and ensure that market entities could refer to clear guidelines for filing, which means it will still take time to put the Administration Provisions and Measures into effect. As the Administration Provisions and Measures have not yet come into effect, we are currently unaffected by them. However, according to CSRC Answers, only new initial public offerings and refinancing by existing overseas listed Chinese companies will be required to go through the filing process; other existing overseas listed companies will be allowed a sufficient transition period to complete their filing procedure. However, it is uncertain when the Administration Provision and the Measures will take effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted.\nWe believe that, as of the date of this annual report, we are not required to obtain any permission from PRC authorities to operate and issue securities to foreign investors, including permissions from the CSRC or CAC. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in the future in connection with the listing or continued listing of our securities on NYSE American, or even in the event such permission or approval is required and obtained, the approval could be subsequently revoked or rescinded. Any failure to obtain or a delay in obtaining the necessary permissions from the PRC authorities to conduct offerings or listing outside of China may subject us to sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory authorities. If we do not receive or maintain the approvals, or we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our company\u2019s securities, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions or regulatory objection to our operations from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities, and our PRC Subsidiary and the VIE have obtained all requisite permissions from PRC governmental authorities to operate our business as currently conducted under relevant PRC laws and regulations and no permissions have been denied by governmental authorities.\nThe M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nAmong other things, the M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. Such regulation requires, among other things, that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council in 2008, are triggered. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the anti-monopoly law enforcement authority shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the State Council that became effective in March 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement.\nIn the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal and judicial system may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors.\nThe PRC legal and judicial system may negatively impact foreign investors. In 1982, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Constitution of China to authorize foreign investment and guarantee the \u201clawful rights and interests\u201d of foreign investors in the PRC. However, the PRC\u2019s system of laws is not yet comprehensive. The legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is inconsistent. Many judges in the PRC lack the depth of legal training and experience that would be expected of a judge in a more developed country. Because the PRC judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing the laws that do exist, anticipation of judicial decision-making is more uncertain than would be expected in a more developed country. It may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on the civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes; a decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes.\nThe trend of legislation over the last 20 years has significantly enhanced the protection of foreign investment and allowed for more control by foreign parties of their investments in Chinese enterprises. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. A change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic or social life, may affect the PRC government\u2019s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe practical effect of the PRC legal system on our business operations in the PRC can be viewed from two separate but intertwined considerations. First, as a matter of substantive law, the foreign invested enterprise laws provide significant protection from government interference. In addition, these laws guarantee the full enjoyment of the benefits of corporate articles and contracts to foreign invested enterprise participants. These laws, however, do impose standards concerning corporate formation and governance, which are qualitatively different from the general corporation laws of the United States. Similarly, the PRC accounting laws mandate accounting practices, which are not consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. PRC\u2019s accounting laws require that an annual \u201cstatutory audit\u201d be performed in accordance with PRC accounting standards and that the books of account of foreign invested enterprises are maintained in accordance with Chinese accounting laws. Article 14 of the People\u2019s Republic of China Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law requires a wholly foreign-owned enterprise to submit certain periodic fiscal reports and statements to designated financial and tax authorities, at the risk of business license revocation. While the enforcement of substantive rights may appear less clear than United States procedures, foreign invested enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises are Chinese registered companies, which enjoy the same status as other Chinese registered companies in business-to-business dispute resolution. Any award rendered by an arbitration tribunal is enforceable in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). Therefore, as a practical matter, although no assurances can be given, the Chinese legal infrastructure, while different in operation from its United States counterpart, should not present any significant impediment to the operation of foreign invested enterprises.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and most of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to effect service of legal process, enforce your rights based on U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers or to enforce U.S. court judgment against us or them in the PRC.\nAll of our directors and officers reside outside the United States. In addition, our operating company is located in the PRC and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties, under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigations initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by our investors in protecting their interests.\nWe may be required to broaden the coverage of the mandatory social security insurance programs under the Labor Law of the PRC.\nThe PRC Labor Law, effective January 1, 2008, requires that employers enroll in the following social security insurance programs and offer certain employer-sponsored premium benefits to eligible employees: (1) retirement endowment, (2) healthcare insurance, (3) unemployment insurance, (4) workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and (5) pregnancy insurance. Of these insurance programs, the retirement endowment fund requires employee withholdings of 4% to 8% of the gross compensation, while the employer\u2019s matching contribution varies from 16% to 20% of such compensation. While the Company is enrolled in the retirement endowment fund and is withholding employees\u2019 portion and the employer\u2019s portion of the endowment contribution, many of the Company\u2019s employees have elected to waive their coverage under these mandatory social security insurance programs in favor of certain other low-cost, local government-sponsored social security insurance programs for residents in non-urban districts. Although we have verified with the local government agencies for the validity of the employee waivers and reasonably believe that we are not required to cover the employees who waived the benefits, the local government may change its policy and ask us to broaden our insurance coverage to those who have specifically waived their rights.\nThe current tensions in international trade and rising political tensions, particularly between U.S. and China, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough cross-border business may not be an area of our focus, if we plan to expand our business internationally in the future, any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our products and services, impact our competitive position, or prevent us from being able to conduct business in certain countries. If any new tariffs, legislation, or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Recently, there have been heightened tensions in international economic relations, such as the one between the United States and China. The U.S. government has recently imposed, and has recently proposed to impose additional, new, or higher tariffs on certain products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. China has responded by imposing, and proposing to impose additional, new, or higher tariffs on certain products imported from the United States. Following mutual retaliatory actions for months, on January 15, 2020, the United States and China entered into the Economic and Trade Agreement between the United States of America and the People\u2019s Republic of China as a phase one trade deal, effective on February 14, 2020.\nIn addition, political tensions between the United States and China have escalated due to, among other things, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the PRC central government and the executive orders issued by U.S. President Donald J. Trump in August 2020 that prohibit certain transactions with certain Chinese companies and their applications. Rising political tensions could reduce levels of trades, investments, technological exchanges and other economic activities between the two major economies, which would have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the direct impact of the current international trade tensions and political tensions between the United States and China, and any escalation of such tensions, on the paper making industry in China is uncertain, the negative impact on general, economic, political and social conditions may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s national legislative body (the \u201cNPC\u201d) approved the Foreign Investment Law, which became effective on January 1, 2020. Since it is relatively new, uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and its implementation rules that are yet to be issued. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under the definition of \u201cforeign investment\u201d that includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. There can be no assurance that our control over our consolidated VIEs through contractual arrangements will not be deemed as a foreign investment in the future.\nThe Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries specified as either \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d from foreign investment in the Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List), which was approved by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and issued by the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce with an effective date of July 30, 2019and renew on January 1, 2022. The Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. If our control over our consolidated VIEs through contractual arrangements are deemed as foreign investment in the future, and any business of our consolidated VIEs is considered \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d from foreign investment under the \u201cnegative list\u201d effective at the time, we may be deemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over our consolidated VIEs may be deemed as invalid and illegal, and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and/or restructure our business operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operation.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations.\nAny failure by our consolidated VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe, through our wholly foreign-owned enterprise in the PRC, have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with our consolidated VIEs and their shareholders. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see \u201cOverview and Corporation History.\u201d If our consolidated VIEs or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in the consolidated VIEs to us or our designee when we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. In addition, if there are any disputes or governmental proceedings involving any interest in such shareholders\u2019 equity interests in our VIEs, our ability to exercise shareholders\u2019 rights or foreclose the equity interest pledges according to the contractual arrangements may be impaired. If these disputes or proceedings were to impair our control over our VIEs, we may not be able to maintain effective control over our business operations in the PRC and thus would not be able to continue to consolidate our VIEs\u2019 financial results, which would in turn result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our businesses through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have controlling ownership.\nWe do not have direct or indirect equity ownership of Dongfang Paper which operates a majority of our business. Although we have entered into contractual arrangements with Dongfang Paper and its individual owners pursuant to which we receive an economic interest in Dongfang Paper, and exert a controlling influence over Dongfang Paper, in a manner substantially similar to a controlling equity interest, these contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over Dongfang Paper as direct ownership. For example, Dongfang Paper may be unwilling or unable to perform their contractual obligations under our commercial agreements, including payment of consulting fees under the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement as they become due. If that were to occur, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under the contractual arrangements insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under Chinese law may be inadequate. Furthermore, Dongfang Paper may seek to renew their agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire, or to enter into similar agreements with other parties, we will lose control of Dongfang Paper.\nBecause we rely on the consulting services agreement with Dongfang Paper for essentially all of our revenue and cash flows, any difficulty for Dongfang Paper to pay consulting fees to Baoding Shengde under the consulting agreement may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are a holding company and currently conduct business through Dongfang Paper in China. As a result, we rely on payments from the consulting services agreement which forms a part of the contractual arrangements between Baoding Shengde and Dongfang Paper. Since Baoding Shengde is not a legal shareholder of Dongfang Paper under PRC statutes, the arrangement for Dongfang Paper to pay a substantial portion of its net income to Baoding Shengde may be challenged by the PRC government, which could prevent us from receiving required funds or making required payments to some of our service providers.\nIf the PRC government determines that the contractual agreements constituting part of our VIE structure do not comply with applicable PRC regulations , or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we may be unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of the VIE, and our common stock may decline in value.\nRecently, the PRC government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in China, including those related to variable interest entities. There are currently no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC that prohibit companies whose entity interests are within the PRC from listing on overseas stock exchanges. Although we believe that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements comply with current applicable PRC laws and regulations, in the event that PRC government determines that the contractual arrangements constituting part of our VIE structure do not comply with PRC regulations, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we may be unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of the VIE, and our common stock may decline in value or be worthless. Additionally, our common stock may decline in value or become worthless if we are unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of our PRC Subsidiary that conducts all or substantially all of our business operations.\nThe contractual arrangements under a VIE Structure may not be as effective as direct ownership in respect of our relationship with the VIE, and thus, we may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements, which we may not be able to enforce at all.\nThe contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in respect of our relationship with the VIE. For example, the VIE and its shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of the VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of the VIE, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the VIE Agreements, we rely on the performance by the VIE and its shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over the VIE. The shareholders of the consolidated VIE may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the contractual arrangements with the VIE.\nIf the VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. For example, if the shareholders of the VIE refuse to transfer their equity interest in the VIE to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to the contractual arrangements, or if they otherwise act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. In addition, if any third parties claim any interest in such shareholders\u2019 equity interests in the VIE, our ability to exercise shareholders\u2019 rights or foreclose the share pledge according to the contractual arrangements may be impaired. If these or other disputes between the shareholders of the VIE and third parties were to impair our relationship with the VIE, our ability to consolidate the financial results of the VIE would be affected, which would in turn result in a material adverse effect on the business, operations and financial condition.\nThe shareholders of Dongfang Paper may have actual or potential conflicts of interests with us, which may adversely affect our business.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we are not aware of any conflicts between the shareholders of the VIE and IT Tech Packaging. However, the shareholders of Dongfang Paper, the VIE, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with IT Tech Packaging in the future. These shareholders may refuse to sign or breach, or cause the VIE to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements IT Tech Packaging has with them and the VIE, which would have a material and adverse effect on IT Tech Packaging\u2019 ability to effectively control the VIE and receive economic benefits from them. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause IT Tech\u2019 agreements with the VIE to be performed in a manner adverse to IT Tech Packaging by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to IT Tech Packaging on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of IT Tech Packagingor such conflicts will be resolved in IT Tech Packaging\u2019s favor. Currently, IT Tech Packaging does not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and IT Tech Packaging. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between IT Tech Packaging and these shareholders, IT Tech Packaging would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of IT Tech Packaging\u2019s business and subject IT Tech Packaging to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nOur Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 5.4% shareholder, Zhenyong Liu, owns 93.39% of the equity interest in Dongfang Paper. Conflicts of interests between his duties to IT Tech and to Dongfang Paper may arise. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, he will act in the best interests of IT Tech or that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. These conflicts may result in management decisions that could negatively affect our operations and potentially result in the loss of opportunities.\nWe may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by the VIE that are material to the operation of its business if the entity goes bankrupt or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.\nAs part of our contractual arrangements with the VIE, the entity holds certain assets that are material to the operation of our business, including permits, domain names and IP rights. If the VIE goes bankrupt and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of its business activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under the contractual arrangements, the VIE may not, in any manner, sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of its assets or legal or beneficial interests in the business without our prior consent. If the VIE undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, the independent third party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur arrangements with Dongfang Paper and its shareholders may be subject to a transfer pricing adjustment by the PRC tax authorities which could have an adverse effect on our income and expenses.\nWe could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our contracts with Dongfang Paper and its shareholders were not entered into based on arm\u2019s length negotiations. If the PRC tax authorities determine that these contracts were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. Such an adjustment may require that we pay additional PRC taxes plus applicable penalties and interest, if any.\nWe may lose the ability to use, or otherwise benefit from, the licenses, approvals and assets held by the VIE, which could severely disrupt our business, render us unable to conduct some of our business operations and constrain our growth.\nIT Tech Packaging relies on contractual arrangements with the VIE to use, or otherwise benefit from, certain foreign restricted licenses and permits that it needs or may need in the future as its business continues to expand. The contractual arrangements contain terms that specifically obligate the VIE\u2019s shareholders to ensure the valid existence of the VIE and restrict the disposal of material assets of the VIE. However, in the event the VIE\u2019s shareholders breach the terms of these contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidate the VIE, or the VIE declares bankruptcy and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, or is otherwise disposed of without IT Tech\u2019s consent, IT Tech may be unable to conduct its business operations or otherwise benefit from the assets held by the VIE, which could have an adverse effect on IT Tech\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the VIE undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of the assets of the VIE, thereby hindering IT Tech\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nThe exercise of our option to purchase part or all of the equity interests in Dongfang Paper under the Call Option Agreement might be subject to approval by the PRC government. Our failure to obtain this approval may impair our ability to substantially control Dongfang Paper and could result in actions by Dongfang Paper that conflict with our interests.\nOur Call Option Agreement with Dongfang Paper and its shareholders gives our Chinese subsidiary, Baoding Shengde or its designated entity or natural person, the option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Dongfang Paper. The option may not be exercised by Baoding Shengde if the exercise would violate any applicable laws and regulations in China or cause any license or permit held by, and necessary for the operation of Dongfang Paper, to be cancelled or invalidated. Under the laws of China, if a foreign entity, through a foreign investment company that it invests in, acquires a domestic related company, China\u2019s regulations regarding mergers and acquisitions may technically apply to the transaction. If these regulations apply, an examination and approval of the transaction by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), or its local counterparts would be required. In addition, an appraisal of the equity interest or the assets to be acquired would also be mandatory. Since the scope of business activities (making of cultural paper products) as defined in the business license of Baoding Shengde does not involve the MOFCOM approval and monitoring, we do not believe at this time that an approval or an appraisal is required for Baoding Shengde to exercise its option to acquire Dongfang Paper. In light of the different views on this issue, however, it is possible that the central MOFCOM office in Beijing will issue a standardized opinion imposing the approval and appraisal requirement. If we are not able to purchase the equity of Dongfang Paper, then we will lose a substantial portion of our ability to control Dongfang Paper and our ability to ensure that Dongfang Paper will act in our interests.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to investing in our securities.\nOn April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.\nOn May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply a minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in a \u201cRestrictive Market,\u201d (ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or the board of directors for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditor. We are very likely to be deemed as a company primarily operating in a Restrictive Market under such proposed rules of Nasdaq. Therefore, Nasdaq might apply the additional and more stringent criteria for our initial and continued listing, which might cause delay or even denial of our listing application.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company\u2019s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer\u2019s securities are prohibited to trade on a national exchange. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction, and will also require disclosure in the registrant\u2019s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (\u201cAHFCAA\u201d), which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act from three years to two.\nOn September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted rules to create a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions.\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People\u2019s Republic of China, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong.. The PCAOB has made such designations as mandated under the HFCAA. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB, the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms and thus are at risk of such suspensions in the future.\nThe PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors\u2019 audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate.\nOur auditor, WWC, P.C., Certified Public Accountants, is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, and as an auditor of publicly traded companies in the U.S., is subject to laws in the U.S. pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. WWC, P.C., Certified Public Accountants, is based in the United States and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis, with the last inspection in November 2021. WWC, P.C., Certified Public Accountants, is not headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong and was not identified as a firm subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. Should the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspection of our auditor\u2019s work papers in China, it will make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or equity control procedures. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures or quality of the financial statements, which would adversely affect us and our securities. Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange may determine to delist our securities.\nIf we fail to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of U.S. public companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. While we have not detected any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control and with respect to the assessment of the internal control for the year ended December 31, 2021, we cannot guarantee the implementation of controls and procedures in future years to be without any significant deficiency or material weakness.\nIf we become directly subject to the scrutiny involving U.S. listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and/or defend the matter, which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies. Much of the scrutiny has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial reporting and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed China-based companies that have been the subject of such scrutiny has sharply decreased in value. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions that are conducting internal and/or external investigations into the allegations. If we become the subject of any such scrutiny, whether any allegations are true or not, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. Such investigations or allegations will be costly and time-consuming and distract our management from our business plan and could result in our reputation being harmed and our stock price could decline as a result of such allegations, regardless of the truthfulness of the allegations.\nOur officers and directors control us through their positions and stock ownership and their interests may differ from other stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2021, there were 96,968,400 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Mr. Zhenyong Liu, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 4.7% of our common stock. As a result, he is able to influence the outcome of stockholder votes on various matters, including the election of directors and extraordinary corporate transactions including business combinations. Yet Mr. Liu\u2019s interests may differ from those of other stockholders. Furthermore, ownership of 4.7% of our common stock by Mr. Liu reduces the public float and liquidity, and may affect the market price, of our common stock as traded on the NYSE American.\nWe may not continue to pay cash dividends and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWhile we intend to retain the majority of any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, we did declare four quarterly cash dividends in April 2012 and November 2013. Although it is likely that our Board of Directors will continue the quarterly cash dividend as a regular dividend policy in the coming years, there is no guarantee that the cash dividend will not be discontinued or reduced. Should we decide to continue the cash dividend, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE American. Although a trading market has developed for our common stock, there can be no assurance that the trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Failure to maintain a trading market for our common stock may adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or at all. Our common stock has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture financings may dilute stockholders or impair our financial condition.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, which might include the sale of equity securities. The issuance of equity securities could result in financial and voting dilution to our existing stockholders. The issuance of debt could result in effective subordination of stockholders\u2019 interests to the debt, create the possibility of default, and limit our financial and business alternatives.", "PERMNO": 93177, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "ITP"}
