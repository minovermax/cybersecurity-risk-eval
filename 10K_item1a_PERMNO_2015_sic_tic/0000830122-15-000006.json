{"cik": "830122", "company": "PICO HOLDINGS INC /NEW", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following information sets out factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with other matters described in this Form 10-K or incorporated herein by reference in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, in some cases significantly.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition and our ability to grow our businesses.\nAll of our businesses are sensitive to general economic conditions, both nationally and locally, as well as international economic conditions. General poor economic conditions and the resulting effect of non-existent or slow rates of growth in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the demand for both our real estate and water assets and the canola oil and meal products from our canola seed crushing business. These poor economic conditions include higher unemployment, inflation, deflation, increased commodity costs, decreases in consumer demand, changes in buying patterns, a weakened dollar, higher transportation and fuel costs, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect commercial and residential real estate development and consumer demand for vegetable oil and meal products.\nSpecifically, high national or regional unemployment may arrest or delay any significant recovery of the residential real estate markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect the demand for our real estate and water assets. Any prolonged lack of demand for our real estate and water assets could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. Poor economic conditions could also lead to a decrease in consumer demand for canola oil products and / or a decline in canola seed crushing margins which could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future revenue is uncertain and depends on a number of factors that may make our revenue, profitability and cash flows volatile.\nOur future revenue and profitability related to our water resource and water storage operations will primarily be dependent on our ability to acquire, develop and sell or lease water assets. In light of the fact that our water resource and water storage operations represent a large percentage of our overall business at present, our long-term profitability will be affected by various factors, including the availability and timing of water resource acquisitions, drought in the southwest, regulatory approvals and permits associated with such acquisitions, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resource and water storage development projects. Moreover, our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic and technological factors as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets. Additionally, to the extent that we possess junior or conditional water rights, during extreme climatic conditions, such as periods of low flow or drought, our water rights could be subordinated to superior water rights holders. The factors described above are not within our control.\nOur future revenue and the growth of our land development and homebuilding activities depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire attractive land parcels for development of single-family homes at reasonable prices. Our ability to acquire land parcels for new single-family homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land prices at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. If the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of single-family homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow our land development and homebuilding business could be significantly limited, and our land development and homebuilding revenue and gross margin could remain static or decline.\nOur canola seed crushing facility only commenced full scale operations in the third quarter of 2012 and therefore has, to date, a limited operating history. Our canola crushing plant\u2019s future revenue and ability to operate profitably and to generate positive cash flows is primarily dependent on future market prices and conditions for canola seed, canola oil and canola meal as well as operating at or near maximum crushing capacity.\nThe operation of a canola crushing plant involves many risks which include: poor operating margins due to high commodity prices for canola seed; not obtaining and maintaining adequate canola seed supplies; cost overruns in excess of budgeted operational costs; an inability to maintain the crushing facility at efficient operating levels sufficient to generate positive cash flows including, but not limited to, factors such as inadequate supplies of canola seed, logistical issues in transporting seed to the plant and delivering canola and meal to customers, and breakdowns in the plant itself that will require repairs; and not maintaining and managing product price-risk efficiently. We must be able to sell the plant\u2019s products (canola oil and meal) at market prices that are sufficient to generate adequate cash flows to service the debt financing used to partly fund the construction of the facility and to provide working capital for our operations. Additionally, we must be able to sell the plant\u2019s products at prices that will allow us to generate an adequate and appropriate rate of return on our equity investment. Our canola crushing operations has a limited operating history as of December 31, 2014 and, to date, has not generated annual operating income or positive cash flows.\nOne or more of the above factors in one or more of our operating segments could impact our revenue and profitability, negatively affect our financial condition and cash flows, and cause our results of operations to be volatile.\nA downturn in the recent improvement that the homebuilding and land development industry has experienced would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained downturn in recent years having been impacted by factors that include, but are not limited to, weak general economic and employment growth, a lack of consumer confidence, large supplies of resale and foreclosed homes, a significant number of homeowners whose outstanding principal balance on their mortgage loan exceeds the market value of their home and tight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home. These factors resulted in an industry-wide weakness in demand for new homes and caused a material adverse effect on the growth of the local economies and the homebuilding industry in the southwestern U.S. markets where a substantial amount of our real estate and water assets are located, including the states of Nevada, Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, in 2012, we noted a significant improvement in the housing market which led to increased levels of real estate development activity. The continuation of the recent improvement in residential and commercial real estate development process and activity is essential for our ability to generate operating income in our water resource and water storage, and land development and homebuilding businesses. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent this recovery will continue or its timing. Any future slow-down in real estate and homebuilding activity could adversely impact various development projects within the markets in which our real estate and water assets are located and this could materially affect our ability to monetize these assets. Declines and weak conditions in the U.S. housing market have reduced our revenues and created losses in our water resource and water storage, and land development and homebuilding businesses in prior years and could do so in the future.\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated value of our real estate and water assets in our projected time frame, if at all.\nWe expect that the current rate of growth of the economy will continue to have an impact on real estate market fundamentals. Depending on how markets perform both in the short and long-term, the state of the economy, both nationally and locally in the markets where our assets are concentrated, could result in a decline in the value of our existing real estate and water assets, or result in our having to retain such assets for longer than we initially expected, which would negatively impact our rate of return on our real estate and water assets, cause us to divest such assets for less than our intended return on investment, or cause us to incur impairments on the book values of such assets to estimated fair value. Such events would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe fair values of our real estate and water assets are linked to growth factors concerning the local markets in which our assets are concentrated and may be impacted by broader economic issues.\nBoth the demand and fair value of our real estate and water assets are significantly affected by the growth in population and the general state of the local economies where our real estate and water assets are located. These local economies may be affected by factors such as the local level of employment and the availability of financing and interest rates, where (1) our real estate and water assets are located, primarily in Arizona and northern Nevada, but also in Colorado and New Mexico and (2) our land development and homebuilding assets are located, primarily in California and also Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The unemployment rate in these states, as well as issues related to the credit markets, may prolong a slowdown of the local economies where our real estate and water assets are located. This could materially and adversely affect the demand for and the fair value of our real estate and water assets and, consequently, adversely affect our growth and revenues, results of operations, cash flows and the return on our investment in these assets.\nThe fair values of our real estate and water assets may decrease which could adversely affect our results of operations by impairments and write-downs.\nThe fair value of our water resource and water storage assets and our land and homebuilding assets depends on market conditions. We acquire water resources and land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of inventory and expansion within our current markets. The valuation of real estate and water assets is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each asset. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws, political conditions, the condition of financial markets, local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject valuations to uncertainties. In addition, our valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If population growth and, as a result, water and/or housing demand in our markets fails to meet our expectations when we acquired our real estate and water assets, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our real estate and water assets. We regularly review the value of our real estate and water assets. These reviews have resulted in significant impairments to our water resource assets and /or land development assets. Such impairments have adversely affected our results of operations and our financial condition in those years.\nIf future market conditions adversely impact the anticipated timing of and amount of sales of our real estate and water assets we may be required to record further significant impairments to the carrying value of our real estate and water assets which would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur water resource and water storage operations are concentrated in a limited number of assets, making our growth and profitability vulnerable to conditions and fluctuations in a limited number of local economies.\nIn the future, we anticipate that a significant amount of our water resource and water storage segment revenue, results of operations and cash flows will come from a limited number of assets, which primarily consist of our water resources in Nevada and Arizona and our water storage operations in Arizona. Water resources in this region are scarce and we may not be successful in continuing to acquire and develop additional water assets. If we are unable to develop additional water assets, our revenues will be derived from a limited number of assets, primarily located in Arizona and Nevada. Our two most significant assets are our water storage operations in Arizona and our water resources to serve the northern valleys of Reno, Nevada. As a result of this concentration, our invested capital and results of operations will be vulnerable to the conditions and fluctuations in these local economies and potentially to changes in local government regulations.\nOur Arizona Recharge Facility is one of the few private sector water storage sites in Arizona. We have approximately 251,000 acre-feet of water stored at the facility. In addition, we have approximately 157,000 acre-feet of water stored in the Phoenix Active Management Area. We have not stored any water on behalf of any customers and have not generated any material revenue from the recharge facility or from the water stored in the Phoenix Active Management Area. We believe that the best economic return on the assets arises from storing water when surplus water is available and selling this water in periods when water is in more limited supply. However, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately be able to sell the stored water at a price sufficient to provide an adequate economic profit, if at all.\nWe constructed a pipeline approximately 35 miles long to deliver water from Fish Springs Ranch to the northern valleys of Reno, Nevada. As of December 31, 2014, the total cost of the pipeline project, including our water credits, (net of impairment losses incurred to date) carried on our balance sheet is approximately $83.9 million. To date, we have sold only a small amount of the water credits and we cannot provide any assurance that the sales prices we may obtain in the future will provide an adequate economic return, if at all. Furthermore, we believe the principal buyers of this water are likely real estate developers who are contending with the effects of the current weak demand that exists for new homes and residential development in this area. Any prolonged weak demand for new homes and residential development, and, as a result, for our assets in Nevada and Arizona, would have a material adverse effect on our future revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of our canola seed crushing facility may not generate sufficient cash flow to repay the debt that is secured on the facility.\nOur canola crushing operations has a limited operating history as of December 31, 2014 and to date has not generated annual operating income or positive cash flows. As a result, the facility may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may continue to operate at a loss. In certain situations, if the facility performs below certain operating levels leading to inadequate or negative cash flows, certain covenants in the agreements governing the facility\u2019s debt financing may be breached, rendering all of the facility\u2019s debt immediately due and payable. As a result, we may be forced to provide additional capital to our canola seed crushing operation to cure any breach of certain debt covenants which could lead to a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. As of December 31, 2014 we have invested a further $40.4 million to fund the operating losses to date of our canola seed crushing facility and to ensure certain debt covenants were not breached. If we are unable to cure any breach of certain debt covenants, or receive a waiver of default from our debt providers, our canola seed crushing plant may be foreclosed on by our debt providers and we may lose our entire investment in this operation which would lead to a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to procure sufficient quantities of canola seed to efficiently operate our proposed canola seed crushing facility due to adverse weather conditions and/or logistical constraints.\nThe supply and price of canola seed may be subject to extreme volatility due to adverse weather conditions and/or logistical constraints. If the supply of canola seed becomes limited due to significantly reduced harvests or transportation is unavailable to bring canola seed to our plant at desired times and acceptable prices, we may not be able to procure sufficient quantities of canola seed to achieve optimal crushing capacity at our facility. Significantly reduced crushing operations from our current capacity of approximately 1,400 tons per day would lead to significantly reduced revenue, and may result in further losses and negative cash flows from operations and may cause us to breach our debt covenants and default on our debt financing. As a result, our canola seed crushing plant may be foreclosed on by our debt providers and we may lose our entire investment in this operation which would lead to a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully penetrate the canola oil and meal markets.\nThe canola processing business is highly competitive and other companies presently in the market, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we have, or companies that could enter the market, could adversely affect profit margins for the products we sell. In addition, prices for canola seed, canola oil and canola meal are often volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control such as global inventory levels, farmer planting decisions, weather and canola crop conditions, demand for and supply of competing products for canola oil and meal and demand for biofuels. While we have agreements in place with an end user of both canola oil and meal for 100% of the products we produce from our facility, we compete with other canola seed processors who may be capable of producing significantly greater quantities of canola products than us, and who may achieve higher operating efficiencies and lower costs due to their scale as well as have greater financial resources than we have to endure any prolonged adverse conditions.\nWe may fail to implement an effective risk management program at our canola seed crushing facility.\nOur canola seed crushing facility is exposed to many commodity and financial risks including canola seed, canola oil and canola meal prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and transportation and energy costs. To attempt to manage certain of these risks, we have implemented, and intend to continue entering into, various hedging transactions with respect to future canola crush margins and the interest rate on the debt financing used to construct the facility. However, our hedging transactions may not fully minimize our exposure to these risks and we may not always be fully hedged.\nIn addition, a major component of our risk management program is the maintenance of a comprehensive insurance program. Our business interruption insurance or other insurance policies may not cover all losses arising from natural disasters or other events that would impair or terminate our ability to process canola seed into revenue generating products.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nDue to climate change, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for the canola seed we use to produce canola oil and meal. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery.\nIn particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, result in liabilities, limit the areas in which we can build homes and delay completion of our projects.\nOur real estate operations are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants and human health and safety. The particular environmental requirements which apply to any given project site vary according to multiple factors, including the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions, the current and former uses of the site, the presence or absence of state- or federal-listed endangered or threatened plants or animals or sensitive habitats, and conditions at nearby properties. We may not identify all of these concerns during any pre-acquisition or pre-development review of project sites. Environmental requirements and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or in areas contaminated by others before we commence development. We are also subject to third-party challenges, such as by environmental groups or neighborhood associations, under environmental laws and regulations governing the permits and other approvals for our real estate projects and operations. Sometimes regulators from different governmental agencies do not concur on development, remedial standards or property use restrictions for a project, and the resulting delays or additional costs can be material for a given project.\nIn addition, in cases where a state-listed or federally-listed endangered or threatened species is involved and related agency rule-making and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rule-making and litigation can be unpredictable and can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on, or the prohibition of, development and building activity in identified environmentally sensitive areas.\nWe are a recent entrant to the homebuilding business and we will face significant competition in marketing and selling new homes.\nWe have entered the homebuilding business by constructing, marketing and selling single-family homes on certain of our finished residential lots that we own in California, Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. We aim to build homes only in those markets where we have identified that a sufficient demand exists for new homes. However, the homebuilding industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with a number of national and local homebuilders in selling homes to satisfy expected demand. These competitors, especially the national homebuilders, have greater resources and experience in this industry than we have. Such competition could result in lower than anticipated sales volumes and/or profit margins that are below our expectations. In addition, we will have to compete with the resale of existing homes, including foreclosed homes, which could also negatively affect the number and price of homes we are able to sell and the time our homes remain on the market.\nWe use leverage to finance a portion of the cost to acquire our land development assets and to construct homes.\nWe currently use, and expect to continue to use, debt to finance a portion of the cost of constructing our homes and acquiring and developing our lots. Such indebtedness is primarily comprised of project-level secured acquisition, development and construction loans, with recourse limited to the securing collateral.\nIncurring debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nour cash flow from our land development and homebuilding operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt which is likely to result in acceleration of the maturity of such debt;\n\u2022\nour debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment yields will increase with higher financing cost;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from our land development and homebuilding operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for the operations and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the debt being refinanced.\nIf we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity, it may be necessary to refinance the debt through additional debt or additional equity financings which could dilute our interest in our land development and homebuilding business. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancing, increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our land development and housing assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. To the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we will risk losing some or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Defaults under our debt agreements used to finance a portion of the cost of constructing homes and acquiring and developing lots could have a material adverse effect on our land development and homebuilding business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to significant warranty, construction defect and liability claims in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business.\nAs a homebuilder, we may be subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We may also be subject to liability claims for injuries that occur in the course of construction activities. Due to the inherent uncertainties in such claims, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage or our subcontractors\u2019 insurance and financial resources will be sufficient to meet any warranty, construction defect and liability claims we may receive in the future. If we are subject to claims beyond our insurance coverage, our profit from our homebuilding activities may be less than we expect and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe will be relying on the performance of our subcontractors to build horizontal infrastructure and homes according to our budget, timetable and quality.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of horizontal infrastructure (in the cases where we are completing the development of entitled lots to finished lots) and of the homes we are building on certain of our finished lots. In certain cases, we will also rely on the subcontractor to select and obtain raw materials. Our subcontractors may fail to meet either our quality control or be unable to build and complete the horizontal infrastructure or homes in the expected timetable due to subcontractor related issues such as being unable to obtain sufficient materials or skilled labor, or due to external factors such as delays arising from severe weather conditions.\nAny such failure by our subcontractors could lead to increases in construction costs and construction delays. Such increases could negatively impact the price and number of finished lots and homes we are able to sell.\nCompliance with federal, state and local regulations related to our real estate operations may result in substantial delays and costs.\nOur real estate operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that affect the land development and homebuilding process, including laws and regulations related to zoning, permitted land uses, levels of density, building design, water and waste disposal and use of open spaces. We also are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment. We are typically required to obtain permits, entitlements and approvals from local authorities to start and carry out residential development or home construction. Such permits, entitlements and approvals may, from time-to-time, be opposed or challenged by local governments or other interested parties, adding delays, costs and risks of non-approval to the process. Our obligation to comply with the laws and regulations under which we operate, and our need to ensure that our subcontractors and other agents comply with these laws and regulations may result in delays in construction and land development and may also cause us to incur substantial additional and unbudgeted costs.\nOur homebuilding operations may be adversely impacted by the availability of and the demand for mortgage financing and any changes to the tax benefits associated with owning a home.\nTo successfully market and sell the homes we construct depends on the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing for the purchase of these new homes. Current credit requirements for mortgage financing are significantly greater than in the past which makes it more difficult for a potential home buyer to obtain mortgage financing. In addition, any significant increase in interest rates from current rates may also lead to increased mortgage finance costs leading to a decline in demand and availability of mortgage financing. Any decline in the availability of mortgage financing may lead to a reduced demand for the homes we have already constructed, or intend to construct. Furthermore, the demand for homes in general, and the homes we intend to construct, may be affected by changes in federal and state income tax laws. Current federal, and many state, tax laws allow the deduction of, among other homeowner expenses, mortgage interest and property taxes against an individual\u2019s taxable income. Any changes to the current tax laws which reduce or eliminate these deductions, or reduce or eliminate the exclusion of taxable gain from the sale of a principal residence, would likely lead to a greatly reduced demand for homes. This would lead to a materially adverse impact on the homebuilding business in general and our revenues, cash flows and financial condition specifically.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to any of our assets at one or more of our different businesses and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies or otherwise be subject to significant deductibles or limits. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected asset(s) as well as anticipated future income from that asset. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles.\nWe may not receive all of the permitted water rights we expect from the water rights applications we have filed in Nevada and New Mexico.\nWe have filed certain water rights applications in Nevada and New Mexico. In Nevada this is primarily as part of the water teaming agreement with Lincoln County. We deploy the capital required to enable the filed applications to be converted into permitted water rights over time as and when we deem appropriate or as otherwise required. We only expend capital in those areas where our initial investigations lead us to believe that we can obtain a sufficient volume of water to provide an adequate economic return on the capital employed in the project. These capital expenditures largely consist of drilling and engineering costs for water production, costs of monitoring wells, legal and consulting costs for hearings with the State Engineer, and NEPA compliance costs. Until the State Engineer in the relevant state permits the water rights we are applying for, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be awarded all of the water that we expect based on the results of our drilling and our legal position and it may be a considerable period of time before we are able to ascertain the final volume of water rights, if any, that will be permitted by the State Engineers. Any significant reduction in the volume of water awarded to us from our original base expectation of the amount of water that may be permitted may result in the write down of capitalized costs which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows.\nVariances in physical availability of water, along with environmental and legal restrictions and legal impediments, could impact profitability.\nWe value our water assets, in part, based upon the volume (as measured in acre-feet) of water we anticipate from water rights applications and our permitted water rights. The water and water rights held by us and the transferability of these rights to other uses, persons, and places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico. The volumes of water actually derived from the water rights applications or permitted rights may vary considerably based upon physical availability and may be further limited by applicable legal restrictions.\nAs a result, the volume of water anticipated from the water rights applications or permitted rights may not in every case represent a reliable, firm annual yield of water, but in some cases describe the face amount of the water right claims or management\u2019s best estimate of such entitlement. Additionally, we may face legal restrictions on the sale or transfer of some of our water assets, which may affect their commercial value. If the volume of water yielded from our water rights applications is less than our expectations, or we are unable to transfer or sell our water assets, we may lose some or all of our anticipated returns, which may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nPurchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their obligations to us and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nIn certain circumstances, we finance sales of real estate and water assets, and we secure such financing through deeds of trust on the property, which are only released once the financing has been fully paid off. Purchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their financing obligations. Such defaults may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sale of water assets may be subject to environmental regulations which would impact our revenues, profitability, and cash flows.\nThe quality of the water assets we lease or sell may be subject to regulation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency acting pursuant to the United States Safe Drinking Water Act. While environmental regulations do not directly affect us, the regulations regarding the quality of water distributed affects our intended customers and may, therefore, depending on the quality of our water, impact the price and terms upon which we may in the future sell our water assets. If we need to reduce the price of our water assets in order to make a sale to our intended customers, our balance sheet, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nOur water asset sales may meet with political opposition in certain locations, thereby limiting our growth in these areas.\nThe water assets we hold and the transferability of these assets and rights to other uses, persons, or places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. Our sale of water assets is subject to the risks of delay associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits. Additionally, the transfer of water resources from one use to another may affect the economic base or impact other issues of a community including development, and will, in some instances, be met with local opposition. Moreover, municipalities who will likely regulate the use of any water we might sell to them in order to manage growth, could create additional requirements that we must satisfy to sell and convey water assets.\nIf we are unable to effectively transfer, sell and convey water resources, our ability to monetize these assets will suffer and our revenues and financial condition would decline.\nIf we do not successfully identify, select and manage acquisitions and investments, or if our acquisitions or investments otherwise fail or decline in value, our financial condition could suffer.\nWe acquire and invest in businesses and assets that we believe are undervalued or that will benefit from additional capital, restructuring of operations, strategic initiatives, or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies. If an acquired business, investment or asset fails or its fair value declines, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may not be able to find sufficient opportunities to make our business strategy successful. If we fail to successfully identify, select and manage acquisition and investment opportunities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. Such business failures, declines in fair values, and/or failure to successfully identify, select and manage acquisitions or investments, could result in a negative return on equity. We could also lose part or all of our capital in these businesses and experience reductions in our net income, cash flows, assets and equity.\nFuture acquisitions and dispositions of our businesses, assets, operations and investments are possible, and, if unsuccessful, could reduce the value of our common shares. Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.\nFailure to successfully manage newly acquired companies could adversely affect our business.\nOur management of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of personnel, information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, taxation, regulatory matters, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and could distract our management from the day-to-day operations of our business. The diversion of our management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations, or difficulties encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to integrate acquired businesses, personnel, resources, or assets into our operations successfully, we may be unable to achieve our strategic goals or an economic return and the value of your investment could suffer.\nWe operate in a variety of industries and market sectors, all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and would be adversely affected by a recession. We also look for opportunities in industries and market sectors in which we do not have any operating history. For example, in 2010, we completed a business combination for a canola seed crushing operation, an agribusiness in which we had no previous operating experience. A worsening of general economic or market conditions may require us to devote more of our management resources to newly acquired companies and may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets.\nOur acquisitions may result in dilution to our shareholders and increase our exposure to additional liabilities.\nWe make selective acquisitions of companies that we believe could benefit from our resources of additional capital, business expertise, management direction and oversight, or existing operations. We endeavor to enhance and realize additional value to these acquired companies through our influence and control. Any acquisition could result in the use of a significant portion of our available cash, significant dilution caused by the issuance of securities to pay for any acquisition, and significant acquisition-related charges. Acquisitions may also result in the assumption of liabilities, including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known to us at the time of the acquisition, which could have a material adverse financial effect on us. Moreover, we may need to incur debt obligations, in order to finance new acquisitions. Additionally, our acquisitions and investments may yield low or negative returns for an extended period of time, which could temporarily or permanently depress our return on shareholders\u2019 equity, and we may not realize the value of the funds invested.\nWe generally make acquisitions and investments that tend to be long term in nature, and for the purpose of realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of influence and control. We acquire businesses that we believe to be undervalued or may benefit from additional capital, restructuring of operations or management or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies with our existing operations or through appropriate and strategic management input. We may not be able to develop acceptable revenue streams and investment returns through the businesses we acquire, and as a result we may lose part or all of our investment in these assets.\nAdditionally, when any of our acquisitions do not achieve acceptable rates of return or we do not realize the value of the funds invested, we may write down the value of such acquisitions or sell the acquired businesses at a loss. Some of our prior acquisitions have lost either part or all of the capital we invested. Unsuccessful acquisitions could have negative impacts on our cash flows, income, assets and shareholders\u2019 equity, which may be temporary or permanent. Moreover, the process we employ to enhance value in our acquisitions and investments can consume considerable amounts of time and resources. Consequently, costs incurred as a result of these acquisitions and investments may exceed their revenues and/or increases in their values, if any, for an extended period of time.\nOur ability to achieve an acceptable rate of return on any particular investment is subject to a number of factors which may be beyond our control, including increased competition and loss of market share, the ability of management to implement their strategic and operational directives, cyclical or uneven financial results, technological obsolescence, foreign currency risks and regulatory delays.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our business and acquisitions, and financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\nWe currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long-term growth of our business and acquisitions. We may raise additional funds through public or private debt, equity or hybrid securities financings, including, without limitation, through the issuance of securities. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement which allows us to sell up to $400 million of a variety of securities in one or more offerings in the public markets.\nWe may experience difficulty in raising necessary capital in view of the recent volatility in the capital markets and increases in the cost of finance. Increasingly stringent rating standards could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. Indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. The additional financing we may need may not be available to us, or on favorable terms. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our strategic plan would be significantly limited. In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if our company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in our equity ownership over a three year period), the ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $133.7 million and $176.1 million, respectively, which, depending on our value at the time of any ownership changes, could be limited.\nOur acquisitions of and investments in non-U.S. companies subject us to additional market, liquidity, tax and foreign exchange risks which could affect the value of our stock.\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, businesses and securities in non-U.S. public companies and other assets or businesses not located in the U.S. Typically, these non-U.S. securities are not registered with the SEC and regulation of these companies is under the jurisdiction of the relevant non-U.S country. The respective non-U.S. regulatory regime may limit our ability to obtain timely and comprehensive financial information for the non-U.S. companies in which we have invested. In addition, if a non-U.S. company in which we invest were to take actions which could be deleterious to its shareholders, non-U.S. legal systems may make it difficult or time-consuming for us to challenge such actions. These factors may affect our ability to acquire controlling stakes, or to dispose of our non-U.S. investments, or to realize the full fair value of our non-U.S. investments. In addition, investments in non-U.S. countries may give rise to complex cross-border tax issues. We aim to manage our tax affairs efficiently, but given the complexity of dealing with U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, we may have to pay tax in both the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries, and we may be unable to offset any U.S. tax liabilities with non-U.S. tax credits. If we are unable to manage our non-U.S. tax issues efficiently, our financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, our base currency is United States dollars. Accordingly, we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our acquisitions of stocks in non-U.S. public companies.\nSignificant fluctuations in the non-U.S. currencies in which we hold investments or consummate transactions could negatively impact our financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows. We also may be unable to effectively and efficiently repatriate funds into the U.S. upon monetization of assets, securities, or businesses not located in the U.S., which could have an impact on our liquidity.\nWe may not be able to retain key management personnel we need to succeed, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our businesses.\nTo run our day-to-day operations and to successfully manage newly acquired companies we must, among other things, continue to attract and retain key management. We rely on the services of a small team of key executive officers. If they depart, it could have a significant adverse effect upon our business. Mr. Hart, our CEO, is key to the implementation of our strategic focus, and our ability to successfully develop our current strategy is dependent upon our ability to retain his services. Also, increased competition for skilled management and staff employees in our businesses could cause us to experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability.\nBecause our operations are diverse, analysts and investors may not be able to evaluate us adequately, which may negatively influence the price of our stock.\nWe are a diversified holding company with significant operations in a variety of business segments. Each of these areas is unique, complex in nature, and difficult to understand. In particular, the water resource business is a developing industry in the United States with very little historical and comparable data, very complex valuation issues and a limited following of analysts. Because we are complex, analysts and investors may not be able to adequately evaluate our operations and enterprise as a going concern. This could cause analysts and investors to make inaccurate evaluations of our stock, or to overlook PICO in general. As a result, the trading volume and price of our stock could suffer and may be subject to excessive volatility.\nFluctuations in the market price of our common stock may affect your ability to sell your shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may be significantly impacted by:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in financial performance and condition of our various businesses;\n\u2022\nshortfalls in revenue or earnings from estimates forecast by securities analysts or others;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates by such analysts;\n\u2022\nthe availability of economically viable acquisition or investment opportunities, including water resources and real estate, which will return an adequate economic return;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlitigation; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other matters described herein.\nOur results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and our future results of operations could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Causes of such fluctuations may include the inclusion or exclusion of operating earnings from newly acquired or sold operations, one time transactions, and impairment losses. Statements or changes in opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares. In addition, some investors favor companies that pay dividends, particularly in market downturns. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, shareholders or customers could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Additionally, from time to time we or our subsidiaries will have disputes with companies or individuals which may result in litigation that could necessitate our management\u2019s attention and require us to expend our resources. We may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure to specific litigation and we cannot provide any assurance that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to us. We may be forced to resolve litigation in a manner not favorable to us, and such resolution could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur governing documents could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California General Corporation Law could discourage a third party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, control of our company without approval of our board of directors. For example, our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law, which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed \u201cinterested party\u201d reorganization transaction. All or any of these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nIf equity analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use our data centers and our networks to store and access our proprietary business information. We face various cyber security threats, including cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our proprietary or sensitive information. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The result of these incidents could include disrupted operations, lost opportunities, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation and reputational damage. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nTHE FOREGOING FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MAKE COMPARISON OF HISTORIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AND BALANCES, DIFFICULT OR NOT MEANINGFUL.", "PERMNO": 76586, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "PICO"}
