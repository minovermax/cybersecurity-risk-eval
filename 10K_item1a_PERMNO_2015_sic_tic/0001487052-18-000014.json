Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose some or all of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nIf economic conditions deteriorate in the state of Texas, the value of our collateral and borrowers' ability to repay loans may decline.\nSubstantially all of our loans are located in the state of Texas. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest rates which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, declines in oil and gas prices, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events. Decreases in real estate values in the state of Texas could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for some of our loans. As a result, the market value of the real estate underlying the loans may not, at any given time, be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans. In the event that we are required to foreclose on a property securing a loan, we may not recover funds in an amount equal to the remaining loan balance. Consequently, we would sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher provision for credit losses, which would have an adverse impact on earnings. In addition, if oil prices were to experience a sustained decline, jobs related to the exploration, production and delivery of oil and gas may decline. Adverse changes in the Texas economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would also have an adverse impact on earnings.\nOur loan portfolio, and specifically our energy lending portfolio, could be impacted by declines in the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as other factors.\nReserve-based energy loans, which are reported as commercial and industrial loans, totaled $531.7 million at December 31, 2017, representing approximately 8.0% of total loans (excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans). As a result, the factors that impact the energy sector will have a greater effect on us than on more broadly diversified financial institutions. Companies with exposure to the energy sector, whether directly or indirectly, are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of oil and gas, and can be impacted by governmental regulations, international politics and conflicts, including the lifting or imposition of sanctions on Iran, Russia or other oil producing countries, hostilities in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, the success of exploration projects, reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation, natural disasters, clean-up and litigation costs associated with environmental damage and extensive regulation.\nAlthough the vast majority of the loans in the Energy portfolio are reserve based loans, secured by deeds of trust on properties containing both oil and natural gas reserves, approximately $15.4 million of the loans managed by the Energy Finance group are not secured by oil and gas reserves and are categorized as \u201cMidstream and Other\u201d loans. Loans in this category are typically related to the transmission of oil and natural gas and would only be indirectly impacted from declining commodity prices. Reserve based loans are typically less sensitive to declines in commodity prices than loans to companies that service the oil and gas industry, because once production is initiated in a well, it is generally not halted until reserves are gone, whereas companies that service the energy industry typically feel an immediate impact to large drops in oil prices since drilling and exploration is slowed immediately. With reserve based loans, the value of our collateral decreases as oil and natural gas prices decline.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company increased qualitative reserve factors applied to the energy loan portfolio due to the impact of pressure on the price of oil, and the Company has continued to apply elevated reserve amounts to the energy portfolio through 2016 and 2017 due to sustained economic and regulatory uncertainty surrounding energy loans. The allowance for loan losses allocated to energy loans at December 31, 2017 totaled $20.7 million, up $1.5 million from $19.2 million at December 31, 2016. During 2017, in an effort to reduce world supply and increase oil and gas prices, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 (\"OPEC\") and several other oil producing nations agreed to limit oil production and have indicated an intention to continue these efforts in 2018; however, there are no assurances that setting these types of production caps will support higher prices for oil and gas or that actual production will be limited. Previous agreements have been broken by nations and there is no firm mechanism for enforcement. In addition, those efforts by OPEC and other oil producing nations to reduce demand have been blunted by a massive boom in production by U.S. shale operators, who have become much more efficient. Sustained low oil and gas prices, or further declines in oil and gas pricing, could lead to additional risk rating downgrades, loan loss reserves, or losses.\nFurther, the economy in Texas as a whole could be negatively impacted if there are a high number of jobs lost related to a decline in oil production in the state, or if the impact of lower oil prices negatively affect other industries. Major regulatory shifts, such as those that may result as a consequence of environmental regulations, that create significant expense to oil and gas processing or recovery, could be one reason for a decline in oil production in Texas. In addition, subsidies created to fund alternative energy could make these other forms of energy more competitively priced and thus decrease the demand for oil and gas. A decline in the Texas economy related to oil production decline could impact our loan portfolios outside of the energy portfolio, if borrowers experience unemployment or loss of income and are unable to make payments on their loans.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our percentage of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.\nOver the last several years, through organic growth and acquisitions, we have been re-balancing our loan portfolio by increasing our commercial lending to diversify our loan mix and improve the yield on our assets, and we anticipate that trend to continue. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to our previous target asset of one- to four- family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers' business and the real estate securing the loans as collateral, both of which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Additionally, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of our operation.\nSeveral of our borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer than for one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Since we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses due to the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings. Any delinquent payments or the failure to repay these loans would hurt our earnings.\nOur Warehouse Purchase Program balances can fluctuate widely.\nBecause Warehouse Purchase Program balances are contingent upon residential mortgage lending activity, changes in the residential real estate market nationwide can lead to wide fluctuations of balances in this product, materially impacting both interest and non-interest income. Additionally, Warehouse Purchase Program period-end balances are generally higher than the average balance during the period due to increased mortgage activity that occurs at the end of a month, which can significantly impact the Company's reported capital ratios.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs with most financial institutions, our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Interest rates, which remain largely at historically low levels, are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control such as general economic conditions and policies of the federal government, in particular the Federal Open Market Committee. In an attempt to help the overall\neconomy, the FRB has kept interest rates low through its targeted Fed Funds rate. During 2017, the FRB increased the Fed Funds rate three times, each time by 25 basis points, and has indicated that further increases are likely during 2018, subject to economic conditions. As the FRB increases the Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the U.S. economic recovery. Further, changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence (i) the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, (ii) the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, (iii) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (iv) the fair value of our assets and liabilities, and (v) the reinvestment risk associated with a reduced duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. When interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented an effective asset and liability management strategy to manage the potential effects of changes in interest rates, including the use of adjustable rate and/or short-term assets, and FHLB advances or longer term repurchase agreements, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation and/or our strategies may not always be successful in managing the risk associated with changes in interest rates.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations or deterioration in credit markets.\nAt December 31, 2017, public funds totaled $972.2 million, representing 14.37% of our total deposits. Public funds are bank deposits of state and local municipalities. These deposits are required to be secured by certain investment grade securities (including letters of credit from the FHLB) to ensure repayment, which on the one hand tends to reduce our contingent liquidity risk by making these funds somewhat less credit sensitive, but on the other hand reduces standby liquidity by restricting the potential liquidity of the pledged collateral. Although these funds historically have been a relatively stable source of funds for us, availability depends on the individual municipality's fiscal policies and cash flow needs.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate that our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or losses, both internally and through acquisitions. Any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time (which are outside our control) and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or if the terms will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain key employees may change.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key employees, competition for which can be intense. We may not be able to hire or retain these employees. The unexpected loss of a key employee could have a material adverse impact on our business as the skills, knowledge of our market and institution, and the years of experience of a departing key employee which are all difficult to quickly replace with qualified personnel.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Bank's customer relationships. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated.\nThere have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyberattacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.\nIn addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions may be affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our systems or the systems of our third-party vendors, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could require us to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and/or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability.\nNatural disasters, severe weather events, worldwide hostilities, including terrorist attacks, and other external events may adversely affect the general economy, the financial services industry, the industries of our customers, and us in particular.\nNatural disasters, severe weather events, including those prominent in our geographic footprint and those prominent in the geographic areas of our vendors and business partners, together with worldwide hostilities, including terrorist attacks, and other external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our business. They could also affect the stability of our deposit base, our borrowers' ability to repay loans, impair collateral, result in a loss of revenue or an increase in expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery and business continuity procedures and plans, the occurrence of any such event may adversely affect our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FRB and the TDOB and as a bank holding company the Company is subject to examination, supervision and regulation by the FRB. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution's operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination\nand enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions such as the Bank with $10 billion or less in assets are examined for compliance with the federal consumer laws by their primary federal bank regulators but are subject to the rules of the CFPB.\nThe CFPB has issued a number of final regulations and changes to certain consumer protections under existing laws. These final rules generally prohibit creditors from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumer\u2019s ability-to-repay and add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules limit prepayment penalties and require the creditor to retain evidence of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirement for three years. Compliance with these rules has increased, and will likely continue to increase, our overall regulatory compliance costs and may require changes to our underwriting practices with respect to mortgage loans. Moreover, these rules may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we underwrite and may subject us to increased potential liabilities related to such residential loan origination activities.\nIt is difficult to predict at this time all the specific impacts the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of its rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, they have increased and are expected to continue to increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect key operating efficiency ratios, and could increase our non-interest expense. See - \u201cBusiness - How We Are Regulated\u201d contained in Part I, Item I of this report.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income and may decrease our efficiency.\nWe, directly and indirectly through the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the TDOB, the FRB and the FDIC, and other regulatory bodies. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank's operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses and its risk weighting of its assets and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Our business is highly regulated; therefore, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a material impact on our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy or interpretation, affecting lending and funding practices, interest rate risk management and liquidity standards. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. Bank regulatory agencies, such as the TDOB and the FRB, regulate the activities in which we may engage primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors. In addition, new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. In recent years, a number of banking institutions have been required to pay large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us or the financial services industry in general.\nWe, and other participants in the financial services industry upon whom we rely to operate, have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Most of the proceedings we consider to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry, however it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that anyone in particular, including us, will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion incurred in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adversely effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We believe we have controls in place to detect and prevent such losses but in some cases multi-party collusion or other sophisticated methods of hiding fraud, may not be readily detected or detectable, and could result in losses that affect our financial condition and results of our operations.\nFinancial crime is not limited to the financial services industry. Our customers could experience fraud in their businesses, which could materially impact their ability to repay their loans, and deposit customers in all financial institutions are constantly and unwittingly solicited by others in fraud schemes that vary from easily detectable and obvious attempts to high-level and very complex international schemes that could drain an account of millions of dollars and require detailed financial forensics to unravel. While we have controls in place, contractual agreements with our customers partitioning liability, and insurance to help mitigate the risk, none of these are guarantees that we will not experience a loss, potentially a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of our operations.\nOur business is reliant on outside vendors.\nOur business is highly dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for our day-to-day operations, including such high level vendors as our data processing vendor, our card processing vendor and our on-line banking vendors. Our operations are exposed to risk that a vendor may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in our agreements for any number of reasons including a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of vendor management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of our operations.\nNew or changing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit our stockholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a material impact on our operations, increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and/or otherwise adversely affect us and our profitability. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent registered public accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes. We cannot predict what restrictions may be imposed upon us with future legislation.\nOur business initiatives and strategies, product lines, revenue enhancement or efficiency improvements may be less successful than anticipated or not realized at all.\nWe make certain projections and assumptions when we adopt or modify existing business initiatives and strategies, product lines, enter or expand our market presence, attempt to re-balance our loan portfolio, execute our customer retention plan or seek revenue enhancement or efficiency improvements. Our projections and assumptions may not be accurate and may be affected by numerous conditions outside of our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve desired or projected results on the timeline we anticipate, some benefits may not be fully realized or we may not realize any benefit at all.\nOur customers may have difficulty weathering a downturn in the economy, which may impair their ability to repay their loans.\nHistorically we have, and will continue to, target our marketing and business development strategies primarily to local or regional, small-to-medium sized businesses, some of whom are in volatile industries such as energy and real estate. These firms are generally more vulnerable to economic downturns, whether large and sudden downturns or moderate downturns that are more prolonged, and may not have the capital needed to compete against their larger, more capitalized competitors or a particular business sector may be affected significantly more than other sectors or the economy as a whole, and these firms may therefore experience volatile operating results, which may affect their ability to repay their loans. Additionally, the continued success of these firms is frequently contingent on a small group of owners or senior management, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of such individuals could also have a material adverse effect on the business and its ability to repay its loan obligations. Economic downturns and other events that affect the economy as a whole, or our customers business in particular, could cause us to incur credit losses that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation.\nThe credit quality of our loans could decline.\nAlthough we regularly review credit exposure related to particular customers, industry sectors and product lines, default risk may arise from circumstances that are difficult to predict or detect. In such circumstances, we could experience an increase in our provision for credit losses, reserve for credit loss, nonperforming assets, and net charge-offs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation.\nOur loan portfolio also contains adjustable rate loans. Borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan from the initial fixed to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin. Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate loans, increasing the possibility of default. Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably lower interest rates. In addition, a decline in housing prices may leave borrowers with insufficient equity in the collateral to permit them to refinance or the inability to sell the collateral for an amount equal to or greater than the unpaid principal balance of their loans.\nThese potential negative events, which may have a greater impact on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of other financial institutions due to our product mix, may cause us to incur losses, which would adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial condition and business operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and/or our non-performing assets may increase.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, evaluate economic conditions and make various assumptions and judgments about the loan portfolio. Management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, such as the increased focus on commercial and industrial loans, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios not performing in a historical or projected manner. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additions to our allowance, which decreases our net income.\nOur banking regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These entities may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2020. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of\nlifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. It may also result in even small changes to future forecasts having a significant impact on the allowance, which could make the allowance more volatile, and regulators may impose additional capital buffers to absorb this volatility. Our level of non-performing and other classified assets adversely affect our net income in various ways, including interest accruals, reserves for credit losses, write-downs and additional costs, including carrying costs of other real estate owned assets.\nIn addition, we may find it necessary or desirable to foreclose on certain loans we originate or acquire, and the foreclosure process may be lengthy and expensive. While we believe we have made all proper filings to properly secure our loans, to the extent we have not properly perfected our lien or ownership interest in the collateral securing our loans, our anticipated priority and perfection of the applicable security interest may be jeopardized. Furthermore, claims may be asserted by other lenders, borrowers or other claimants that might interfere with enforcement of our rights. Borrowers may resist foreclosure actions by asserting numerous claims, counterclaims and defenses against us, including, without limitation, lender liability claims and defenses, even when the assertions may have no basis in fact, in an effort to prolong the foreclosure action and seek to force us into a modification of the loan or a favorable buy-out of the borrower\u2019s position in the loan. Foreclosure actions can take several years or more to litigate. At any time prior to or during the foreclosure proceedings, the borrower may file for bankruptcy, which would have the effect of staying the foreclosure actions and further delaying the foreclosure process and potentially result in a reduction or discharge of a borrower\u2019s debt. Foreclosure also may create a negative public perception of the related property, resulting in a diminution of its value. Even if we are successful in foreclosing on a loan, the liquidation proceeds upon sale of the underlying real estate may not be sufficient to recover our cost basis in the loan, resulting in a loss to us. Furthermore, any costs or delays involved in the foreclosure of the loan or a liquidation of the underlying property will further reduce the net proceeds and, thus, increase the loss.\nFurther, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from the overall supervision of our operations and other income-producing activities, all of which can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management program may not be able to adequately monitor or control perceived risks.\nOur enterprise risk management (\u201cERM\u201d) program, which is designed to formalize the practice of understanding and controlling the nature and amount of risk we take pursuing our business initiatives and strategies and to establish management accountability for the risks accepted, includes an institution-wide coordination of credit risk, operational risk, market risk, capital management and liquidity management.\nIn 2012, the FRB issued proposed rules (\u201cEnhanced Prudential Standards\u201d) for the management of enterprise wide risk applicable to complex or larger financial institutions over $10 billion in assets or are otherwise covered by the Dodd-Frank Act. Some of the requirements of the Enhanced Prudential Standards include a formal board-level risk committee and the establishment of a Chief Risk Officer with oversight of the ERM program. While the Enhanced Prudential Standards may not currently be a requirement for us, management believes that much of the Enhanced Prudential Standards represent industry best-practices and we have already implemented, or are in the process of implementing, many of its requirements.\nWhile we have an ERM program with Board-level involvement, we may not be able to monitor or control all risks, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe pursue a strategy of supplementing internal growth by acquiring other financial companies or their assets and liabilities that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we have partially expanded our business through acquisitions. We completed the Highlands acquisition in April 2012 and the acquisition of LegacyTexas Group, Inc. in January 2015. Although our business strategy emphasizes organic expansion, we continue, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, to engage in preliminary discussions with potential acquisition targets. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets. The consummation of any future acquisitions may dilute shareholder value or may have an adverse effect upon our operating results while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated into our operations. In addition, once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of profitability comparable to those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. Further, transaction-related expenses may adversely affect our earnings. These adverse effects on our earnings and results of operations may have a negative impact on the value of\nthe Company\u2019s stock. Acquiring banks, bank branches or other businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets, and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;\n\u2022\nPrices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future;\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u2022\nTo the extent our costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired, the acquisition will generate goodwill. As discussed below, we are required to assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually, and any goodwill impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; and\n\u2022\nTo finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available for sale securities, net of taxes. There can be no assurance that declines in the market value of our securities portfolio will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are subject to a decline, perhaps even significantly, for several reasons including if there is a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, change in the business environment, or a material and sustained decline in the market value of our stock, which may require us to take future charges related to the impairment of that goodwill and other intangible assets in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets.\nWe may be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny if and when the Company or the Bank\u2019s total assets exceed $10.0 billion.\nThe Company\u2019s and the Bank's total assets were $9.09 billion at December 31, 2017. If the Bank\u2019s total assets equal or exceed $10 billion, we will become subject to a number of additional requirements (such as annual stress testing requirements, an enterprise risk management committee comprised of independent directors, including one risk management expert, and general oversight by the CFPB) that will impose additional compliance costs on our business. The $10 billion threshold is calculated in different ways for the various requirements (from simply reaching the $10 billion as of a certain date, to reaching it for four consecutive quarters or to reaching it by averaging total consolidated assets for four consecutive quarters) and the dates the new requirements are triggered also vary (from immediate application to a period of over two years to achieve compliance). Being subject to these additional requirements may also result in higher expectations from regulators. The CFPB has near exclusive supervision authority, including examination authority, over institutions of that size and their affiliates to assess compliance with federal consumer financial laws, to obtain information about the institutions\u2019 activities and compliance systems and procedures, and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the Deposit Insurance Fund was increased from 1.15% to 1.35% and the FDIC is required, in setting deposit insurance assessments, to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, which results in institutions with assets greater than $10 billion paying a surcharge during a temporary period expected to last through 2018. In addition, if the Bank exceeds $10 billion in assets, its assessment base for federal deposit insurance will change from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less tangible capital to a scorecard method. The scorecard method uses a performance score and a loss severity score, which are combined and converted into an initial base assessment rate. The performance score is based on measures of the bank\u2019s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress and weighted CAMELS ratings, which are ratings ascribed under the CAMELS supervisory rating system and assigned based on a supervisory authority\u2019s analysis of a bank\u2019s financial statements and on-site examinations. The loss severity score is a measure of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the bank\u2019s failure. Under a formula, the performance score and loss severity score are combined and converted to a total score that determines the bank\u2019s initial base assessment rate. The FDIC has the discretion to alter the total score based on factors not captured by the scorecard. The resulting initial base assessment rate is also subject to adjustments downward based on long term unsecured debt issued by the bank, to adjustment upward based on long term unsecured debt held by the bank that is issued by other FDIC-insured institutions, and to further adjustment upward if the bank\u2019s brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits.\nFurther, we may be affected by the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act regarding limits on debit card interchange fees. The Durbin Amendment gave the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The FRB has adopted rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs.\nAs a result of the above, if and when our total assets exceed $10 billion, deposit insurance assessments, expenses related to regulatory compliance are likely to increase, and interchange fee income will decrease, the cumulative effect of which may be significant.\nRisks Related to the Company's Common Stock\nRegulatory and corporate governance anti-takeover provisions may make it difficult for you to receive a change-in-control premium.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock. With certain limited exceptions, federal regulations make it difficult for any one person or company or a group of persons from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the appropriate federal regulator(s). Certain provisions of our corporate documents are also designed to make merger, tender offer or proxy contest more difficult, even if such events were perceived by many of our stockholders to be beneficial to their interests.\nOur stock price can be volatile and its trading volume is generally less than other institutions.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report that are outside of our control and which may occur regardless of our operating results. Also, although our common stock is currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq, the trading volume of our stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. Given the lower trading volume of our stock, significant sales of the stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends on our stock.\nOur shareholders are only entitled to receive dividends declared by the Board out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate future dividends. This could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Also, we are a bank holding company, and our ability and the ability of our subsidiary bank to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines and regulations of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The ability of a subsidiary bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions depends on its earnings and capital levels and may be limited by its regulators' directives or orders. In our case, our banking subsidiary generally must obtain regulatory approval of a dividend if the total dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including any proposed dividend, exceeds its net income for the current year and retained net income for the prior two years. Our banking subsidiary's net income for the two years ended December 31, 2017 totaled $199.9 million and the amount paid to the Company during that two year period totaled $35.0 million. See \u201cHow We Are Regulated - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\u201d under Item 1 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nAn investment in the Company's common stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Company's common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Company's common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Company's common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 91514, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "LTXB"}
