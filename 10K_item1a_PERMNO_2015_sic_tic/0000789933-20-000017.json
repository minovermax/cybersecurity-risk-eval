RISK FACTORS\nTermination of or default under long-term mining contracts could materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nSubstantially all of the Coal Mining segment's profits are derived from long-term mining contracts. Although the Company has long-term contracts, numerous political and regulatory authorities, along with well-funded environmental activist groups, are devoting substantial resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. As a result of such activities, the Coal Mining segment's customers could prematurely retire certain coal-fired generating units. Any customers' premature plant closure could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Great River Energy, Falkirk's customer, announced that it was evaluating the economics of the Coal Creek Station (\"CCS\") power plant. The Company has a mining contract to supply coal to CCS that expires in 2045. Any decision by Great River Energy to reduce operations or prematurely close CCS would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Coal Mining segment derived approximately 60% of earnings of unconsolidated operations from two customers, Basin Electric Power Cooperative and Great River Energy. There are inherent risks whenever a significant percentage of total earnings are concentrated with a limited number of customers. Earnings from the Coal Mining segment's largest customers may fluctuate from time to time based on numerous factors, including market conditions and the realignment of customers' power generation portfolios that reduce the electric power generated from coal, which may be outside of the Company's control. If any of the Coal Mining segment's largest customers experience declining demand due to market, economic or competitive conditions, it could have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability, cash flows and financial position. In addition, if any customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nMississippi Lignite Mining Company (\"MLMC\") is subject to risks associated with its capital investment, operating and equipment costs, growing use of alternative generation that competes with coal fired generation, changes in customer demand and inflationary adjustments.\nThe profitability of MLMC is subject to the risk of loss of investment in this operation, increases in the cost of mining, changes in customer demand, growing competition from alternative generation that competes with coal-fired generation and the emergence of adverse mining conditions. At MLMC, the costs of mining operations are not reimbursed by MLMC's customer. As such, increased costs at MLMC or decreased revenues could materially reduce the Company's profitability. Any reduction in customer demand at MLMC would adversely affect the Company's operating results and could result in significant impairments. In addition, MLMC sells lignite at contractually agreed upon prices which are subject to changes in the level of established indices over time. The price of diesel fuel is heavily-weighted among these indices. As such, a substantial decline in diesel prices could materially reduce MLMC's profitability, as the decline in revenue will only be partially offset by the effect of lower diesel prices on production costs.\nMLMC delivers coal to the Red Hills Power Plant in Ackerman, Mississippi. The Red Hills Power Plant supplies electricity to TVA under a long-term PPA. MLMC\u2019s contract with its customer runs through 2032. TVA\u2019s power portfolio includes coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas and renewables. In 2019, TVA published its updated Integrated Resource Plan (\"IRP\"). The IRP indicates TVA plans to increase its reliance on solar power. A decrease in the number of days TVA dispatches the Red Hills Power Plant would reduce MLMC's customer's demand for coal. The decision of which power plants to dispatch is determined by TVA. TVA has dispatched Red Hills Power Plant at a lower rate in the last two years than in prior years.\nChoctaw Generation Limited Partnership (\"CGLP\") leases the Red Hills Power Plant from a Southern Company subsidiary pursuant to a leveraged lease arrangement. The ability of the lessee to make required payments to the Southern Company subsidiary is dependent on the operational performance of the Red Hills Power Plant. Southern Company recently publicly disclosed that while all CGLP lease payments have been paid in full through December 31, 2019, operational and other risks have resulted in cash liquidity challenges at the Red Hills Power Plant, and based on current forecasts of energy prices in the years following the expiration of the PPA in 2032, concerns exist regarding the lessee's ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments through the end of the lease term in 2047. Southern Company concluded that it is no longer probable that all of the payments will be received over the term of the lease and therefore recognized an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2019. If any future lease payment is not paid in full, the Southern Company subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the Red Hills Power Plant. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to\nforeclose on, and take ownership of, the Red Hills Power Plant from the Southern Company subsidiary. A foreclosure of the Red Hills Power Plant could have a material adverse effect on MLMC's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSimilar to the Company's unconsolidated mines, all production costs at MLMC are capitalized into inventory and recognized in cost of sales as tons are delivered. In periods of limited or no deliveries, MLMC may be required to reduce its inventory carrying value using the lower of cost or net realizable value approach, which could adversely affect MLMC\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in customer demand for any reason, including, but not limited to, dispatch of power generated by other energy sources ahead of coal, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, regulations or comparable policies which may promote planned and unplanned outages at the Red Hills Power Plant, economic conditions, including an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity, governmental regulations and inflationary adjustments could have a material adverse effect on MLMC's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Coal Mining segment's Unconsolidated Subsidiaries are subject to risks created by changes in customer demand and inflationary adjustments.\nThe contracts with the Unconsolidated Subsidiaries customers are primarily based on a \"management fee\" approach, whereby compensation includes reimbursement of all operating costs, plus a fee based on the amount of coal delivered. The fees earned adjust over time in line with various indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates. During the production stage, the Unconsolidated Subsidiaries' customers pay the Company its agreed upon fee only for the coal delivered to them for consumption or use. As a result, reduced coal usage by customers for any reason, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, scheduled and unscheduled outages at the Coal Mining segment's customers' facilities, unplanned equipment failures, economic conditions or governmental regulations or comparable policies which may promote dispatch of power generated by renewables, such as wind or solar, and the realignment of customers' power generation portfolios that reduce the electric power generated from coal could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Because of the contractual price formulas for the management fees at these Unconsolidated Subsidiaries, the profitability of these operations is also subject to fluctuations in inflationary adjustments (or lack thereof) that can impact the agreed upon management fees. These factors could materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nChanges in coal consumption patterns of U.S. electric power generators could adversely affect the Company's profitability.\nThe amount of coal consumed by the electric power generation industry is affected by general economic conditions; overall demand for electricity; availability of transmission; competition from alternative fuel sources for power generation, such as natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar power, and the location, availability, quality and price of those alternative fuel sources; environmental and other governmental regulations, including those impacting coal-fired power plants; and energy conservation efforts and related governmental policies.\nChanges in the utility and coal mining industry that affect our customers could also adversely affect the Company. Lower natural gas prices and increased availability of renewables have contributed to a reduction in demand for coal-fired electric power generation. Competition from natural gas-fired plants that are relatively more efficient, less expensive to construct and less difficult to permit than coal-fired plants has the most potential to continue to displace a significant amount of coal-fired electric power generation in the near term. Federal and state mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources have also adversely affected demand for coal-fired electric power generation. Such mandates make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal-fired electric power generation.\nA decrease in coal consumption by the electric power generation industry and the Company\u2019s customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on the Company and its customers.\nThe coal mining industry and the electric generation industry are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters concerning the health and safety of employees, land use, permit and licensing requirements, air and water quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining, the discharge of GHGs and other materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Legislation mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners also affects the industry. Mining operations require numerous governmental permits and approvals. The Company is required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the impact the production and combustion of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have\nstatutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals and to legally challenge certain permits subsequent to their issuance. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of development or production. New legislation and/or regulations and orders may materially adversely affect the Company's mining operations or its cost structure, or its customers. All of these factors could significantly reduce the Company's profitability. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation\" on page 14 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nThe Company is subject to burdensome federal and state mining regulations and the assumptions underlying the Company's reclamation and mine closure obligations could be materially inaccurate.\nFederal and state statutes require the Company to restore mine property in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan, and require that the Company obtain and periodically renew permits for mining operations. Regulations require the Company to incur the cost of reclaiming current mine disturbance at operations where the Company holds the mining permit. Estimates of the Company's total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and the Company's engineering expertise related to these requirements. While management regularly reviews the estimated reclamation liabilities and believes that appropriate accruals have been recorded for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with closed mines, the estimate can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe Clean Air Act and the Affordable Clean Energy Rule could reduce the demand for coal.\nThe process of burning coal can cause many compounds and impurities in the coal to be released into the air, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulates and other matter. The CAA, ACE and the corresponding state laws that extensively regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations occur through CAA permitting requirements and/or ACE emission control requirements relating to air contaminants, especially particulate matter. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations occur through regulation of the air emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulate matter and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The EPA has promulgated or proposed regulations that impose tighter emission restrictions on a number of these compounds, some of which are currently subject to litigation. The general effect of tighter restrictions is to reduce demand for coal. A reduction in coal\u2019s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation\" on page 14 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nThe Company has experienced growth in its NAMining business in recent periods and it may not be able to sustain or manage future growth effectively.\nThe Company has expanded its overall NAMining business, operations and headcount in recent periods. NAMining\u2019s operating expenses may continue to increase as the Company scales the NAMining business, including in expanding business development capabilities outside of Florida and in providing general and administrative resources to support NAMining\u2019s growth. As NACCO continues to grow the NAMining business, the Company must effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees, as well as existing employees who are promoted or moved into new roles, while maintaining the effectiveness of its business execution. In part, NAMining\u2019s success depends on its ability to integrate new customers in an efficient and effective manner. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures associated with future growth prior to realizing the full measure of anticipated long-term benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, may develop more slowly than expected or may never be realized. If the Company is unable to manage this growth effectively, the Company may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities. The Company may also fail to execute on its business plan or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could adversely affect the NAMining business, operating results and financial condition.\nProperty and casualty insurance is increasingly expensive, contains more stringent terms and may be difficult to obtain in the future.\nProperty and casualty insurance coverage is expensive and from time to time may be difficult or impossible to obtain. The Company's insurance policies are subject to annual review by its insurers and policies may not be renewed at all or on similar or favorable terms. Because the Company is involved in the coal mining industry, insurance carriers may decide not to insure us in the future. In addition, if the Company makes significant insurance claims, its ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. An inability to obtain property and casualty insurance, significant increases in the cost of insurance the Company obtains, or losses in excess of its liability insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company has no control over the timing of the development and operation of its natural gas, oil and coal reserves extracted by third parties.\nThe Company owns mineral interests and royalty interests in seven states in the continental United States. The Company does not develop oil and gas reserves and is not a natural gas and oil producer. The Company derives income from royalty-based leases under which lessees make payments to the Company based on their sale of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil and coal. In recent years, a significant portion of the Minerals Management segment's income has been derived from lease signing bonus and production payments associated with assets in the Utica Shale in Ohio and future royalty-based income is dependent on the number of gas wells being developed and operated on the Company\u2019s mineral acreage in Ohio. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" beginning on page 30 in this Form 10-K for further discussion. The decision to pursue development and operation of oil and gas wells is made by third-party operators, not by the Company, and depends on a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including fluctuations in commodity prices (primarily natural gas), regulatory risk, the Company's lessees' willingness and ability to incur well-development and other operating costs, and changes in the availability and continuing development of infrastructure. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that third-party operators can produce economically. Natural gas wells have high initial production rates and follow a natural decline before settling into relatively stable, long-term production. Decline rates can vary due to factors like well depth, well length, formation pressure, and facility design. In addition to the natural production decline curve, royalty income can fluctuate in response to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including the number of wells being operated by third parties, fluctuations in commodity prices (primarily natural gas), fluctuations in production rates associated with operator decisions, regulatory risks, the Company's lessees' willingness and ability to incur well-development and other operating costs, and changes in the availability and continuing development of infrastructure. Any of these risks could materially reduce the Company\u2019s expected royalty income and the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMining operations are vulnerable to weather and other conditions that are beyond the Company's control.\nMany conditions beyond the Company's control can decrease the delivery, and therefore the use, of coal to the Company's customers. These conditions include weather, adverse mining conditions, unexpected maintenance problems and shortages of replacement parts, which could significantly reduce the Company's profitability.\nThe Coal Mining Segment's customer's operations require significant capital expenditures\nMaintaining power plants requires significant capital expenditures. Any delay or reduction in making capital expenditures to maintain or upgrade coal-fired power plants by the Coal Segment's customers, principally electric utilities, could result in an increase in outage days and a corresponding decrease in coal consumption. A decrease in coal consumption could have a material adverse effect on the Coal Mining segment's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLong-lived and intangible assets could become impaired.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.\nThe Company is subject to the high costs and risks involved in the development of new mining projects.\nFrom time to time, the Company seeks to develop new mining projects, including the Thacker Pass project. The costs and risks associated with such projects can be substantial. New mining projects can take up to several years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks, including delays, extreme weather events, unexpected increases in the cost of required materials, and disputes with third party providers of materials, equipment or services, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of the Company's recoverable coal reserves involve uncertainties, and inaccuracies in these estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nThe Company estimates recoverable coal reserves based on engineering and geological data assembled and analyzed by internal and, less frequently, external engineers and geologists. The Company's estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in its reserves are updated annually to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling, engineering or other data. These estimates depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties and factors\nbeyond the Company's control, such as geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves may vary substantially. In addition, coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves may vary materially from estimates. Accordingly, the Company's estimates may vary from the actual reserves. Any inaccuracy in the reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit the Company's ability to mine coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nThe Company conducts a significant part of its coal mining operations on leased properties. A title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect the ability to mine the associated coal reserves. The Company may not verify title to leased properties or associated coal reserves until the Company has committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. The Company may not commit to develop property or coal reserves until the Company has obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. As such, the title to property that the Company intends to lease or mine may contain defects prohibiting the ability to conduct mining operations. Similarly, leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of third parties. In order to conduct mining operations on properties where these defects exist, the Company may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require the Company to produce a minimum quantity of coal and/or pay minimum production royalties. The Company's inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to coal mining and production may be eliminated.\nFrom time to time, legislation is proposed that could result in the reduction or elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of coal reserves, including the percentage depletion allowance with respect to coal properties. No legislation with that effect has been proposed, but the elimination of those provisions would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of the Coal Segment\u2019s customers benefit or have benefited from a tax credit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code. The benefit results in a reduction to the cost of coal-fired electric power generation. The elimination or expiration of the Section 45 tax credit would increase the cost of the coal-fired electric power generation from these facilities and could result in the power being less economical than other sources of power generation, which could reduce demand and result in a decrease in coal consumption. A decrease in coal consumption by the Company\u2019s customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if NACCO\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted, cease to operate effectively or if the Company experiences a security breach, a cyber incident or cyber attack.\nThe Company relies on information technology systems to operate its business and to record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; purchase supplies; deliver inventory on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Despite the Company's efforts, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power outages, third-party intrusions and other technical malfunctions.\nThrough the Company\u2019s business operations, the Company collects and stores confidential information from its customers and vendors and personal information and other confidential information from its employees. Although the Company has taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Unauthorized parties may penetrate the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. Additionally, methods to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information change frequently and may be difficult to detect, which can impact the Company\u2019s ability to respond appropriately.\nThe Company could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information or for failing to respond appropriately. Loss, unauthorized access to, or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, cyber incidents or cyber attacks could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial of service attacks and other attacks.\nLike many other companies, the Company is the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts in the normal course of business. Cybersecurity incidents involving businesses and other institutions are on the rise. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by nation states or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers.\nAs cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat the Company's or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications the Company may use have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.\nA security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. Any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of the Company's business. A security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage customer relationships and the Company's reputation, and result in fines, fees, or liabilities, which may not be covered by insurance policies. The Company is continuously installing new and upgrading existing information technology systems. The Company uses employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. The Company believes these incidents are likely to continue and is unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to business operations.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of its key personnel and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company's success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain skilled and experienced management personnel. The Company's inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its business effectively and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe amount and frequency of dividend payments made on NACCO's common stock could change.\nThe Board of Directors has the power to determine the amount and frequency of the payment of dividends. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are based on earnings, capital and future expense requirements, financial conditions, contractual limitations and other factors the Board of Directors may consider. Accordingly, holders of NACCO's common stock should not rely on past payments of dividends in a particular amount as an indication of the amount of dividends that will be paid in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, accidents, fires, earthquakes, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the coronavirus, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the environment. While all of the Company\u2019s operations are located in the United States, the Company participates in a global supply chain, and if a disease spreads sufficiently to cause a pandemic (or to cause the fear of a pandemic to rise) or governments regulate or restrict the flow of labor or products or impede the travel of Company personnel, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct normal business operations could be impacted which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s stock repurchase program could affect the price of NACCO\u2019s common stock and increase volatility and may not enhance long-term shareholder value.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program are determined at the discretion of the Company's management based on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, other capital allocation alternatives, market conditions for the Company's Class A Common\nStock and other legal and contractual restrictions. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company without prior notice and may be executed through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.\nRepurchases under the stock repurchase program could affect the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The existence of a stock repurchase program could cause the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which the Company repurchased the shares. Although the stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term price fluctuations in the Class A common stock could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness. Furthermore, the stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of the Company's Class A common stock to decline.\nThe price of NACCO's securities may be volatile.\nThe price of the Company's common stock may fluctuate due to a variety of market and industry factors that may materially reduce the market price of NACCO's common stock regardless of operating performance, including, among others: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in the industry; (ii) industry cycles and trends; (iii) changes in government regulation; (iv) potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism; (v) announcements concerning NACCO or its competitors; (vi) lack of trading liquidity; and (vii) the general state of the securities market. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of NACCO's actual operating performance. As a result of all of these factors, investors in the Company's common stock may not be able to resell their stock at or above the price they paid or at all. Further, NACCO could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to any such stock price volatility, which could divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results.\nNACCO's certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to NACCO's stockholders. Provisions of the Company's by-laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of NACCO's common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nNACCO is a smaller reporting company and cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make the Company's common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures and other decreased disclosure in SEC filings. The reduced disclosures may make it more difficult to compare the Company's performance with other public companies.\nNACCO cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of these exemptions. If some investors find NACCO's common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company's common stock and the stock price may be more volatile.\nThe Company may be subject to risk relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans, which may affect its financial position.\nAlthough as of December 31, 2019, the Company's consolidated defined benefit pension plans are frozen and no longer provide for the accrual of future benefits, the expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to its defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in U.S. pension funding regulations, market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require the Company to increase the cash contributed to defined benefit pension plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe Company may become subject to claims under foreign laws and regulations, which may be expensive, time consuming and distracting.\nThe Company is subject to the laws and the court systems of multiple jurisdictions. The Company may become subject to claims outside the U.S. for violations or alleged violations of laws with respect to past or future foreign operations of NACCO. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. International litigation is often expensive, time consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce the Company's profitability and its ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nCertain members of the Company's extended founding family own a substantial amount of its Class A and Class B common stock and, if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions.\nThe Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2019, accounted for approximately 26 percent of the voting power of the Company. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2019, accounted for the remaining voting power of the Company. As of December 31, 2019, certain members of the Company's extended founding family held approximately 34 percent of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 98 percent of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of the Company's extended founding family could have exercised 82 percent of the Company's total voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such extended family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions, such as certain amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and sales of the Company or substantially all of its assets. Because certain members of the Company's extended founding family could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, the Company may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 28118, "SIC": 1221, "TIC": "NC"}
