{"cik": "100716", "company": "UNICO AMERICAN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-07-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves a high degree of risk. The Company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that the Company does not currently consider material, may impair the Company\u2019s business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of the Company\u2019s securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe Company may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nBased on Unico\u2019s current cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2021, as well as the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there is substantial doubt that Unico will have sufficient cash to meet its operating and other liquidity requirements when they become due during the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nUnico needs to improve its operating results, continue to receive financial support from Crusader, and/or raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund its operations. Unico has taken actions to cause Crusader to enter into runoff and to wind down operations that support the writing of insurance policies by Crusader. To address its liquidity concerns and meet its capital obligations, Unico has announced a review of strategic alternatives and, with the assistance of a financial advisor, is considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, strategic financing, further scaling back, or eliminating some or all of its remaining business operations, expense reduction, reorganization, merger with another entity, filing for bankruptcy or cessation of operations. There can be no assurances that capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company and its stockholders, particularly considering the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the capital markets and investor sentiment. In addition, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of Unico\u2019s existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject Unico to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions, and security interests in Unico\u2019s assets. Many of these potential alternatives will also depend on continued financial support from Crusader to fund transaction expenses and other costs. If Unico becomes unable to continue as a going concern, Unico may have to dispose of or liquidate its assets and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on its consolidated financial statements. Additionally, Unico may have to write down some or all of its capitalized assets or liquidate some or all of its investments in gross unrealized loss position. These actions may cause Unico\u2019s stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in Unico\u2019s common stock.\nUnico is dependent on financial support from Crusader to fund its operations or engage in certain strategic alternatives, and there can be no assurances that Crusader\u2019s financial support of Unico will continue.\nUnico has a history of recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from its operating activities which may continue in the future, and as an insurance holding company, Unico does not independently generate significant revenue, and is dependent on dividends and other cash distributions from Crusader and its other subsidiaries to fund its operations and expenses. Historically, Unico received dividends periodically from Crusader but does not expect to receive any such dividends for the foreseeable future due to prohibitions on dividends imposed by the CA DOI pursuant to the Supervision Agreement, Crusader\u2019s decreased policyholder surplus caused by additional underwriting losses during 2021, and the need to preserve policyholder surplus at Crusader. The CA DOI advised in April 2021, that Crusader was prohibited from paying dividends during the year 2021 and for the years 2022 through 2025. Any continued financial support from Crusader will be at the discretion of the Special Examiner appointed pursuant to the Supervision Agreement. If the Special Examiner does not permit Crusader to continue to provide significant financial support to Unico, Unico will be unable to continue to fund its continued operations and expenses. The Special Examiner has recently informed Crusader that it does not intend to continue to permit Crusader to fund certain expenses attributable to Unico\u2019s status as a public company, including certain legal and accounting expenses. This will exacerbate Unico\u2019s lack of liquidity. Additionally, many of the potential strategic alternatives that the Unico Board of Directors is considering will also depend on continued financial support from Crusader to fund transaction expenses and other costs. If Crusader is not permitted to do so, Unico would be unable to pursue such alternatives, which may otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders.\nCrusader is subject to extensive supervision by the CA DOI and may be subject to further regulatory action.\nOn September 10, 2021, Crusader and the CA DOI entered into a Supervision Agreement, at the request of the CA DOI. The Supervision Agreement was requested by the CA DOI because of the CA DOI\u2019s expressed concerns regarding the financial stability of Crusader and the potential effects on Crusader and Crusader\u2019s California policyholders of any potential bankruptcy of Unico. The Supervision Agreement imposes extensive restrictions on Crusader\u2019s ability to take certain actions without the prior written consent of the California Insurance Commissioner, the Special Examiner appointed under the Supervision Agreement, or the Special Examiner\u2019s appointed representative, including, without limitation, the ability for Crusader to pay any dividends or otherwise make any payments in excess of $5,000 individually or $20,000 in the aggregate. The CA DOI advised in April 2021, that Crusader was prohibited from paying dividends during the year 2021 and for the years 2022 through 2025. As a result, Unico has very limited flexibility to supervise or manage the operations of Crusader, its primary operating subsidiary. In addition, any future financial support from Crusader to Unico will be at the discretion of the Special Examiner. Under applicable California insurance law, the CA DOI has extensive powers, and can impose further restrictions on Crusader. In addition, the CA DOI could place Crusader into conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation proceedings, if Crusader becomes insolvent or if it is deemed to be hazardous to policyholders or the public.\nCrusader is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and its failure to meet those requirements could subject Crusader to additional regulatory action.\nAs a property and casualty insurance company, Crusader is subject to Risk Based Capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) requirements. RBC is a method developed by the NAIC and adopted in the California Insurance Code to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The RBC requirements require Crusader to report the results of RBC calculations to the Commissioner of the CA DOI and the NAIC. If Crusader fails to meet certain standards related to its RBC Authorized Control Level and its RBC total adjusted capital standards and requirements, the CA DOI may require specified actions to be taken, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s competitiveness, operational flexibility, and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, Crusader\u2019s RBC Level was less than 300% of its Authorized Control Level RBC, and its statutory accounting basis combined ratio was in excess of 120% for the years then ended. The RBC Level when coupled with the statutory accounting basis combined ratio triggered Company Action Level Events under the RBC for the years then ended. On March 24, 2021 Crusader submitted to the CA DOI a comprehensive Risk Based Capital Plan (the \"RBC Plan\") to increase the adjusted capital above 300% and to address the actions that Crusader would take to correct the conditions that resulted in the Company Action Level Event. The CA DOI found the RBC Plan to be deficient and requested that a revised RBC Plan be submitted. On July 2, 2021, the Company submitted a revised RBC Plan, which addressed issues raised by the CA DOI (the \u201c2021 Revised RBC Plan\u201d). No action was taken by the CA DOI regarding the 2021 Revised RBC Plan. As of December 31, 2021, a second Company Action Event occurred. At December 31, 2021, Crusader\u2019s RBC Level was less than 300%, with a combined ratio greater than 130%, which resulted in another Company Action Level event (the \u201c2022 Company Action Level Event\u201d). As a result of the 2022 Company Action Level Event, Crusader was required to submit another comprehensive Risk Based Capital Plan (\u201c2022 RBC Plan\u201d) to the CA DOI. Crusader submitted its 2022 RBC Plan on May 15, 2022. On June 9, 2022, the CA DOI requested additional information regarding the 2022 RBC Plan, which information is to be submitted by July 24, 2022. The CA DOI may accept Crusader\u2019s 2022 RBC Plan to correct the conditions that lead to the 2022 Company Action Event, or it may request that a revised plan be submitted, or it may take no action with respect to the 2022 RBC Plan. After the Plans are submitted, the CA DOI may request additional changes to the revised RBC Plan to address various corrective actions that Crusader and/or the Company will take, including, without limitation, increasing the capital of Crusader. Depending on the scope and nature of any such requests from the CA DOI, regarding the 2022 RBC Plan the Company and Crusader may not be able to implement certain corrective actions, including the potential infusion of capital to Crusader. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the CA DOI on various strategic alternatives to address the RBC issues.\nCrusader may be adversely affected if it cannot obtain additional capital for its business and operations. The strength of an insurer is measured in large part by its policyholder surplus. Crusader has sustained net losses for several years which have decreased its policyholder surplus, which has fallen from $26,893,515 at December 31, 2020, to $22,494,454 at December 31, 2021. The Company does not have current resources to infuse additional capital into Crusader to increase its policyholder surplus.\nThe ability of the Company to retain personnel and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to the Company\u2019s success.\nThe Company must retain current employees to handle its operations. The failure of the Company to retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In recent months, the Company\u2019s management team underwent significant changes, including the resignation of its former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who was replaced by Jennifer Ziegler, as well as the removal of the Company\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Operations Officer, who was replaced by Steven Shea, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board. The Company\u2019s current and future success is dependent to a large extent on the retention and continued service of its key personnel, which includes its executive officers and directors, as well as employees in areas that will be important to the Company during the runoff of Crusader, such as information technology, claims adjustment and core insurance operations. The loss or unavailability of any key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and ability to continue its operations.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could adversely affect our business.\nAs reported in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has concluded that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. While the Company has developed and implemented steps to remediate this material weakness, the Company cannot assure you that the processes undertaken to address this material weakness will be effective in identifying and correcting all errors in our historical financial statements. Any failure in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, particularly if it results in material misstatements in our financial statements, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and result in litigation, regulatory examinations, and negative investor perceptions of our company, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and stock price. Further, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to reduced confidence in our financial data or financial performance, which could also adversely impact our reputation.\nThe Company has a history of net losses and could continue to incur substantial net losses in the future.\nThe Company has incurred recurring net losses on an annual basis over the last several years. The Company incurred net losses of $5,673,251 and $21,491,113 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because Crusader is in runoff, the Company will not generate significant revenues in the future and could continue to incur substantial net losses in the future.\nThe principal driver of the Company\u2019s losses to date is its insured losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with insured events by its customers. Establishing adequate premium rates is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and other costs. If the Company did not accurately assess the risks that it underwrote, the premiums that it charged may not have been adequate to cover its losses and expenses, which would continue to adversely impact its results of operations and profitability. Moreover, as the Company continues to runoff the business, it expects certain expenses to continue to increase in the near term. Such expenses may occur in the areas of information technology, claims adjusting, legal fees and core insurance operations services. If the Company fails to manage its losses to keep pace with its investments and other expenses, its business will be seriously harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s success will depend on its ability to adjust claims accurately.\nMany factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to adjust claims accurately, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe training, experience, and skill of the Company\u2019s claims representatives;\n\u00b7\ncontinued access to independent or outside adjusters;\n\u00b7\nthe extent of fraudulent or inflated claims and the Company\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to, such claims;\n\u00b7\nthe claims organization\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of its management; and\n\u00b7\nthe Company\u2019s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support claims functions.\nAdditionally, as a result of the runoff of Crusader, the Company may experience challenges in retaining sufficient qualified personnel to adjust claims accurately and efficiently. The Company\u2019s failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, impair its brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect its financial results, prospects, and liquidity.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on estimates and may not be sufficient to cover future losses.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to Crusader. If claims exceed the related reserves, the Company may not have sufficient funds available to satisfy all such claims, and in any event, the Company\u2019s operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. There is a high level of uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of the required loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for Crusader. The long-tailed nature of liability claims, and the volatility of jury awards exacerbate that uncertainty.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reevaluated certain assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment reserves due to its experiences in Crusader\u2019s Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation Business as well as changes in market conditions. This reevaluation resulted in a $9,399,547 increase in Crusader\u2019s IBNR reserves, net of reinsurance. Crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date based upon management\u2019s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses. The ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events, the outcomes of which are affected by many factors. Crusader\u2019s claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy, current and perceived social and economic inflation, current and future court rulings and jury attitudes, improvements in medical technology, and many other economic, scientific, legal, political, and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims. Changes in Crusader\u2019s operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made.\nThe Company does not expect to realize its deferred tax assets, which may have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases, and for tax credits. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability, reversal patterns of recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, and capital gain generation.\nIf the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company will reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. This charge could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In light of the net losses that were generated in recent years, as of December 31, 2021, the Company has established a valuation allowance in the amount of $11,939,459 for the aggregate amount of the federal and state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets that, in management\u2019s judgment, it is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. After giving effect to this valuation allowance, the Company has no remaining deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized. In addition, the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the Company\u2019s projected operating performance and actual results. As a result, management\u2019s judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by emerging claim and coverage issues.\nAs insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on the Company by extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or otherwise require the Company to make unplanned modifications to the services that the Company provides or cause the delay or cancellation of products and services that the Company provides. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nJudicial expansion of policy coverage and a greater propensity to grant claimants more favorable amounts and the impact of new theories of liability;\n\u00b7\nPlaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including the Company, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;\n\u00b7\nLitigation trends, including higher and more frequent claims, more favorable judgments, and legislated increases;\n\u00b7\nMedical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims;\n\u00b7\nClaims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies, including cyber security related risks;\n\u00b7\nClaims relating to potentially changing climate conditions; and\n\u00b7\nIncreased claims due to third party funding of litigation.\nIn some instances, these changes may not become apparent for some time after the Company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company\u2019s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued. For example, litigation trends have resulted in significantly larger verdicts awarded by juries in recent years in connection with altercations in bars and taverns, and in significantly larger settlements on cases which do not go to trial in connection with tenants-rights, rent-control, property-utilization, and property-maintenance laws, as well as other forms of social inflation, and these trends may continue. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the accuracy of its past underwriting of risks and the adequacy of the premiums charged to policyholders.\nCrusader is in runoff and is not currently writing new insurance policies. However, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the extent to which the Company accurately underwrote risks and set premium during the periods when Crusader was writing policies. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. In order to price its products accurately, the Company was required to collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. The Company\u2019s ability to undertake these efforts successfully was and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nAvailability of sufficient reliable data;\n\u00b7\nIncorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\u00b7\nUncertainties inherent in estimates and assumption;\n\u00b7\nSelection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies;\n\u00b7\nAdoption of successful pricing strategies;\n\u00b7\nPrediction of policyholder retention (e.g., policy life expectancy);\n\u00b7\nUnanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action;\n\u00b7\nOngoing changes in the Company\u2019s claim settlement practices;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected inflation; and\n\u00b7\nSocial changes, particularly those affecting litigation patterns.\nSuch risks may have resulted in the Company\u2019s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate, or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may have caused the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could have underpriced risks, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s margins and profitability. The Company\u2019s ability to accurately underwrite risks in insurance contracts depended in part on its ability to forecast such changes and trends. If it was not successful in doing so during the periods when Crusader was writing policies, the Company\u2019s future operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nInability to obtain reinsurance or to collect ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses could adversely affect Crusader\u2019s ability to write new policies.\nThe availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of Crusader\u2019s reinsurance will increase the risk of loss and could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. Lack of reasonably priced reinsurance may reduce Crusader\u2019s underwriting profit due to higher cost of reinsurance, which could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. Ceded reinsurance does not discharge Crusader\u2019s direct obligations under the policies it writes, which exposes Crusader to credit risk with regard to its reinsurance counterparties. Crusader remains liable to its policyholders even if it is unable to make recoveries that it believes it is entitled to under the reinsurance contracts. Losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid, which may create timing and liquidity risk. Additionally, any losses in excess of Crusader\u2019s reinsurance limits would remain direct obligations of Crusader and would therefore have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and such regulation may become more extensive in the future, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCrusader is subject to extensive regulations and supervision in the states in which it operates or is licensed to conduct business. These regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders, or other investors. The regulations relate to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates, and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. These powers include, among other things, the ability to:\n\u00b7\nPlace limitations on Crusader\u2019s investments and dividends;\n\u00b7\nPlace limitations on Crusader\u2019s ability to transact business with its affiliates;\n\u00b7\nEstablish standards of solvency including minimum reserves and capital surplus requirements; and\n\u00b7\nPrescribe the form and content of and to examine Crusader\u2019s financial statements.\nFederal legislation currently does not directly impact the property and casualty business, but the business can be indirectly affected by changes in federal regulations. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company cannot predict whether, and to what extent, new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict whether such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent this could affect the Company.\nCrusader, along with other licensed insurers, is required to bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, Crusader must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce its profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow the business. The NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.\nMany states have adopted measures related to the NAIC\u2019s Solvency Modernization Initiative (\u201cSMI\u201d), which have included model regulations that require insurers to summarize their key risks and risk management strategies to regulators. The SMI resulted in a 2010 amendment to the NAIC\u2019s Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act, which requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer\u2019s holding company structure to identify and report material enterprise risks to the state insurance regulator. The SMI also produced the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act (\u201cORSA\u201d), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to maintain a risk management framework, and annually submit a comprehensive report designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer\u2019s risk management practices, including risks related to the insurer\u2019s future solvency position. The Company is currently exempt from providing an ORSA summary report as it does not meet the minimum premium requirements. On the federal level, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, mandated significant changes to the regulation of U.S. insurance effective as of July 21, 2011. Currently, the impact of these regulations has not materially affected the Company\u2019s business. Any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on the ability of Crusader to conduct business and/or may result in higher costs.\nThe extensive regulation to which the Company is subject may affect the cost of or demand for the Company\u2019s products and may limit the ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that the Company might desire to do in order to increase its profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework could prove inadequate, which could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks that could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or reputation. This framework includes departments or groups dedicated to risk management, information security, disaster recovery and other information technology-related risks, business continuity, legal and compliance, compensation structures and other human resource matters, vendor management and internal audit, among others. Many of the processes are overseen by these departments function at the enterprise level, but many also function through, or rely to a certain degree upon, risk mitigation efforts in local operating groups. Similarly, with respect to the risks the Company assumes in the ordinary course of its business the Company employs localized as well as centralized risk mitigation efforts. If the Company\u2019s risk mitigation efforts prove inadequate, the Company could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates.\nInvestment income is an important component of the Company\u2019s revenues and net income. The ability to achieve investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Many of the instruments in which the Company may invest are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Any significant decline in investment income as a result of falling interest rates or general market conditions may have an adverse effect on net income and, as a result, on the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity and statutory surplus.\nThe outlook for the Company\u2019s investment income is dependent on the composition of its investment portfolio, the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment. The fair values of fixed maturity investments that are available-for-sale fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe Company\u2019s investments may be subject to credit, prepayment, and other risks.\nThe Company\u2019s investment guidelines allow investing in classes of securities which are subject to additional risks. Rating errors by agencies, such as Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch, and/or economic downturn may create credit risk, a decline in interest rates may create prepayment risk, and a decrease in tax rates may reduce attractiveness of state and municipal bonds and may impact their market valuation. Any significant loss on investments or general market downturn may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stockholders' equity and statutory surplus and its business.\nThe Company\u2019s geographic concentration ties its performance to the business, economic, and regulatory conditions in California.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance business is concentrated in California (100% and 99.9% of gross written premium (before reinsurance ceded) in 2021 and 2020, respectively). Accordingly, unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in the state of California could negatively impact the Company\u2019s performance. In addition, California is exposed to severe natural perils, such as earthquakes and fires along with the possibility of terrorist acts. Accordingly, the Company could suffer losses as a result of catastrophic events, and such losses could be magnified as a result of its business concentration in California.\nThe Company\u2019s single operating location exposes it to geographic risk.\nThe Company conducts its business from a single facility located in Calabasas, California. The Company may not be able to access the building due to natural disasters, civil unrests, closures of public roads or utilities, or other unforeseen events. While the Company has procedures and insurance in place to mitigate short-term access limitations to the building, an extended building access limitation may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s reserve for doubtful accounts is based on estimates.\nThe Company may not be able to collect the premiums it estimates are collectible from its agents and brokers and, therefore, the Company\u2019s reserve for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.\nLitigation may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is routinely involved in litigation, which can be unpredictable and costly, and may result in negative effects on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. By virtue of the nature of its business, the Company is subject to numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either plaintiff or defendant. Such disputes may concern the issuance or non-issuance of individual insurance policies, coverage disputes or other matters. In addition, the insurance industry is the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial and/or indeterminate amounts and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation can be based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices. Although the Company has not been the target of any specific class action lawsuits, it is possible that a lawsuit of this type could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe exclusions and limitations in the Company\u2019s policies may not be enforceable.\nMany of the Company\u2019s policies include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage; these exclusions and conditions are designed to manage the Company\u2019s exposure to certain types of risks and expanding theories of legal liability. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy; this period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought by the policyholders. While these exclusions and limitations help the Company assess and control its loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. This could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses by extending coverage beyond the Company\u2019s underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent for some time after the Company has issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company\u2019s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.\nThe Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data.\nCertain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation at the federal, state, and local level. Compliance with these emerging laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations to date. However, federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Company\u2019s operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense, and loss of revenue. The vendors and suppliers of the Company face similar burdens. As a result of these and other factors, the Company may find it financially difficult or burdensome to acquire necessary data.\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems, and the data within those systems, to manage many aspects of its business. Cybersecurity risks, the failure of these systems to operate properly, and/or the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of policyholder and claims data, including personal identifying information, could result in a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company collects and retains large volumes of internal and policyholder data, including personal identifying information. The Company uses this information for a variety of business purposes, including but not limited to underwriting, claims, billing, and administration. The Company also collects and retains the personal identifying information of its employees and job applicants. The Company therefore depends on the security, accuracy, reliability, and proper functioning of its information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business, including underwriting, policy acquisition, claims processing and handling, accounting, reserving and actuarial processes and policies, job applications, employee management, and maintaining its policyholder data.\nThe failure of hardware or software that supports the Company\u2019s information technology systems or the loss of data contained in the systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums, increased overhead costs, and inaccurate reporting, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the Company\u2019s information technology systems, these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as:\n\u00b7\nEarthquake, fire, flood, and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nTerrorism acts and attacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u00b7\nPower loss;\n\u00b7\nUnauthorized access; and\n\u00b7\nComputer systems or data network failure.\nIt is possible that a system failure, accident, security breach, or unauthorized internal or external knowledge, or misuse of confidential Company data could result in a material disruption to the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as an increased risk of remedial and other expenses, fines, or lawsuits.\nAlthough the Company seeks to mitigate the impact and severity of potential cyber threats more generally, not every risk or liability can be mitigated against. To the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented, and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner, the Company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with the development or acquisition of new computer software, such as in the case of the Company\u2019s planned replacement of its policy administration system, may result in impairment charges if such acquisition or development is not successfully implemented. Any such impairment charges may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operation.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company concluded an investigation regarding potential unauthorized access to non-public personal information as a result of a vulnerability in one of the Company\u2019s websites. The investigation identified non-public personal information pertaining to approximately 15 individuals that likely were accessed without authorization. These 15 individuals were notified and offered complimentary credit monitoring services, and the vulnerability was remediated. While the incident did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, it increases the risk associated with future incidents, investigations, and lawsuits, particularly the risk of damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nIn conducting its business and delivering its products and services, the Company also uses various third-party vendors and service providers. These service providers and the systems they utilize are typically subject to the same types of security-related risks the Company faces. The Company provides certain of these vendors with data, including non-public personal identifying information. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s due diligence or ongoing vendor oversight will be sufficient to ensure the integrity and security of the systems used by these vendors or the protection of information that resides thereon. Adverse consequences for the Company in the event of a significant event involving the systems of its vendors or the information provided to the vendors, among others, could delay the Company\u2019s delivery of products and services, result in a direct or indirect financial loss, and/or result in loss of business and/or reputational damage.\nCertain laws and contracts the Company has entered into require it to notify various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event of certain actual or potential data breaches or systems failures, including those of the Company\u2019s service providers. These notifications can result, among other things, in the loss of customers, lawsuits, adverse publicity, diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, the attention of regulatory authorities, fines and disruptions in sales. If the Company or its service providers fail to comply with applicable regulations and contractual requirements, the Company could be exposed to lawsuits, governmental proceedings, or the imposition of fines, among other consequences.\nAny inability to prevent or adequately respond to the issues described above could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs, or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company.\nData privacy and security laws and regulations are continuing to change.\nThe legal and regulatory environment in the United States governing data privacy and security is becoming increasingly complex and continues to evolve. An increasing number of federal and state laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and otherwise processing of personal data, including HIPAA, HITECH, the GLBA, the CCPA, CPRA, and IIPPA. The effects of these laws, including the cost of compliance and required changes in the manner in which the Company conducts its business, are not fully known and are potentially significant, and the failure to comply could adversely affect the Company. The Company has and continues to incur costs to comply with these laws and to respond to inquiries about its compliance with the same. Maintaining compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact its ability to market products and service policyholders. Any inability to prevent or adequately respond to these legal and regulatory challenges could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs, or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company.\nUncertain economic conditions may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by national and local economic conditions, such as recessions, increased levels of unemployment and disruption in financial markets. The Company is not able to predict the effect of these factors or their duration and severity. The Company may also be adversely affected if economic conditions result in either inflation or deflation. In an inflationary environment, established reserves may become inadequate and increase the Company\u2019s loss ratio, and market interest rates may rise and reduce the value of the Company\u2019s fixed maturity portfolio. In a deflationary environment, some fixed maturity issuers may have difficulty meeting their debt service obligations and thereby reduce the value of the Company\u2019s fixed maturity portfolio; equity investments may decrease in value, and policyholders may experience difficulties paying their premiums to the Company, which could adversely affect premium revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s business is vulnerable to climate change and significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from climate change, natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, and other catastrophic events, particularly hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, tropical storms, fires, sinkholes, war, acts of terrorism, severe winter weather and other natural and man-made disasters. Such events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations the Company holds in its investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these investments, and the financial condition of the Company\u2019s reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Although the Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events, the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by public health threats and epidemics, including the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and any variants of COVID-19.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with public health threats and epidemics, including the global health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that the Company, its clients, their respective suppliers, or governments may take in respect of COVID-19 may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and the business of its clients. Any resulting financial impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. These developments include, but are not limited to, the duration and the spread of the outbreak (including new variants of COVID-19), its severity, the actions to contain the virus or address its impact, the timing, distribution, and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments, United States, and foreign government actions to respond to the reduction in global economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal operating conditions can resume. Any of these developments may materially affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company. The Company in 2020 and 2021, through the date of the decision to put the insurance operations into runoff, experienced a decrease in new business submissions and renewals related to the pandemic in its Bars/Taverns market sector niche as a result of government regulations, such as shelter-in-place orders and in-door dining limitations, which adversely impacted the gross written premium for that niche.\nAdditionally, the continued pandemic has led to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital and debt markets, and adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. It is possible that the continued spread of the coronavirus could cause an economic slowdown or recession (which could adversely affect the investment portfolio of the Company and increase delinquencies and defaults by its customers) or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties that have significant contracts or relationships with the Company become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or services arrangements. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to its operations), agreements with independent or outside claim adjusters, and arrangements for transferring certain risks (including reinsurance used in connection with certain insurance products and corporate insurance policies). The Company is also dependent on its dealings with banks and other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to the Company\u2019s business, it could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect its financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to its brand and reputation.\nCrusader is a participant in various underwriting pools and programs which have legal power to levy assessments to Crusader.\nAs an admitted insurer in several states, Crusader is obligated to participate in various underwriting pools and programs run at federal and state levels. Examples include, but not limited to, a program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 within the Department of the Treasury, California Assigned Risk Plan, California FAIR Plan, and California Insurance Guarantee Association. These underwriting pools and programs have legal powers to assess their participants for net losses sustained in these underwriting pools and programs operations. Such assessments could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s primary goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise which may sometimes conflict with short-term earnings expectations.\nThe Company has not and does not manage its business to maximize short-term stock performance. It also does not provide earnings estimates to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, its reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors\u2019 expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of its common shares.\nIn addition, due to the runoff of Crusader and the Company\u2019s ongoing review of strategic alternatives, the Company\u2019s operations will be focused on controlling expenses, managing claims, and attempting to preserve value for its stockholders, and the actions taken by the Company may exacerbate the volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company is controlled by a small number of stockholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nA small number of holders of the Company\u2019s stock own a majority of the voting power of the Company. Accordingly, those holders have the ability to exert significant influence on the outcome of corporate actions, involving the Company requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, change of control transactions or any other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nInsurance laws make it difficult to effect a change of control of the Company or the sale of insurance subsidiary.\nTo acquire control of a U.S. insurance company or any holding company of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the Department of Insurance in the state where the insurer is domiciled. The Department of Insurance of the state will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction prior to granting approval of the application to acquire control of the insurer or the holding company. These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of the Company or the sale by the Company of its insurance subsidiary, including transactions that some or all of the Company\u2019s stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nThe Company does not expect to declare or pay dividends on its common shares in the future so any returns will be limited to the value of its stock.\nThe Company is experiencing significant liquidity issues and intends to conserve its available cash and does not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to appreciation in value of their stock, if any.\nIn addition, any determination to declare or pay future dividends to the Company\u2019s stockholders will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board and will depend on a variety of factors, including (1) the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including its ability to generate cash flow in excess of expenses and its expected or actual net income), retained earnings and collateral and capital requirements, (2) general business conditions, (3) legal, tax and regulatory limitations, (4) contractual prohibitions and other restrictions, (5) the effect of a dividend or dividends upon the Company\u2019s financial strength ratings and (6) any other factors that the Board deems relevant.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s stock is relatively illiquid.\nThere has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for the Company\u2019s common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock may adversely affect stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider acceptable.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes the Company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in federal or state tax laws could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are dependent, in part, on tax policy implemented at the federal and/or state level. The Company\u2019s results are also subject to federal and state tax rules applicable to dividends received from its subsidiaries. Additionally, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets with an allowance against them included in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. The Company cannot predict whether any tax legislation will be enacted in the near future or whether any such changes to existing federal or state tax law would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. The Company\u2019s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and the Company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nChanges in general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by national and local economic conditions, such as recessions, increased levels of unemployment, inflation, changes in interest rates and the disruption in the financial markets. The Company is not able to predict the effect of these factors or their duration and severity.\nThe Company incurs significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management is required to devote substantial time to related compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, the Company incurs significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that it did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that it files with the SEC, annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition. The Company is also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of Nasdaq and provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which imposes significant compliance obligations upon it.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, have increased regulation of, and imposed enhanced disclosure and corporate governance requirements on, public companies. Our efforts to comply with these laws, regulations and standards have increased the Company\u2019s operating costs and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities.", "PERMNO": 77973, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "UNAM"}
