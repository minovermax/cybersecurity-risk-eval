RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors apply to our business and operations. These risk factors are not exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition and prospects. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including matters addressed in the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Risk.\u201d We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business or financial condition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.\nRisks Related to the Business of Altus Midstream\nOur business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from Apache, and our plans for growth will heavily depend on Apache\u2019s growth in Alpine High. If Apache changes its business strategy in Alpine High, alters its current drilling and development plan on acreage dedicated to us, or otherwise significantly reduces the volumes of natural gas or NGLs with respect to which we perform midstream services, our revenue would decline and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of our current commercial agreements are with Apache, and, as a result, we derive substantially all of our revenue from Apache. Going forward, we expect Apache to be a significant driver of any growth in our revenue. Accordingly, we will be subject to the operational and business risks of Apache, the most significant of which include the following:\n\u2022\na reduction in or slowing of Apache\u2019s drilling and development plans for the acreage dedicated to the Company, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our midstream services;\n\u2022\nthe price, and the volatility of the price, of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could have a negative effect on Apache\u2019s drilling and development plans for the acreage dedicated to the Company or Apache\u2019s ability to finance its operations and drilling and completion costs relating to the acreage dedicated to us;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital on an economic basis to fund Apache\u2019s exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\ndrilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities, associated with Apache\u2019s operations on the acreage dedicated to the Company;\n\u2022\ndownstream processing and transportation capacity constraints and interruptions, including the failure of Apache to have sufficient contracted transportation capacity; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects of increased or changed governmental and environmental regulation or enforcement of existing regulation.\nIn addition, we will be indirectly subject to the business risks of Apache generally and other factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nApache\u2019s financial condition, credit ratings, leverage, market reputation, liquidity, and cash flows;\n\u2022\nApache\u2019s ability to maintain or replace its reserves;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation on Apache\u2019s upstream operations; and\n\u2022\nlosses, if any, from Apache\u2019s pending or future litigation.\nFurther, we do not have control over Apache\u2019s business decisions and operations, and Apache is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that is favorable to us. For example, Apache may decide to allocate capital that we expect to be spent in Alpine High to other parts of its business. Thus, we will be subject to the risk of cancellation of planned development, nonperformance of commitments with respect to future dedications, and other nonpayment or nonperformance by Apache, including with respect to our commercial agreements, which do not contain minimum volume commitments. Furthermore, we cannot predict the extent to which Apache\u2019s businesses would be impacted if conditions in the energy industry were to deteriorate nor can we estimate the\nimpact such conditions would have on Apache\u2019s ability to execute its drilling and development plan on the acreage dedicated to the Company or to perform under our commercial agreements. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by Apache under our commercial agreements would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe long-term commercial agreements between the Company and Apache have initial terms of approximately 14 years, through March 31, 2032, which may be extended by Apache for two five-year periods. There is no guarantee that Apache will extend these agreements beyond the initial terms or that we will be able to renew or replace these agreements on equal or better terms, or at all, upon their expiration. Our ability to renew or replace these commercial agreements following their expiration at rates sufficient to maintain the current revenues and cash flows of the Company could be adversely affected by activities beyond our control, including the activities of our competitors and Apache.\nIn addition to our commercial agreements with Apache, we may engage in significant business with new third-party customers or enter into material commercial contracts with customers with whom we do not have material commercial arrangements or commitments today and who may not have investment grade credit ratings. To the extent the Company derives substantial income from, or commits to capital projects to service, new or existing customers, each of the risks indicated above would apply to such arrangements and customers.\nBecause we have a limited operating history and have generated minimal revenues and operating cash flows, it may be difficult to evaluate our business and ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nBecause of the Company\u2019s limited operating history, the operating performance of our assets and business strategy are not yet proven. Construction of our midstream assets began in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the Company has only generated minimal revenues and operating cash flows since such time. As a result, it may be difficult for you to evaluate the Company\u2019s business and results of operations to date and to assess our future prospects.\nIn addition, we may encounter risks and difficulties experienced by companies whose performance is dependent upon newly constructed assets, such as our assets failing to function as expected, higher than expected operating costs, equipment breakdown or failures, and operational errors. We may be less successful in achieving a consistent operating level capable of generating cash flows from our operations as compared to a company whose major assets have had longer operating histories. In addition, we may be less equipped to identify and address operating risks and hazards in the conduct of our business than those companies whose major assets have had longer operating histories.\nIf we are unable to exercise the outstanding joint venture equity options on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring joint venture equity interests in or benefiting from certain midstream pipeline projects pursuant to the options contributed by Apache as part of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to exercise one or more of the options, either because we do not have adequate funds available or we are unable to obtain financing to fund the applicable exercise price on economically acceptable terms or at all, then our future growth will be limited.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that we believe complement our existing business and related assets. We may acquire assets or businesses that we plan to use in a manner materially different from their prior owners\u2019 uses. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability, or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\nthe coordination of geographically disparate organizations, systems, and facilities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nAny assessment of these risks will be inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition. Realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nWe own or operate a portion of our business with one or more joint venture partners or in circumstances where we are not the operator, which may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by other partners or third-party operators may materially impact our financial position and results of operations, and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from a joint venture.\nAs is common in the midstream industry, we own or operate one or more of our properties with one or more joint venture partners, or contract with a third-party to control operations. These relationships require us to share operational and other control, or to defer to another party\u2019s control, such that we do not have the flexibility to control the development of these properties. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments in such circumstances, our rights to participate may be adversely affected. If a joint venture partner is unable or fails to pay its portion of development costs or if a third-party operator does not operate in accordance with our expectations, our costs of operations could be increased. We could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by a joint venture partner or third-party operator. Disputes between us and the other party or parties in a joint venture may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nIf we are unable to exercise the outstanding joint venture equity options as planned, or if any of the underlying pipelines experience cost overruns or do not generate the cash flows we expect after we exercise, our plans for growth will be impaired.\nOur strategy to grow our business depends in part on our ability to exercise the outstanding joint venture equity options, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to exercise the outstanding options or that, for those that have been, or will be exercised, we will be able to finance the acquisition of the underlying interests in the applicable pipelines or that those pipelines will perform as expected. Our joint venture equity interests and options pertain to pipelines that are either under construction or have not yet commenced construction. The outstanding options have conditions precedent that must be satisfied before we can exercise, some of which are outside of our control. The obligations of each of the parties to close on the exercise of the applicable option are conditioned on (i) no proceeding having been instituted that seeks to restrain, enjoin, or otherwise prohibit or make illegal the closing of such option and (ii) the exercise price having been determined in accordance with the terms of the agreement regarding such option (together, the \u201cOption Closing Conditions\u201d). In addition:\n\u2022\nThe obligations of each of the parties to close on the exercise of the Shin Oak Option are conditioned on (i) the NGL purchase agreement between Apache and Enterprise Products Operating LLC not being terminated and (ii) Apache not being in material breach of any provision of such NGL purchase agreement that has not been cured within the periods specified by such NGL purchase agreement.\n\u2022\nThe obligation of each of the parties to close on the exercise of the additional 1 percent GCX Option is conditioned on the unanimous approval of the members of Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC and the waiver of the preferential purchase rights of such members with respect to the equity interest associated with the additional 1 percent GCX Option. The obligation of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC to close on the exercise of the additional 1 percent GCX Option is conditioned on (i) the exercise of the GCX Option in full and (ii) the exercise of the Permian Highway Option in full and, following such exercise of the Permian Highway Option, us holding less than 30 percent of the equity interests in the joint venture operator of the pipeline. In addition, the additional 1 percent GCX Option will terminate automatically upon the termination of certain transaction agreements between Apache and Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC.\n\u2022\nThe Permian Highway Option will terminate automatically upon the termination of any of the transportation agreements between Apache and Permian Highway Pipeline LLC.\nThere are no additional obligations of any of the parties to the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline Option to close other than the Option Closing Conditions. As described above, some of such conditions precedent are within the control of Apache, and we will have no ability to ensure Apache\u2019s satisfaction of such conditions precedent. If applicable pipelines do not perform as expected, we may experience losses in relation to our joint venture equity interests or the outstanding options (if exercised).\nIn addition, each of the pipelines is subject to risks associated with construction delays, cost over-runs, operational hazards, environmental matters, regulatory matters, and legal matters, as well as other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the operator of the pipeline. If any of these risks were to materialize, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we exercise the outstanding options, we will be required to make significant capital contributions to the owners of the pipelines for our share of the capital expenditures spent through the date of exercise and may, from time to time, have to make additional capital contributions, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe currently own non-operating interests in certain joint ventures, and may own additional non-operating interests in joint ventures, if we are able to exercise the outstanding options. We will be required to contribute our share of the capital expenditures spent through the date of exercise, including any financing charges for certain of the outstanding options associated with our proportionate share of such capital prior to exercising the applicable option. Thereafter, we will also be required to fund our share of any remaining capital expenditures required to complete construction of the applicable pipeline. Once a pipeline is operational, as a non-operating, minority owner, we will have limited or no control over decisions to make maintenance and capital expenditures on the pipeline. To the extent that the operator of one of the pipelines decides to make additional capital expenditures for the pipeline, we could be required to contribute additional capital to maintain our ownership interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe do not have any employees and rely entirely on services provided by Apache\u2019s employees.\nThe Company does not have any employees and relies on Apache\u2019s employees. We will rely on Apache\u2019s employees to conduct our business and activities pursuant to the COMA. Apache conducts businesses and activities of its own in which we will not have an economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to us and Apache. If Apache\u2019s employees who provide services to us do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business and activities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe COMA is subject to termination by us or Apache under certain circumstances, including if Apache and its affiliates no longer own a direct or indirect interest in at least 50 percent of the voting or other equity securities of the Company. Should the COMA be terminated by us or Apache, we will be required to attract and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by Apache\u2019s employees under the COMA or otherwise contract with third parties for the provision of such services, which, in either case, could subject us to substantial additional costs, could cause significant disruptions to our business, may be on terms less favorable than the terms of the COMA, and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe services that the Company offers require laborers skilled in multiple disciplines, such as equipment operators, mechanics, and engineers, among others. In the event that the COMA is terminated and the Company is required to attract and hire employees, our business will be dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor, or the unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges, such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If the Company is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur executive officers and directors may face potential conflicts of interest in managing our business.\nOur executive officers and certain directors are also officers or employees of Apache. These relationships may create conflicts of interest regarding corporate opportunities and other matters. The resolution of any such conflicts may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests. In addition, these overlapping executive officers and directors allocate their time among us and Apache. These officers and directors face potential conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAll of our gathering and processing operations are located in Alpine High, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having revenue-producing operations concentrated in one geographic area.\nOur revenue-producing operations are geographically concentrated in Alpine High of the Southern Delaware Basin of West Texas, causing us to be disproportionately exposed to risks associated with regional factors. The concentration of the Company\u2019s operations in this region increases our exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region, such as natural disasters. Furthermore, the Company may be exposed to increases in costs as a result of regional economic conditions and availability of goods and services. For example, we are relying on temporary power sources until local utilities can install permanent power. If\navailability of permanent power from local service providers is delayed, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the Company relies on the availability of a skilled labor force, which could become more expensive (or at certain times, unavailable) if the labor market in the Permian Basin continues to tighten. Any one of these events has the potential to have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, and prevent development within originally anticipated time frames. Any of these risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are dependent on the supply of natural gas and NGLs to our system, and any decrease in the supply of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe currently generate all of our revenues under agreements with Apache\u2019s upstream development located in Alpine High. None of these agreements contain minimum volume commitments, and, therefore, the Company\u2019s cash flows will completely depend upon the volumes Apache produces in Alpine High for so long as Apache is our sole customer. Further, the Company may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas and NGL supplies. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase the volumes on our system by accessing new supplies to offset the natural decline in our customers\u2019 reserves, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s future growth will depend in part upon whether we can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in our current supplies.\nFluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by Apache and third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. We could see downward pressure on future drilling activity in Alpine High if commodity prices decline below current levels, which may result in lower volumes. Tax policy changes or additional regulatory restrictions on development could also have a negative impact on drilling activity, reducing supplies of product available to the Company\u2019s system and assets. We have no control over Apache or other producers and depend on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity. An ongoing decrease in the level of drilling activity or a material decrease in production in the Company\u2019s area of operation for a prolonged period, as a result of continued depressed commodity prices or otherwise, would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIf third-party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to our midstream systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather or treat do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur midstream systems are connected to other pipelines or facilities, the majority of which are owned by third parties. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines or facilities is not within our control. If any of these pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport, treat or process natural gas and/or NGLs, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny decrease in the volumes that we gather, process, or transport would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes of natural gas and NGLs gathered, processed, and transported on our assets. Decreases in the volumes of natural gas and NGLs that we gather, processes, or transport would directly and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These volumes can be influenced by factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nenvironmental or other governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nincreases in storage levels of natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nincreased use of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\ncontinued fluctuation in commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions;\n\u2022\navailability of supply connected to the Company\u2019s systems; and\n\u2022\navailability and adequacy of infrastructure to gather and process supply into and out of the Company\u2019s systems.\nThe volumes of natural gas and NGLs gathered, processed, and transported on the Company\u2019s assets also depend on the production from the region that supplies our systems. Supply of natural gas and NGLs can be affected by many of the factors listed above, including commodity prices, the decision to recover or reject ethane from rich-gas processed through the Company\u2019s rich-gas processing facilities, and weather. In order to increase throughput levels on the Company\u2019s system, the Company must obtain new sources of natural gas and NGLs. The primary factors affecting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and NGLs includes (i) Apache\u2019s drilling activity in our area of operations, (ii) the level of successful leasing, permitting, and drilling activity in our area of operation, (iii) the Company\u2019s ability to compete for volumes from new wells, and (iv) the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines. We have no control over the level of drilling activity in our area of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our system, or the rate at which production from a well declines. Furthermore, the Company does not have minimum volume commitments in our current commercial agreements with Apache that would otherwise generate a minimum amount of cash in the event that Apache\u2019s production in Alpine High declines or ceases. Likewise, the Company has no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, levels of reserves, availability of drilling rigs, and other costs of production and equipment.\nApache may suspend, reduce, or terminate its obligations under its commercial agreements with us in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nAlpine High Gathering LP, Alpine High Processing LP, Alpine High NGL Pipeline LP, and Alpine High Pipeline LP are parties to a Gas Gathering Agreement, a Gas Processing Agreement, a NGL TSA, and a Residue Gas TSA, respectively, with Apache. Each of these agreements includes provisions that permit Apache to suspend, reduce, or terminate its obligations under the agreement if certain events occur. These events include force majeure events that would prevent the Company from performing some or all of the required services under the applicable agreement. Apache, as the counterparty under these commercial agreements, has the discretion to make such decisions, notwithstanding the fact that they may significantly and adversely affect the Company. Any such reduction, suspension, or termination of Apache\u2019s obligations under these agreements would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWhile Apache has granted us a right of first offer to provide additional midstream services and acquire Apache\u2019s retained midstream assets in Alpine High, Apache does not have to accept our offer if a competitor provides more attractive economic terms.\nApache has granted us a right of first offer to provide additional midstream services and acquire Apache\u2019s retained midstream assets in Alpine High. Although Apache granted us this right of first offer, we can make no assurances that the economic terms that we offer Apache will be acceptable to Apache, and another midstream service provider or a third party may be willing to make an offer to Apache on economic terms that we are unwilling or unable to offer. Our inability to take advantage of the opportunities with respect to the right of first offer could adversely affect our growth strategy.\nA significant amount of the revenue currently generated by us is from contracts with Apache that contain most favored nations rights and other consent rights, limiting flexibility to offer certain capacity to new shippers.\nAll of our system\u2019s current available capacity is provided to Apache under the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, the NGL TSA, and the Residue Gas TSA. The Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, and the NGL TSA contain most favored nations rights (\u201cMFNs\u201d) that could result in lower rates being charged to Apache in the event that any of the rates being charged to other customers are less than the similar rates charged to Apache. Triggering the MFNs in the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, or the NGL TSA could lead to a reduction in revenue generated by the Company, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These three agreements also require Apache\u2019s consent to offer third-party customers priority of service in the Company\u2019s facilities that is at least equal to Apache\u2019s priority of service. If Apache refuses to grant such consent, the Company\u2019s ability to attract third-party customers to our midstream facilities could be negatively impacted, thereby adversely impacting our ability to grow as expected.\nWithout Apache\u2019s consent, the MFNs effectively limit the Company\u2019s flexibility in negotiating rates for some of our services with other shippers to fill excess system capacity, because triggering the MFNs contained in the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, or the NGL TSA would lead to a reduction in the rates that the Company charges to Apache, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTo maintain and grow our business, we are, and will be, required to make substantial capital expenditures.\nIn order to meet our contractual obligations under the Gas Gathering Agreement and the Gas Processing Agreement with Apache, we will have to make substantial capital investments based on Apache\u2019s forecasted development plans in order to have facilities available to provide services at the time Apache commences production from new wells, or shortly thereafter. Apache\u2019s plans are subject to change and there is no guarantee that facilities we build will be utilized to provide services consistent with Apache\u2019s forecast, or at all. As a result, we could potentially incur material capital expenses that generate no return.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we will need to make substantial capital expenditures to fund growth capital expenditures as well as our share of capital expenditures associated with any of the remaining Pipeline Options and the Additional Option we exercise, if any. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to maintain and grow our business, and, as a result, we may be unable to increase our cash flow over the long term. To fund our capital expenditures, we will be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt, engage in structured financing transactions, or sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity securities. Our ability to obtain bank financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our then-current debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions, contingencies, and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Also, due to our relationship with Apache, our ability to access the capital markets or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions may be adversely affected by any impairment to the financial condition of Apache or adverse changes in Apache\u2019s credit ratings. Any material limitation on our ability to access capital as a result of such adverse changes to Apache could limit our ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes affecting Apache could negatively impact our share price, limiting our ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing, could negatively affect our ability to engage in, expand, or pursue our business activities, or could also prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nAdditionally, the capital and global credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption in the past. In many cases during these periods, the capital markets have exerted downward pressure on equity values and reduced the credit capacity for certain companies. Much of our business is capital intensive, and our ability to grow is dependent, in part, upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. Similar or more severe levels of global market disruption and volatility may have an adverse effect on us or Apache resulting from, but not limited to, disruption of our or their access to capital and credit markets, difficulty in obtaining financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increased financing costs and increasingly restrictive covenants. If we or Apache are unable to access capital at competitive rates, our strategy of enhancing the earnings potential of our existing assets, including through capital-growth projects and acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses, may be affected adversely. A number of factors could affect adversely our ability to access capital, including: (i) general economic conditions; (ii) capital market conditions; (iii) market prices for natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbons; (iv) the overall health of the energy and related industries; (v) ability to maintain investment-grade credit ratings; (vi) share price and (vii) capital structure. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained significantly, our interest costs and cost of equity will likely increase and could affect adversely our financial condition and future results of operations.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining the necessary funds to support our growth plan, the terms of such financings could limit our ability to institute a dividend to our stockholders in the future. In addition, incurring debt will cause us to incur interest expense and increase our financial leverage, and issuing additional shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity interests may result in significant stockholder dilution, which could materially decrease our ability to institute a dividend to our stockholders in the future. While the Company historically received funding from Apache, none of Apache or any of its affiliates is committed to providing any direct or indirect financial support to fund our growth.\nConstruction of our assets subjects us to risks of construction delays, cost over-runs, limitations on our growth, and negative effects on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company is engaged in the construction of our assets, some of which will take a number of months before they begin commercial operation. The construction of these assets is complex and subject to a number of factors beyond our control, including delays from third-party landowners, the permitting process, complying with laws, unavailability or increased cost of materials, labor disruptions, labor availability, environmental hazards, financing, accidents, weather, and other factors. Any delay in the completion of the assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The construction of pipelines and gathering and processing facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed the Company\u2019s estimated costs. Estimating the timing and expenditures related to these development projects is very complex and subject to variables that can significantly increase expected costs. Should the actual costs of these projects exceed the Company\u2019s estimates, our liquidity and capital position could be adversely affected. We rely exclusively on Apache to provide certain services related to the design, development, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of our midstream assets on our behalf pursuant to the COMA. Although the COMA provides for certain fixed annual limits on the support services fee\npayable to Apache through 2022, there is no limit on such fees thereafter. As a result, after 2022, we may be required to pay Apache higher fees than would be available from third parties. The COMA is subject to termination by us or Apache under certain circumstances, including if Apache and its affiliates no longer own a direct or indirect interest in at least 50 percent of the voting or other equity securities of the Company. Should the COMA be terminated by us or Apache, we may be forced to contract for services previously provided under the COMA, which may be disruptive to our operations and may be on terms less favorable than the terms of the COMA, and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, the COMA provides Apache with broad discretion to enter into contracts on our behalf.\nOur construction of new assets may be more expensive than anticipated, may not result in revenue increases, and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal, and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to the Company\u2019s existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets (including the pipelines to which the Pipeline Options relate) involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties beyond our control, including potential protests, tariffs on materials used in construction or operations (including steel used to construct pipelines), or legal actions by interested third parties, and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If the Company undertakes these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, the Company\u2019s revenues may not increase due to the successful construction of a particular project. For instance, if the Company expands a pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and we may not receive any material increases in revenues promptly following completion of a project or at all. Moreover, the Company may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in an area in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the construction of additions to the Company\u2019s existing gathering and processing assets will generally require us to obtain new rights-of-way and permits prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities. The Company may be unable to timely obtain such rights-of-way or permits to connect new product supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for the Company to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for our operations, which could inhibit our ability to do business.\nPerformance of the Company\u2019s operations require that we obtain and maintain a number of federal, state, and local permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping, and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit, or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of the Company\u2019s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility or the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAdditionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies, and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.\nWe do not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves and rely on evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves obtained by our customers; therefore, volumes that we service in the future could be less than anticipated.\nThe Company does not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves connected to our gathering systems or that we otherwise service, and we rely on reserves reports if and when provided by our customers. Accordingly, the Company does not have independent estimates of total reserves serviced by our assets or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of these reserves is less than the Company anticipates, in reliance on our customers\u2019 reports, and we are unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes transported on the Company\u2019s gathering systems or that we otherwise service in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in such volumes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDebt we incur may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nOn November 9, 2018, Altus Midstream entered into a credit agreement, which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, with aggregate commitments of $450 million for an initial period until we have met certain requirements, following which, the aggregate commitments will equal $800 million. After the initial period, Altus Midstream may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. Our future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures (including building additional gathering and processing assets or exercising the Pipeline Options), or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nour funds available for operations, future business opportunities, and dividends to our stockholders in the future, if any, will be reduced by that portion of our cash flows required to make interest payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service any debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as not instituting a dividend (or reducing or eliminating a dividend, if already instituted), reducing or delaying our business activities, investments, or capital expenditures, selling assets, or issuing equity. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exposure to commodity price risk may change over time.\nWe currently generate all of our revenues pursuant to fee-based contracts under which we are paid based on the volumes that we gather, process, and transport, rather than the underlying value of the commodity. However, we may enter into contracts or may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in a manner that increases our exposure to commodity price risk. Future exposure to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering, processing, or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable or if the volumes we gather, process, or transport do not meet the quality requirements of the pipelines or facilities to which we connect, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s gathering, processing, and transportation assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The Company\u2019s continuing access to such third-party pipelines, processing facilities, and other midstream facilities are not within the Company\u2019s control. These pipelines, plants, and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements, and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues. In addition, if the Company\u2019s costs to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, our profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in costs occurs, if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unable to receive, transport, or process product, or if the volumes the Company gathers or transports do not meet the product quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe compete with similar enterprises in our industry. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. Our competitors include large midstream companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs than the Company. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation, and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services the Company provides to our customers. In addition, potential customers may develop their own gathering systems instead of using the Company\u2019s systems. Excess pipeline capacity in the region served by the Company\u2019s intrastate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact our ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to our available capacity when existing contracts expire. The Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and customers. Further, natural\ngas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal, liquid fuels, and sources of alternative energy. Increased demand for such other forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, and transportation services. Although we do not have employees, Apache\u2019s employees perform work for us pursuant to the COMA, and Apache still competes with larger midstream companies in attracting and retaining personnel, including equipment operators, mechanics, engineers, and other specialists. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by the Company\u2019s systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs, and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nOur ability to institute a dividend will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to institute a dividend in the future. Our ability to institute a dividend will principally depend upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the volumes of natural gas and NGLs we gather and process, commodity prices, including for crude oil, and other factors impacting our financial condition, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would reduce our revenues and limit our future profitability.\nThe renewal or replacement of the Company\u2019s existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including competition from other midstream service providers and the price of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs in the markets we serve. The inability of the Company to renew or replace our current or future contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on our profitability.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including Apache, and the nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or counterparties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties, including Apache. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, equity values for the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties may be low. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from lower commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the liquidity of the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties and their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to the Company. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties may be leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Company.\nIn the event Apache elects to sell acreage that is dedicated to us to a third party, the third party\u2019s financial condition could be materially worse than Apache\u2019s, and we could be subject to the nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party.\nIn the event Apache elects to sell acreage that is dedicated to the Company to a third party, the third party\u2019s financial condition could be materially worse than Apache\u2019s. In such a case, the Company may be subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party, which risks may increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, the third party may be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Company. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party could adversely impact the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company.\nWe are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by multiple federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Proposals and proceedings that affect the midstream industry are regularly considered by Congress, as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions, agencies, and courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings\nmay become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business. However, additions to the regulatory burden on the midstream industry can increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business and affect our profitability.\nIncreased federal, state, and local legislation and regulatory initiatives, as well as government reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and reductions or delays in crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production by our customers, including Apache, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production is developed from unconventional sources, such as deep oil or gas shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. State legislatures and agencies and other political subdivisions have enacted legislation and promulgated rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing, require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals, temporarily or permanently ban hydraulic fracturing, and impose additional permit requirements and operational restrictions in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. EPA and BLM have also issued rules, conducted studies, and made proposals that, if implemented, could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation. For instance, the EPA has issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and adopted rules prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM also adopted new rules, effective on January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. However, the status of recent and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the current presidential administration is uncertain. For example, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain provisions of the performance standards, but elected not to finalize the stay, and instead, in February 2018, finalized amendments to some of the requirements. In addition, in December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended some of the new venting and flaring requirements, only to have a court subsequently enjoin the suspension.\nState and federal regulatory agencies also have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in induced seismicity, which has resulted in some regulation at the state level. As regulatory agencies continue to study induced seismicity, additional legislative and regulatory initiatives could affect the injection well operations of the Company\u2019s customers as well.\nWe cannot predict whether any additional legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if so, what the provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state, or local level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs, and process prohibitions for the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers that could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs that move through our gathering systems, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nWe may face opposition to the construction or operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.\nWe may face opposition to the construction or operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our construction activities or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the construction or operation of our assets and business. For example, repairing our pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist our efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage or terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that delays or interrupts the construction of assets or revenues generated by our existing operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could affect adversely our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our share price.\nIf our assets (including assets acquired in the future pursuant to the Pipeline Options, if any) become subject to FERC regulation or federal, state, or local regulations or policies change, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of the Company\u2019s facilities, our gathering facilities meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the classification and regulation of the Company\u2019s gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, then the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and the rules and regulations promulgated under that statute. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas gathering and transportation facilities are largely regulated by the RRC, and, to the extent that our intrastate natural gas transportation systems transport natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates and terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311 of the NGPA, rates charged for interstate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate facility\u2019s statement of operating conditions for transportation service under Section 311 of the NGPA are also subject to FERC review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than our currently-approved rates under Section 311 of the NGPA, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for service under Section 311 of the NGPA, and failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline\u2019s FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in an alteration of jurisdictional status and/or the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal remedies. The Company\u2019s natural gas transportation facilities and operations are also subject to the Texas Utilities Code and the Texas Natural Resources Code, as implemented by the RRC. Generally, the RRC is vested with authority to ensure that rates, operations, and services of gas utilities, including intrastate pipelines, are just and reasonable and not discriminatory. The rates the Company charges for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law unless challenged in a customer or RRC complaint. The Company cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us or whether the RRC will change its regulation of these rates. Failure to comply with the Texas Utilities Code or the Texas Natural Resources Code can result in the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal remedies.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas pipeline system is also subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes in Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.\nThe Company\u2019s NGL pipeline facilities do not provide interstate transportation service and are therefore not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction under Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d). Whether an NGL shipment is in interstate commerce under the ICA depends on the fixed and persistent intent of the shipper as to the NGLs\u2019 final destination, absent a break in the interstate movement. The Company\u2019s NGL pipelines meet the traditional tests FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is not providing transportation service in interstate commerce subject to FERC ICA jurisdiction. However, the determination of the interstate or intrastate character of shipments on the Company\u2019s NGL pipelines depends on the shipper\u2019s intentions and the transportation of the NGLs outside of the Company\u2019s system and may change over time. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and the character of an NGL shipment and determine that the shipment is in interstate commerce, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, transportation services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA. Such FERC regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending on the facility in question, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations, and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the \u201cEPAct\u201d), for instance, FERC has civil penalty authority to impose penalties for current violations of the NGA or NGPA of up to $1,213,503 per day for each violation. The maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. FERC also has the\npower to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and the EPAct. In addition, if any of the Company\u2019s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the ICA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety regulations.\nThe pipelines the Company owns and operates are subject to stringent and complex regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity management, such as regulation by the DOT, through PHMSA, pursuant to the NGSPA, with respect to natural gas, and the HLSPA, with respect to NGLs. For instance, the DOT, through the PHMSA, has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for hazardous liquid (including oil) pipeline segments that, in the event of a leak or rupture, could affect high-consequence areas. In 2016, PHMSA proposed rulemaking that would expand existing integrity management requirements to natural gas transmission and gathering lines in areas with medium population densities. A final rule has yet to be issued, although PHMSA recently announced its intention to finalize the rulemaking in 2019. Additional action by PHMSA with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future. At this time, the Company cannot predict the cost of such requirements, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nSeveral states have also passed legislation or promulgated rules to address pipeline safety. Compliance with pipeline integrity laws and other pipeline safety regulations issued by state agencies such as the RRC could result in substantial expenditures for testing, repairs, and replacement. If the Company\u2019s pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the RRC or the DOT regulations, then the Company may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines or operate the pipelines at a reduced maximum allowable operating pressure, the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time.\nDue to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position. Because certain of the Company\u2019s operations are located around areas that may become more populated areas, such as Alpine High, the Company may incur expenses to mitigate noise, odor, and light that may be emitted in our operations and expenses related to the appearance of our facilities. Municipal and other local or state regulations are imposing various obligations including, among other things, regulating the location of the Company\u2019s facilities, imposing limitations on the noise levels of our facilities and requiring certain other improvements that increase the cost of our facilities. The Company is also subject to claims by neighboring landowners for nuisance related to the construction and operation of our facilities, which could subject it to damages for declines in neighboring property values due to the Company\u2019s construction and operation of facilities.\nFailure to comply with existing or new environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or wastes into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nMany of the operations and activities of the Company\u2019s pipelines, gathering systems, processing plants, and other facilities are subject to significant federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which can result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions, or both. The obligations imposed by these laws and regulations include obligations related to air emissions and the discharge of pollutants from the Company\u2019s pipelines and other facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that are or may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for treatment or disposal. These laws may impose strict, joint, and several liability for the remediation of contaminated areas. Private parties, including the owners of properties near the Company\u2019s facilities or upon or through which our systems traverse, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance and to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws for releases of contaminants or for personal injury or property damage.\nOur business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, legislation relating to the control of greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing environmental laws or regulations might adversely affect the Company\u2019s products and activities, including processing, storage, and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. Federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect the Company\u2019s profitability. Changes in laws or regulations could also limit the operation of the Company\u2019s assets or adversely affect our ability to comply with applicable legal requirements or the demand for crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, which could adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nRecent rules under the CAA imposing more stringent requirements on the oil and gas industry could cause us and our customers to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs as well as reduce the demand for our services.\nWe are subject to stringent and complex regulation under the CAA, implementing regulations, and state and local equivalents, including regulations related to controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines, and processing operations. For instance, in 2016, the EPA issued three final rules intended to curb emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds, and toxic air pollutants (such as benzene) from new, reconstructed, and modified oil and gas sources, including the rule affecting storage tanks constructed, modified, or reconstructed, (the so-called \u201cOOOOa Rule\u201d). In April 2017, the EPA announced its intention to reconsider certain aspects of the 2016 rules for the oil and natural gas industry in response to several petitions for reconsideration and issued a 90-day stay of the June 3, 2017 compliance deadline for the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements in the OOOOa Rule. Subsequently, on May 31, 2017, the EPA issued a 90-day stay of certain requirements under the rule, but this stay was vacated by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 3, 2017 and again by an en banc D.C. Circuit on July 31, 2017. In the interim, on July 16, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would provide a two-year extension of the initial 90-day stay. Most recently, on March 12, 2018, the EPA announced amendments to the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, although the agency\u2019s reconsideration of other aspects of the 2016 rule remains ongoing. Accordingly, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of this methane rule. The BLM also adopted new rules on November 15, 2016, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. On June 15, 2017, the BLM suspended indefinitely compliance dates for certain aspects of these rules, pending judicial review, but a court subsequently enjoined the BLM\u2019s suspension.\nAdditional regulation of GHG emissions from the oil and gas industry remains a possibility. These regulations could require a number of modifications to the Company\u2019s operations, and our natural gas exploration and production suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 operations, including the installation of new equipment, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The incurrence of such expenditures and costs by the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers could result in reduced production by those suppliers and customers and thus translate into reduced demand for our services.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas and NGLs services we provide.\nCongress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, the GHG emission reductions called for by the Paris Agreement are not binding. On June 1, 2017, the current presidential administration announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or to establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Moreover, at the federal regulatory level, both the EPA and the BLM have promulgated regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, from the oil and gas industry, although the current status of those regulations is uncertain under the current presidential administration.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that emit GHGs. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These EPA rule makings could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore crude oil and natural gas production sources in the U.S. on an annual basis.\nIn addition, many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and NGLs fractionation plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict whether future legislation or new regulations may be adopted to address GHG emissions or how such measures would impact the Company\u2019s business, the adoption of legislation or regulations imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require the Company to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, could adversely affect our performance of operations in the absence of any permits that may be required to regulate emission of GHGs, or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Company gathers, processes, or otherwise handles in connection with our services.\nThe ESA and the MBTA govern our operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nThe ESA and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. FWS and state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species, which could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state, and private lands.\nOn July 19, 2018, the FWS announced a series of proposed changes to the rules implementing the ESA, including proposed revisions to the regulations governing interagency cooperation, listing species and delisting critical habitat, and prohibitions related to threatened wildlife and plants. The proposed revisions are intended to streamline these processes and create more flexibility for the FWS when making ESA-related decisions. It is not possible at this time to accurately predict how such changes, if adopted, would impact the Company\u2019s operations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds. In these areas, the Company may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to the Company\u2019s activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. In addition, the FWS and state agencies regularly review species that are listing candidates, and designations of additional endangered or threatened species or critical or suitable habitat under the ESA could cause the Company to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, processing, and transporting of natural gas and NGLs, including:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, related equipment, and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural or anthropogenic disasters and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nleaks of natural gas, NGLs, and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\ninduced seismicity; and\n\u2022\nfires and explosions.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the Company\u2019s related operations. The Company is not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. In accordance with typical industry practice, we have appropriate levels of business interruption and property insurance. We are not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe do not own in fee any of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations.\nThe Company does not own in fee any of the land on which our midstream assets have been constructed. Our only interests in these properties are rights granted under surface use agreements, rights-of-way, surface leases, or other easement rights (collectively, \u201cRights-of-Way\u201d), which may limit or restrict our rights or access to or use of the surface estates. Accommodating these competing rights of the surface owners may adversely affect the operations of the Company. Apache and certain of its affiliates\nare party to certain of these Rights-of-Way. Furthermore, many of the Rights-of-Way on which the Company\u2019s assets have been constructed are not perpetual in duration and, upon the expiration of their terms, will require us to pay a renewal fee to the applicable surface owners in order to maintain access to such Rights-of-Way. These Rights-of-Way also require compliance with certain terms and conditions in order to renew their terms, some of which may be outside of our control.\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid Rights-of-Way or if such usage rights lapse or terminate. The Company may obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. The loss of these rights, through the inability to renew Rights-of-Way or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company.\nA failure in our computer systems or a terrorist or cyberattack on us or third parties with whom we do business may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe Company is reliant on technology to conduct our business. The Company\u2019s business is dependent upon our operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our business, including operating our pipelines and gathering and processing facilities, recording and reporting commercial and financial transactions, and receiving and making payments. Any failure of the Company\u2019s computer systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business, including Apache, could materially disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to operate our business. Unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called \u201ccyberattacks\u201d on businesses to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations, and steal funds or data. Cyberattacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and critical business functions. In addition, the Company\u2019s pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist or environmental activist group activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks, environmental activist group activities, or cyberattacks than other targets in the United States. The Company\u2019s insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage our reputation.\nMoreover, as the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities. In addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report accurately our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential holders of our equity could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and cost of capital.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We cannot be certain that our efforts to maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to continue to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our equity interests.\nWe may become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with such act.\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) defines an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40 percent of the issuer\u2019s unconsolidated assets, excluding cash items and securities issued by the federal government. If one or more of our subsidiaries exercises all or any portion of the remaining Pipeline Options, it is possible that some or all of those interests will be investment securities and that the value of those interests that are investment securities over time may exceed 40 percent of such subsidiaries\u2019 unconsolidated assets, excluding cash and government securities, in which case such subsidiaries may meet this threshold definition of an investment company. The Investment Company Act provides certain exclusions from this definition. However, if a subsidiary relies on any one or more of these exclusions from the definition of an\ninvestment company and such reliance is not correct, then the subsidiary may be in violation of the Investment Company Act, the consequences of which can be significant. For example, investment companies that fail to register under the Investment Company Act are prohibited from conducting business in interstate commerce, which includes selling securities or entering into other contracts in interstate commerce. Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act provides that a contract made in, or whose performance involves a, violation of the Investment Company Act is unenforceable by either party unless a court finds that enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement. Similarly, a court may not deny rescission to any party seeking to rescind a contract that violates the Investment Company Act, unless the court finds that denial of rescission would produce a more equitable result than granting rescission.\nIf in the future the nature of any of our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses change such that no exception to the threshold definition of investment company is available to such subsidiary, then such subsidiary may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act provides that inadvertent or transient investment companies will not be treated as investment companies subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided the issuer has the requisite intent to be engaged in a non-investment business, evidenced by the issuer\u2019s business activities and an appropriate resolution of the issuer\u2019s board of directors, within one year from the commencement of the earlier of (1) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50 percent of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (2) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities (as defined in section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act) having a value exceeding 40 percent of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. If any of our subsidiaries becomes an inadvertent investment company and fails to meet the requirements of the transient investment company exemption under Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act, then such subsidiary may be required to register as an investment company with the SEC.\nThe ramifications of becoming an investment company, both in terms of the restrictions it would have on such subsidiary and the cost of compliance, would be significant. For example, in addition to expenses related to initially registering as an investment company, the Investment Company Act also would impose various restrictions with regard to the subsidiary\u2019s ability to enter into affiliated transactions, the diversification of its assets, and its ability to borrow money. If any of our subsidiaries became subject to the Investment Company Act at some point in the future, then the subsidiary\u2019s ability to continue pursuing its business plan would be severely limited.\nApache owns a majority of our outstanding voting shares and thus strongly influences all of our corporate actions.\nApache or an affiliate beneficially owns approximately 79 percent of our outstanding voting common stock. As long as Apache or an affiliate owns or controls a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our Charter or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets, and will be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of the Company that could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company. In addition, under the Stockholders Agreement, Kayne Anderson Sponsor, LLC is entitled to nominate two directors to the board of directors of the Company until the earlier of the time that Kayne Anderson Sponsor, LLC and its affiliates own less than 1 percent of the outstanding voting common stock of the Company or the second anniversary of the date of the Stockholders Agreement. Additionally, Apache is entitled to nominate up to seven directors to our board of directors depending on its and its affiliates\u2019 ownership of our outstanding voting common stock. In connection with the Stockholders Agreement, Apache and Kayne Anderson Sponsor, LLC have agreed to vote for the directors nominated by the other. The interests of Apache may not align with the interests of our other stockholders.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nApache or an affiliate controls a majority, approximately 79 percent, of our outstanding voting common stock. As a result, we are a controlled company within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ listing rules, a company of which more than 50 percent of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a controlled company, and we currently utilize and intend to continue to utilize some, if not all, of these exemptions. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ.\nOur only significant assets are ownership of the non-economic general partner interest and an approximate 23.1 percent limited partner interest in Altus Midstream, and such ownership may not be sufficient for Altus Midstream to make distributions or loans to us to enable us to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of the non-economic general partner interest and an approximate 23.1 percent limited partner interest in Altus Midstream. We depend on Altus Midstream for distributions, loans, and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends with respect to our Class A Common Stock. Subject to certain restrictions, Altus Midstream generally will be required to (i) make pro rata distributions to its partners, including us, on a quarterly basis in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and make tax advances to its limited partners, other than us, in certain circumstances, and (ii) reimburse us for certain corporate and other overhead expenses. However, legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of Altus Midstream, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Altus Midstream, may limit our ability to obtain cash from Altus Midstream. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Altus Midstream may not be sufficient to make distributions or loans to us to enable us to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe may be required to take write-downs, write-offs, or restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we will conduct due diligence on the assets that we may acquire through the Pipeline Options, or other acquisitions that we may make from time to time, we cannot assure you that this diligence will reveal all material issues that may be present in the businesses that we acquire, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise, and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThere is no guarantee that our warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and, as such, they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per share of Class A Common Stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and, as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nAlthough we have registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act, such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nAlthough we have registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act, we may not be able to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in such registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct, or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on\na \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant, and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Class A Common Stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your public warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened, and the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a public warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur public warrants were issued in connection with our initial public offering in registered form under a warrant agreement between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the public warrants, shorten the exercise period, or decrease the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a public warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force the warrant holders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants, or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants. None of the private placement warrants issued to Kayne Anderson Sponsor, LLC (\u201cKayne Anderson Sponsor\u201d) and Apache in connection with the Business Combination will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by Kayne Anderson Sponsor or its permitted transferees, with respect to Kayne Anderson Sponsor warrants, or Apache or its permitted transferees, with respect to the Apache warrants.\nThe Warrants are exercisable for our Class A Common Stock, which will, upon exercise, increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have outstanding public warrants to purchase 12,577,370 shares of Class A Common Stock and private placement warrants to purchase 6,364,281 shares of Class A Common Stock. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of our Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn the future, Apache may receive earn-out consideration of up to 37,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock upon the achievement of certain stock price and operational goals, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nPursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Apache will have the right to receive earn-out consideration of up to 37,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock if certain stock price and operational goals are achieved. To the extent such stock price or operational goals are achieved and Apache becomes entitled to receive a portion or all of the earn-out consideration, additional shares of our Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of our Class A\nCommon Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. The shares of Class A Common Stock issuable to Apache as earn-out consideration have been registered for resale with the SEC. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares by Apache in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Additionally, after May 8, 2019, Apache will have the ability to redeem or exchange its 250,000,000 Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments, and we have the ability to settle such redemption in cash. The Shares of Class A Common Stock issuable to Apache upon redemption or exchange of Altus Midstream Common Units have been registered for resale with the SEC. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares by Apache in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf our Business Combination benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders, or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of our Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline from the prevailing level prior to the closing of our Business Combination.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to our Business Combination, there was not a public market for equity securities of the Company and the assets it now operates, and trading in the shares of our Class A Common Stock was not active. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nsales and issuances of additional equity securities in the future to fund our capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of Class A Common Stock by our directors, executive officers, or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and NASDAQ have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of our securities may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nChanges in laws or regulations or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, investments, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and rules enacted by national, regional, and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, NASDAQ, and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with and monitoring of applicable laws, regulations, and rules may be difficult, time consuming, and costly. Those laws, regulations, and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time, and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities may be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, franchise, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a permanent reduction of the corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of net business interest expense, limitation of the deduction for certain net operating losses to 80 percent of current year taxable income, an indefinite net operating loss carryforward, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations have been recorded in accordance with GAAP, which requires the financial statement impact of the TCJA to be recorded in the period in which the TCJA was enacted. The financial statement impact of the TCJA is based on our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the TCJA and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance relating thereto. In the future, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service are expected to release additional Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance relating to the TCJA. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of this law from any future Treasury Regulations or administrative guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency, and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements, and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following April 4, 2022, the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can, therefore, delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A Common Stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nThe charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, or employees of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the charter, or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case except for such claims as to which (a) the Court of Chancery determines that it does not have personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party, (b) exclusive jurisdiction is vested in a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (c) the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our charter described in the preceding sentence. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, our charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.", "PERMNO": 16673, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ALTM"}
