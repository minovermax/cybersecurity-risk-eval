products are subject to significant volatility associated with commodities markets.\nOur principal finished products in our Feed Ingredients segment include MBM, PM, BFT, YG, PG, BBP and hides, which are commodities. We also manufacture and sell a number of other products that are derived from animal by-products and\nmany of which are commodities or compete with commodities. The prices of these commodities are quoted on, or derived from prices quoted on, established commodity markets. Accordingly, our results of operations will be affected by fluctuations in the prevailing market prices of these finished products or of other commodities that may be substituted for our products by our customers. Historically, market prices for commodity grains, fats and food stocks have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including global changes in supply and demand resulting from changes in local and global economic conditions, global government agriculture programs, energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments, and international agricultural trading policies, the impact of disease outbreaks on protein sources and the potential effect on supply and demand, as well as weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. While we seek to mitigate the risks associated with price declines, a significant decrease in the market price of any of our products or of other commodities that may be substituted for our products would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, rapid and material changes in finished goods prices, including competing agricultural-based alternative ingredients, generally have an immediate and, often times, material impact on the Company\u2019s gross margin and profitability resulting from the brief lapse of time between the procurement of the raw materials and the sale of the finished goods. Increases in the market prices of raw materials would require us to raise prices for our premium, value-added and branded products to avoid margin deterioration. There can be no assurance as to whether we could implement future price increases in response to increases in the market prices of raw materials or how any such price increases would affect future sales volumes to our customers. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the future by this volatility. Furthermore, an increased preference by meat processors for alternative feed ingredients, such as all vegetable diets in the case of poultry producers, could negatively impact the prices of certain of our finished products which would need to be sold to alternative markets and destinations.\nThe prices available for the Company\u2019s Food Ingredients segment\u2019s collagen, edible fats and natural casings products are influenced by other competing ingredients, including plant-based and synthetic hydrocolloids and artificial casings. In the collagen operation, in particular, the cost of the Company's animal-based raw material moves in relationship to the selling price of the finished goods. The processing time for the Food Ingredients segment's collagen and casings is generally 30 to 60 days, which is substantially longer than the Company's Feed Ingredients segment's animal by-products operations. Consequently, the Company\u2019s gross margin and profitability in this segment can be influenced by the movement of finished goods prices during the period from when the raw materials were procured until the finished goods are sold.\nThe Company\u2019s Fuel Ingredients segment, which converts fats and oils into renewable diesel, organic sludge and food waste into biogas, and fallen stock into low-grade energy sources, is impacted by world energy prices for oil, electricity and natural gas, as well as potential competition from the adoption of non-rendered feedstock in biodiesel markets.\nOur business is dependent on the procurement of raw materials, which is the most competitive aspect of our business.\nOur management believes that the most competitive aspect of our business is the procurement of raw materials rather than the sale of finished products. Many of our raw materials are derived directly or indirectly from animal by-products, which results in the following challenges:\n\u2022In North America, consolidation within the meat processing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations, the majority of which utilize \u201ccaptive\u201d renderers (rendering operations integrated with the meat or poultry packing operation).\n\u2022Concurrently, there has been limited to no growth in the number of small U.S. meat processors, which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non-captive or independent U.S. renderers, such as us.\n\u2022The slaughter rates in the U.S. and international meat processing industry are subject to decline during poor economic conditions when consumers generally reduce their consumption of protein, and as a result, during such periods of decline, the availability, quantity and quality of raw materials available to independent renderers, such as us, decreases.\n\u2022In addition, the Company has seen an increase in the use of used cooking oil in the production of biofuels, which has increased competition for the collection of used cooking oil from restaurants and other food service establishments and contributed to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of theft of used cooking oil in the United States.\n\u2022Furthermore, a decline in the general performance of the global economy (including a decline in consumer confidence) and an inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our raw material volume, such as through the forced closure of any of our raw material suppliers. A significant decrease in available raw materials or a closure of a significant number of raw material suppliers could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets.\nThe rendering industry is highly fragmented and both the rendering and bakery residual industries are very competitive. We compete with other rendering businesses and alternative methods of disposal of animal by-products, bakery residue and used cooking oil provided by trash haulers, waste management companies and biodiesel companies, as well as the alternative of illegal disposal. See Item 1. \u201cCompetition.\u201d In addition, U.S. restaurants experience theft of used cooking oil, the frequency and magnitude of which increases with the rise in value of used cooking oil. Depending on market conditions, we either charge a collection fee to offset a portion of the cost incurred in collecting raw material, collect on a no pay/no charge basis or will pay for the raw material. To the extent suppliers of raw materials look to alternate methods of disposal, whether as a result of our collection fees being deemed too expensive, the payments we offer being deemed too low or otherwise, our raw material supply will decrease and our collection fee revenues will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the amount of raw material acquired, which has a direct impact on the amount of finished goods produced, can also have a material effect on our gross margin reported, as the Company has a substantial amount of fixed operating costs. In addition, we utilize an extensive vehicle fleet to collect and transport raw material, for which we compete with other industries for qualified drivers. The U.S. has been experiencing a growing shortage of truck drivers. Our failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of truck drivers to operate our fleet could negatively impact our ability to collect and transport raw material in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nA majority of the Company's U.S. volume of animal by-product raw materials, including all of its significant U.S. poultry accounts, and substantially all of the Company's U.S. bakery feed raw materials, are acquired on a \u201cformula basis,\u201d which allow us to adjust our costs of materials based on changes in the price of our finished products, and are in most cases set forth in contracts with our suppliers, generally with multi-year terms. The formulas provided in these contracts are reviewed and modified during the term and at renewal of the contracts to maintain acceptable risk allocations between us and our suppliers related to movements in commodity prices. Changes to these formulas or the inability to renew such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A majority of Rothsay\u2019s animal by-product raw materials are acquired based on prices fixed on a quarterly basis with suppliers, with the remaining portion acquired on a \u201cformula basis.\u201d A majority of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s volume of animal by-product raw materials are acquired at spot or quarterly fixed prices.\nThe DGD Joint Venture subjects us to a number of risks.\nIn January 2011, Darling, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a limited liability company agreement (as subsequently amended, the \u201cDGD LLC Agreement\u201d) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero to form the DGD Joint Venture, which was formed to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD Norco Facility. As of January 2, 2021, under the equity method of accounting, we had an investment in the DGD Joint Venture of approximately $772.8 million included on the consolidated balance sheet. There is no assurance that the DGD Joint Venture will continue to be profitable or allow us to continue to make a return on our investment.\nThe DGD Joint Venture began an expansion of the DGD Norco Facility in 2019. The DGD Joint Venture estimates completion and startup of the expanded portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the total cost of the expansion project, including the naphtha production and improved logistics capability, is estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Based on forecasted margins as of the date of this report, the expansion project is expected to be substantially funded by DGD Joint Venture cash flow; however, the DGD LLC Agreement provides that until such time as the expansion of the DGD Norco Facility is complete and operational, the joint venture partners shall be required to make capital contributions or, if they agree, loans, to the DGD Joint Venture should the excess available cash in the DGD Joint Venture, as determined and in accordance with the DGD LLC Agreement, fall below $50.0 million. Additionally, in January 2021, the joint venture partners approved the construction of a new facility to be located next to Valero\u2019s Port Arthur Refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, capable of producing 470 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and 20 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha and having similar logistics flexibilities as those of the DGD Norco Facility. The new plant is anticipated to commence operations in the second half of 2023 and the total cost of the expansion project is estimated to be approximately $1.45 billion. Based on forecasted margins as of the date of this report, the Port Arthur expansion project is expected to be substantially funded by DGD Joint Venture cash flow; however, if the DGD Joint Venture cash flow is not sufficient to fully fund the project, the DGD Joint Venture may need to borrow funds or the joint venture partners may be required to contribute additional funds to complete the project. While construction on these expansion projects is underway, there is no guarantee that unforeseen issues will not arise in connection with the completion or startup of either of the expansion projects, and any unexpected significant changes to the scope of the projects related thereto could require investment of additional financial resources by the DGD Joint Venture and/or the joint venture partners, including the Company, which could be significant.\nThe DGD Joint Venture is dependent on governmental energy policies and programs, such as the National Renewable Fuel Standard Program (\u201cRFS2\u201d) and low carbon fuel standards (\u201cLCFS\u201d) (such as in the state of California), which positively impact the demand for and price of renewable diesel. Any changes to, a failure to enforce or a discontinuation of any of these programs could have a material adverse effect on the DGD Joint Venture. See the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Our biofuels business may be affected by energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments.\u201d Similarly, the DGD Joint Venture is subject to the risk that new or changing technologies may be developed that could meet demand for renewable diesel under governmental mandates in a more efficient or less costly manner than the technologies used by the DGD Joint Venture, which could negatively affect the price of renewable diesel and have a material adverse effect on the DGD Joint Venture.\nIn addition, the operation of a joint venture such as this involves a number of risks that could harm our business and result in the DGD Joint Venture not performing as expected, such as:\n\u2022problems integrating or developing operations, personnel, technologies or products;\n\u2022the unanticipated breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including any unforeseen issues that may arise in connection with the operation of the DGD Norco Facility or completion and startup of any expansion projects, including the Norco and Port Arthur expansion projects, or the possibility of equipment failure as a result of materials degradation;\n\u2022the inaccuracy of our assumptions about prices for the renewable diesel that the DGD Joint Venture produces;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering or environmental issues, including new or more stringent environmental regulations affecting operations;\n\u2022the inaccuracy of our assumptions about the timing and amount of anticipated revenues and operating costs including feedstock prices;\n\u2022the diversion of management time and resources;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining and maintaining permits and other regulatory issues, potential license revocation and changes in legal requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with suppliers and end user customers;\n\u2022the risk that one or more competitive new renewable diesel plants are constructed that use different technologies from the DGD Norco Facility and result in the marketing of products that are more effective as a substitute for carbon-based fuels or less expensive than the products marketed by the DGD Joint Venture;\n\u2022performance below expected levels of output or efficiency;\n\u2022disruptions in the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products because of weather events (such as hurricanes), accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions;\n\u2022reliance by the DGD Joint Venture on Valero and its adjacent refinery facility for many services and processes;\n\u2022possible impairment of the acquired assets, including intangible assets, in connection with the occurrence of any other risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture;\n\u2022possible third-party claims of intellectual property infringement; and\n\u2022being forced to sell our equity interests in the DGD Joint Venture pursuant to buy/sell provisions in the DGD LLC Agreement such that we would no longer continue to realize the benefits of the DGD Joint Venture.\nIf any of these risks described above were to materialize and the operations of the DGD Joint Venture were significantly disrupted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur biofuels business may be affected by energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments.\nPrices for our finished products may be impacted by worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas emissions (\u201cGHG\u201d). Programs like RFS2 and LCFS and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad may positively impact the demand for our finished products.\nPursuant to the requirements established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the finalized 2010 RFS2 regulation mandated the domestic use of biomass-based diesel (biodiesel or renewable diesel) of 1.0 billion gallons in 2012 and a minimum of 1.0 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel for each year from 2012 through 2022, which amount is subject to increase by the Administrator of the EPA. The volume mandates for 2020 and 2021 were 2.43 billion gallons for biomass based diesel and for 2020, 5.09 billion gallons for advanced biofuel and 20.09 billion gallons for renewable fuel. The EPA has not yet established final volume mandates for 2021 for either advanced biofuel or renewable fuel or the 2022 mandate for biomass based diesel. Biomass-based diesel qualifies to fulfill the biomass based diesel requirement, the non-specified portion of the advanced biofuel requirement and the total renewable fuel requirement. In order to qualify as a \u201crenewable fuel\u201d each type of fuel from each type of feedstock is required to lower GHG by levels specified in the regulation. The EPA has determined that biofuels (either biodiesel or renewable diesel) produced from waste oils, fats and greases result in an 86% reduction in GHG emissions, exceeding the 50% requirement established by the regulation.\nIn December 2019 the blenders tax credit was retroactively reinstated for calendar years 2018 and 2019 and extended for calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022 at $1.00 per gallon. As a blender, the DGD Joint Venture has recorded approximately $287.9 million of blenders tax credits for fiscal 2020, with Darling's portion equaling 50%. For its United States and Canada biodiesel operations, the Company recorded approximately $8.2 million of blenders tax credits for fiscal 2020. While in fiscal 2020, the amount of tax credits for biofuels impacting the Company was material, legal challenges or changes to, a failure to enforce, reductions in the mandated volumes under, or discontinuing any of these programs could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity, the price of which can be volatile, and such dependency could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the use of natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity. We consume significant volumes of natural gas to operate boilers in our plants, which generate steam to heat raw materials, and natural gas prices represent a significant cost of facility operations included in cost of sales. We also consume significant volumes of diesel fuel to operate our fleet of tractors and trucks used to collect raw materials, and diesel fuel prices represent a significant component of cost of collection expenses included in cost of sales. Prices for both natural gas and diesel fuel can be volatile and therefore represent an ongoing challenge to our operating results. Although we continually manage these costs and hedge our exposure to changes in fuel prices through our formula pricing, and from time to time, derivatives, a material increase in prices for natural gas and/or diesel fuel over a sustained period of time could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also require a significant amount of electricity in operating certain of our facilities, a disruption of which or a significant increase in the cost of which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the affected facility.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is attributable to a limited number of suppliers and customers.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Company's top ten customers for finished products accounted for approximately 27% of product sales. In addition, the Company's top ten raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 24% of its raw material supply in the same period. Disruptions or modifications to, or termination of, our relationship with any of our significant suppliers or customers, or financial difficulties experienced by any of our suppliers or customers that lead to curtailment or termination of their operations, could cause our businesses to suffer significant financial losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCertain of our operating facilities are highly dependent upon a single or a few suppliers.\nCertain of our operating facilities are highly dependent on one or a few suppliers. Should any of these suppliers choose alternate methods of disposal, cease their operations, have their operations interrupted by casualty, curtail their operations or otherwise cease using our collection services, these operating facilities may be materially and adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries and our operations and assets in such countries.\nWe conduct foreign operations in Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. While we expect that our geographical diversity reduces our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also subjects us to the various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:\n\u2022imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by the United States against foreign countries or by foreign countries against others regarding the importation of poultry, beef and pork products, in addition to operating, import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;\n\u2022imposition of border restrictions by foreign countries with respect to the import of poultry, beef and pork products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;\n\u2022change in existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d), which could negatively impact our business;\n\u2022impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or of our assets in non-U.S. countries or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars in those markets;\n\u2022exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials, import or export finished products or to repatriate earnings from overseas, such as exchange controls in effect in China, that may limit our ability to repatriate earnings from those countries;\n\u2022different regulatory structures (including creditor rights that may be different than in the United States) and unexpected changes in regulatory environments (including, without limitation, in China), including changes resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, industry controls, animal and human food safety controls, employee welfare schemes or other government controls;\n\u2022political or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions or other changes in political, economic or social conditions in the respective jurisdictions;\n\u2022changes in tax laws or to tax rates in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse outcomes from tax audits;\n\u2022compliance with and enforcement of a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Brazilian corporate anti-corruption law and similar anti-corruption legislation in many jurisdictions in which we or our joint venture partners operate, as well as economic and trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and other governmental entities; and\n\u2022distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability or increased costs of freight transportation.\nThese risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of our international markets or in other developing markets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSeasonal factors and weather, including the physical impacts of climate changes, can impact the availability, quality and volume of raw materials that we process and negatively affect our operations.\nThe quantity of raw materials available to us is impacted by seasonal factors, including holidays, when raw material volumes decline, and cold weather, which can impact the collection of raw materials. In addition, warm weather can adversely affect the quality of raw materials processed and our yield on production due to more rapidly degrading raw materials. In addition to seasonal impacts, depending upon the location of our facilities and those of our suppliers, our operations could be subject to weather impacts, including the physical impacts of climate changes, changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages,\nchanging sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. Physical damage, flooding, excessive snowfall or drought resulting from changing climate patterns could adversely impact our costs and business operations, the availability and costs of our raw materials, and the supply and demand for our end products. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The quality and volume of the finished products that we are able to produce could be negatively impacted by unseasonable or severe weather or unexpected declines in the volume of raw materials available during holidays, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, severe weather events may also impact our ability to collect or process raw materials or to transport finished products.\nIf we or our customers are the subject of product liability or other claims or product recalls we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe and our customers for whom we manufacture products may be exposed to product liability or other claims, product recalls and adverse public relations if consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness to humans or animals. In addition, we and our customers may be subject to product liability or other claims, product recalls, and adverse public relations resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food additives or other products or from allegations that our food ingredients or other products were mislabeled, were not produced in accordance with the customer\u2019s specifications and/or have not performed adequately in the end product, even where food safety or other product safety is not a concern. In some cases, we indemnify our customers for product liability and other claims related to our products. Product recalls in one jurisdiction may result in product recalls in other jurisdictions, as is the case in the EU, where the European Commission and the EU Member States exchange information about recalls. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we incur in connection with product liability and/or other claims, whether or not legitimate, or product recalls, whether voluntary or mandatory, and we may not be able to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost for such matters. A judgment against us or against one of our customers for whom we manufacture or provide products on a product liability or other claim, or our or their agreement to settle a product liability or other claim, or a product recall, could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating income and cash flow. In addition, even if product liability or other claims against us or our customers for whom we manufacture products are not successful or are not fully pursued, defending these claims would likely be costly and time-consuming and may require significant management attention.\nProduct liability or other claims, product recalls or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands or those of our customers for whom we manufacture products with high quality and safety may result in adverse publicity and negatively impact our reputation and the value of our and their brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, as a result of any such claims against us or product recalls, we may be exposed to claims by our customers for damage to their reputations and brands. Product liability or other claims and product recalls may also lead to increased scrutiny or investigations by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain markets we are highly dependent upon a single operating facility and various events beyond our control could cause an interruption in the operation of our facilities, which could adversely affect our business in those markets.\nOur facilities are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental and other permitting requirements of the countries in which we operate and our facilities are located. Periodically, these permits may be reviewed and subject to amendment or withdrawal. Applications for an extension or renewal of various permits may be subject to challenge by community and environmental groups and others. In the event of a casualty, condemnation, work stoppage, permitting withdrawal or delay, severe weather event, or other unscheduled shutdown involving one of our facilities, in a majority of our markets we would utilize a nearby operating facility to continue to serve our customers in the affected market; however, in certain markets we do not have alternate operating facilities. If any of these events occur in such markets, we may experience an interruption in our ability to service our customers and to procure raw materials, and potentially an impairment of the value of that facility. Any of these circumstances may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in those markets. In addition, after an operating facility affected by such an event and unscheduled shutdown is restored, there could be no assurance that customers who in the interim choose to use alternative disposal services would return to use our services.\nMedia campaigns related to feed and food ingredient production present reputational and other risks.\nIndividuals or organizations can use social media platforms to publicize inappropriate or inaccurate stories or perceptions about the feed and food ingredient production industries or our company. Such practices could cause damage to the reputations of our company and/or the feed and food ingredient production industries in general. This damage could adversely affect our financial results.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of January 2, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill. We are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations or regulation, or changes in competition. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill become impaired, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nOur operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety, and we could incur significant costs to comply with these requirements or be subject to sanctions or held liable for environmental damages.\nOur operations subject us to various and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety requirements in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management, storage and disposal of materials in connection with our facilities, occupational health and safety, product packaging and labeling and our handling of hazardous materials and wastes, such as gasoline and diesel fuel used by our trucking fleet and operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could have significant consequences, including recalls, penalties, injunctive relief, claims for personal injury and property and natural resource damages, other claims and negative publicity. Our operations require the control of air emissions and odor and the treatment and discharge of wastewater to municipal sewer systems and the environment. We operate boilers at many of our facilities and store wastewater in lagoons or, as permitted, discharge it to publicly owned wastewater treatment systems or surface waters, or through land application. We have incurred significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, including for the upgrade of wastewater treatment facilities, and will continue to incur such costs in the future.\nWe could be responsible for the remediation of environmental contamination and may be subject to associated liabilities and claims for personal injury and property and natural resource damages. We own or operate numerous properties, have been in business for many years and have acquired and disposed of properties and businesses over that time. During that time, we or other owners or operators may have generated or disposed of wastes or stored or handled other materials that are or may be considered hazardous or may have polluted the soil, surface water or groundwater at or around our facilities. Under some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 in the United States, also known as the Superfund law, responsibility for the cost of cleanup of a contaminated site can be imposed upon current or former site owners and operators, or upon any party that sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the activities that led to the contamination. Similar laws outside the United States impose liability for environmental cleanup, often under the polluter pays theory of liability but also based upon ownership in some circumstances. There can be no assurance that we will not face extensive costs or penalties that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we have received notice from the EPA relating to alleged river sediment contamination in the Lower Passaic River area of New Jersey. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, future developments, such as more aggressive enforcement policies, new laws or discoveries of currently unknown contamination conditions, may also require expenditures that may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, increasing efforts to control emissions of GHG are likely to impact our operations. We operate in certain jurisdictions subject to the Paris Agreement, which mandates reduced GHG emissions in certain participating countries, and the EPA\u2019s rule establishing mandatory GHG reporting for certain activities may apply to some of our facilities if we exceed the applicable thresholds. The EPA has also announced a regulatory endangerment finding relating to GHG emissions that has led to further regulation of GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been proposed in the U.S. Congress, and a growing number of states and foreign countries are taking action to require reductions in GHG emissions. Future GHG emissions limits may require us to incur additional capital and operational expenditures. EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions also have become more restrictive, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA have adopted regulations that govern fuel efficiency and GHG emissions. Compliance with these and similar regulations could\nincrease the cost of new fleet vehicles and increase our operating expenses. Compliance with future GHG regulations may require expenditures that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have approximately 10,000 employees world-wide and are subject to a wide range of local, provincial and national laws and regulations governing the health and safety of workers, including, for example, OSHA in the United States. We can be subject to potential fines and civil and, in egregious cases, criminal actions if we are found to be in violation of worker health and safety laws in any of these jurisdictions. Further, as such laws and regulations change, we may sometimes be required to commit to unplanned capital expenditures in order to continue to comply with workplace safety requirements at our facilities. In addition, we operate and maintain an extensive vehicle fleet to transport products to and from customer locations in all jurisdictions where we have facilities. Our fleets and drivers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and licensing requirements applicable to commercial fleets, their cargo and their hours and methods of operation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any location could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nRisks Relating to Global Disease Outbreaks or Pandemics\nOur business may be negatively impacted by the occurrence of any disease correctly or incorrectly linked to animals.\nThe emergence of diseases such as swine influenza viruses (collectively known as \u201cSwine Flu\u201d) and highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as \u201cBird Flu\u201d) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (\u201cSARS\u201d), including SARS-coronavirus 2 (\u201cCoV-2\u201d), that are in or associated with animals and have the potential to also threaten humans has created concern that such diseases could spread and cause a global pandemic. As of the date of this report, various strains of Bird Flu have been and continue to be reported in wild fowl and commercial poultry in Europe, North America, the Middle East and parts of Asia.\nOther diseases that are highly contagious within a species, but do not affect other animals and are not transmissible to humans, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea (\u201cPED\u201d) virus, may significantly impact production of the susceptible livestock or poultry species in a country or region. African Swine Fever (\u201cASF\u201d) is a viral and highly contagious disease of pigs and wild boar, for which no cures or approved vaccines are available as of the date of this report. In the past few years, ASF has become widespread in multiple Chinese and Vietnamese provinces and has been reported in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines, Timor-Leste and Indonesia in South East Asia and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea and Mongolia. In 2019, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (\u201cMARA\u201d) addressed measures to control ASF in China in the \u201cASF Epidemic Emergency Implementation Plan\u201d. The resulting restrictions in transportation have created serious dislocations in pork supplies and resulted in strong reduction of slaughter numbers and thereby volumes of raw material supplied to our locations in China that process blood and make collagen from pork skins. Additionally, the perception, real or implied, that blood meal and dried plasma powder may contribute to the spread of ASF, resulted in a temporary ban on the use of porcine plasma in pork feed which negatively affected demand for our products as ingredients in porcine animal feed in China. This ban has now been lifted and porcine plasma is once again allowed to be used in pork feed provided that certain newly established guidelines are met. ASF has also been reported in Eastern Europe since 2007. The disease has been detected in both domestic and feral pigs in several EU (primarily Eastern European) Member States in the past years, and the European Union is taking measures to address the \u201cunprecedented spread\u201d of ASF. As of the date of this report, ASF has not been reported in North or South America. In the United States, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\u201cAPHIS\u201d) has implemented a surveillance plan to strengthen ASF detection capabilities and enhance outbreak preparedness. ASF does not infect humans and is not considered a food safety hazard. Any reports, proven or perceived, that implicate animal feed or feed ingredients, including but not limited to animal by-products, as contributing to the spread of a contagious disease could negatively affect demand for our products as ingredients in animal feeds in the affected country or region.\nAlthough no global disease pandemic among humans has been linked to Bird Flu or other emerging diseases as of the date of this report, governments may be pressured to address these concerns, including by executive action such as temporarily closing certain businesses, including meat and animal processing facilities, within jurisdictions suspected of contributing to the spread of such diseases or by legislative or other policy action, such as prohibiting imports of animals, meat and animal by-products from countries or regions where the disease is detected or suspected. If any disease is correctly or incorrectly linked to animals and has a negative impact on meat or poultry consumption or animal production in any jurisdiction in which we operate, such occurrence could have a material negative impact on the volume of raw materials available to us or the demand for our finished products.\nOur business may be affected by the impact of animal related disease, such as BSE and other food safety issues.\nThe FDA has put in place restrictions to prevent the spread of BSE, and certain foreign governments have also restricted exports of beef and beef products from the United States following the detection of BSE in the United States in December 2003. The sixth and most recent case of BSE was reported in a six-year-old mixed-breed beef cow in August, 2018, which was the second case of BSE since the World Organization for Animal Health (the \u201cOIE\u201d) characterized the United States\u2019 BSE status as one of \u201cnegligible risk\u201d in 2013. While this latest case and the previous four cases were the atypical or sporadic form of BSE, which is not spread via feed and, therefore, did not affect the \u201cnegligible BSE risk\u201d status of the United States, continued concern about BSE in the United States, and other countries in which we operate now or in the future, may result in additional regulatory and market related challenges that may affect our operations or increase our operating costs.\nWith respect to human food, pet food and animal feed safety in the United States, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (\u201cFSMA\u201d) gives the FDA various authorities and directs the FDA to promulgate new regulations pursuant to the FSMA, as described in the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Regulations\u201d included in this report.\nWe have followed regulations enacted under the FSMA throughout the rulemaking process and have implemented Current Good Manufacturing Practices, food safety plans and other procedures at our domestic facilities, which we believe comply with the applicable final rules for preventive controls for human food and animal feed. Similar procedures have been implemented at our foreign facilities for compliance with the Foreign Supplier Verification Programs rule. Such rulemaking and implementation of compliant procedures could, among other things, limit our ability to import necessary raw materials or finished products or require us to amend certain of our other operational policies and procedures. Unforeseen issues and requirements may arise as the FDA implements and enforces these and other final rules or promulgates other new regulations provided for by the FSMA.\nThe FDA has also established a Reportable Food Registry (\u201cRFR\u201d) pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the \u201cFDAAA\u201d), and has defined a reportable food, which the manufacturer or distributor would be required to report in the RFR, to include materials used as ingredients in animal feeds and pet foods if there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such materials will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Finalization of the RFR guidance documents and potential additional requirements relating to the RFR may impose additional requirements on us.\nAccording to the \u201cCompliance Policy Guide Sec. 690.800, Salmonella in Food for Animals\u201d (the \u201cCPG\u201d), any finished pet food contaminated with any species of Salmonella will be considered adulterated, and the FDA believes regulatory action is warranted in cases involving such pet foods because of the heightened risk to humans given the high likelihood of direct human contact with pet food. Finished animal feeds intended for pigs, poultry and other farmed animals, however, will be considered to be adulterated only if the feed is contaminated with a species of Salmonella that is considered to be pathogenic for the animal species for which the feed is intended. Any pathogen, such as Salmonella, that is correctly or incorrectly associated with our finished products could have a negative impact on the demand for our finished products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs a result of our international operations, we could be adversely affected by additional non-U.S. regulations regarding BSE and other food safety issues. For example, an enforceable ban on the feeding of restricted animal material to ruminant animals is in place in Australia as part of a comprehensive national program to prevent the entry and establishment of the BSE agent in Australia and inspections and audits are undertaken to ensure compliance. In addition, in the EU, harmonized rules have been adopted for prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (\u201cTSEs\u201d), which includes BSE, in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended (\u201cTSE Regulation\u201d) and in other instruments such as Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 on animal by-products, as amended (\u201cAnimal By-Products Regulation\u201d) and other food and feed hygiene regulations. The TSE Regulation establishes a \u201cfeed ban\u201d consisting of a ban on the use of processed animal protein (\u201cPAP\u201d), in feed for ruminants. Only certain animal proteins considered to be safe (such as fishmeal) can be used, but under very strict conditions. A ban on feeding MBM to ruminants has been in place in the EU since 1994. The ban was expanded in 2001 with the prohibition of feeding all PAP to all farmed animals, subject to certain limited exceptions. In 2009, the BSE-related feed ban was supplemented with provisions prohibiting intra-species recycling applicable to all food-producing animals. Other animal-derived products besides PAP, such as collagen derived from non-ruminants and hydrolyzed protein derived from parts of non-ruminants or from ruminant hides and skins, are not subject to the \u201cfeed ban.\u201d The \u201cfeed ban\u201d has been lifted for pig and poultry PAP in the feed of aquaculture animals, and insect PAP (a new source of animal protein) in the feed of aquaculture animals. The European Commission aims to present proposals to authorize the feeding of non-ruminant farmed animals with insect PAP, and to reauthorize the feeding of poultry with pig PAP and the feeding of pigs with poultry PAP.\nAlthough Darling Ingredients International may profit from the possible lifting of the ban for pigs and poultry, changes to the \u201cfeed ban\u201d may also adversely affect Darling Ingredients International, possibly restricting the allowed use of some of their products. The TSE Regulation applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin on the EU market. For that purpose, the BSE status of EU Member States, non-EU members of the European Economic Area and other countries or regions (\u201cThird Countries\u201d) is to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved: a negligible risk, a controlled risk or an undetermined risk. This classification is made by the OIE. The determination of BSE status is based on a risk assessment and the implementation of a surveillance program. For each risk category there are trade rules to provide the necessary guarantees for protecting public and animal health. Currently, the following EU Member States are classified as having a controlled BSE risk: France, Greece and Ireland. The other EU Member States are classified as having a negligible BSE risk. A change in the BSE status of one or more EU Member States may have a negative impact on Darling Ingredients International. Under EU legislation, imported products from outside the EU must meet the same safety standards as products produced in EU Member States. Therefore, the TSE Regulation imposes strict import requirements related to TSEs for live animals and animal by-products, such as full traceability of imported animals and animal by-products, a ban on the use of MBM in feed for ruminants and the prohibition of the import of specified risk material or mechanically recovered meat. The detailed import requirements depend on the BSE status of Third Countries. The Animal By-Products Regulation establishes rules intended to prevent the outbreak of certain diseases such as BSE. It imposes, for example, rules for the use and disposal of specified risk material and other high risk material. A BSE outbreak or other event viewed as hazardous to animal or human health could lead to the adoption of more stringent rules on the use and disposal of animal by-products, which could require Darling Ingredients International to change its production processes and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, the introduction of new EU legislation applicable to the agri-food sector could create additional compliance requirements and enforcement risks for us. Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 (\u201cFood Transparency Regulation\u201d) will apply from March 27, 2021. The Food Transparency Regulation strengthens transparency requirements in EU food law. Among other things, the European Food Safety Authority (\u201cEFSA\u201d) will be required to disclose scientific data, studies and other information supporting applications, including supplementary information supplied by applicants, taking into account the protection of confidential information and of personal data. EFSA is tasked with establishing and managing a publicly accessible database of studies commissioned or carried out by business operators to support an application or notification in relation to which EU law contains provisions for EFSA to provide a scientific output, including a scientific opinion. Business operators will need to notify EFSA of the title and the scope of any study commissioned or carried out by them to support an application or a notification, as well as the laboratory or testing facility carrying out that study, and its starting and planned completion dates. Any potential disclosure of unfavorable studies and data as well as EFSA\u2019s ultimate decision-making power to determine what constitutes confidential information (and therefore subject or not to transparency obligations) may result in adverse publicity, negatively impact our reputation and/or require us to disclose commercially sensitive information and data. Regulation (EC) No 2017/625 (\u201cOfficial Controls Regulation\u201d) requires that the EU Member States verify compliance with agri-food chain rules through official controls. The scope of the Official Controls Regulation has been extended and will now cover official controls to verify compliance with food and feed law, animal health and welfare, plant health and animal-by products rules. To deter fraudulent practices, the Official Controls Regulation introduces more stringent rules for financial penalties, imposed by EU Member States. Those penalties must reflect the economic advantage of the operator or a percentage of the operator\u2019s turnover. The Regulation also introduces new provisions to protect whistle-blowers to encourage and facilitate the reporting of non-compliance. More stringent and higher financial penalties may potentially result in significant and unexpected costs and enhanced provisions regarding whistle-blowers may result in more regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), may disrupt our business, including, among other things, our supply chain and production processes, each of which could materially affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as COVID-19, could negatively affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. While to date we have experienced no material negative effects on our business and results of operations as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change, including but not limited to changes that may materially affect the operations of our supply chain partners and finished product customers, which ultimately could result in material negative effects on our business and results of operations.\nThe spread of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 may disrupt our third-party business partners\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us, which may negatively affect our operations. These third parties include those who supply our raw materials and other necessary operating materials and logistics and transportation services providers. Ports and other channels of entry may be closed or operate at only a portion of capacity, as workers may be prohibited or otherwise\nunable to report to work, and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason. As a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans have been put in place and global supply may become constrained, each of which may cause the price of certain raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations. In addition, COVID-19 and similar outbreaks may affect the prices and demand for our finished products.\nWorkforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 and related government actions may affect many aspects of our business. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations and financial reporting capabilities may be negatively affected. In addition, pandemics or disease outbreaks could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our raw material supply and our customers\u2019 demand for our finished products.\nOur efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any pandemic, epidemic or disease outbreak, as well as third party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects.\nThe risks described above also apply to the DGD Joint Venture and its business and operations.\nRisks Related to our Labor Force\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our operating facilities, which could cause interruptions in the manufacturing or distribution of our products.\nWhile we currently have no international, national or multi-plant union contracts, as of January 2, 2021 approximately 19% of Darling\u2019s U.S. employees, 26% of Rothsay\u2019s employees and 44% of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, local laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate provide for worker groups with prescribed powers and rights with regard to working conditions, wages and similar matters. In jurisdictions where such groups do not exist, labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized and higher ongoing labor costs. Darling\u2019s collective bargaining agreements expire at varying times over the next five years. In contrast, Darling Ingredients International\u2019s collective bargaining agreements generally have one to two year terms, while Rothsay agreements generally have terms up to three years. Some of our collective bargaining agreements have already expired and are in the process of being renegotiated. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expiring or expired agreement in a manner acceptable to us. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or other collective action in the future in any of our locations, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements that could have a direct or indirect adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nCertain U.S. multiemployer defined benefit pension plans to which we contribute are underfunded and these plans may require minimum funding contributions.\nWe participate in various U.S. multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Based upon the most currently available information, certain of these multiemployer plans are underfunded due partially to a decline in the value of the assets supporting these plans, a reduction in the number of actively participating members for whom employer contributions are required and the level of benefits provided by the plans. In addition, the U.S. Pension Protection Act, which went into effect in January 2008, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. Furthermore, under current law, a termination of, our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan to which we contribute would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. Also, if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers not contributing their allocable share of the minimum funding to the plan. Requirements to pay increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of January 2, 2021, our total indebtedness, including trade debt, was approximately $1.5 billion and we had undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the revolving loan facility included as part of our senior secured credit facilities of up to approximately $893.9 million (after giving effect to approximately $55.0 million of revolver borrowing, $3.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and $47.2 million of ancillary facilities). Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations to our financial lenders and our contractual and commercial commitments; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness instead of for other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows from operations available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022increasing our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate conversion to functional currency;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our funded indebtedness. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities,\u201d \u201c5.25% Senior Notes due 2027\u201d and \u201c3.625% Senior Notes due 2026.\u201d\nDespite our existing level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nAlthough the indentures that govern the senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that we and our subsidiaries could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our indebtedness, including our possible inability to service our indebtedness, could intensify. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities,\u201d \u201c5.25% Senior Notes due 2027\u201d and \u201c3.625% Senior Notes due 2026.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and to meet our other cash needs, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such\nalternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and our other cash needs. The credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from the disposition of assets, debt incurrence or sales of equity to repay other indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate any such dispositions or to obtain debt or equity proceeds in amounts sufficient to meet any debt service obligations, and we may be restricted under such credit agreement or indentures from using any such amounts to service other debt obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments under any of the agreements governing our debt, we would be in default under such agreements, which could allow lenders under any credit facilities to terminate their commitments to loan money and could allow the applicable lenders or other debt holders to declare all outstanding principal and interest of such debt to be immediately due and payable, and, in the case of secured debt, to foreclose against the assets securing such debt and apply the proceeds from such foreclosure to repay amounts owed to them. Any of these events would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in our other debt instruments, which would allow the creditors under those instruments to exercise similar rights. If any of these actions are taken, we could be forced into restructuring, bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness depends in part on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, a number of which operate outside the United States. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us. Unless they are guarantors of the indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. For example, our subsidiaries that are organized under the laws of, and operate in, China currently have substantial regulatory restrictions on their ability to make cash available to us. While the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness will limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility and, in the future, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this report, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in ingredient prices;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022our earnings releases and financial performance;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022our ability to repay our debt;\n\u2022our access to financial and capital markets to refinance our debt;\n\u2022performance of our joint venture investments, including the DGD Joint Venture;\n\u2022our dividend policy;\n\u2022market conditions in the industry and the general state of the securities markets;\n\u2022investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u2022governmental legislation or regulation;\n\u2022currency and exchange rate fluctuations that impact our earnings and balance sheet; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions, such as U.S. or global reactions to economic developments, including regional recessions, currency devaluations or political unrest.\nOur ability to pay any dividends on our common stock may be limited and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since January 3, 1989 and we have no current plans to do so. Our current financing arrangements permit us to pay cash dividends on our common stock within limitations defined by the terms of our existing indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facility, 5.25% senior notes due 2027 and 3.625% senior notes due 2026 and any other indentures or other financing arrangements that we enter into in the future. For example, our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make payments of dividends in cash if certain coverage ratios are not met. Even if such coverage ratios are met in the future, any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be based upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, plans for expansion, business opportunities, restrictions imposed by any of our financing arrangements, provisions of applicable law and any other factors that our board of directors determines are relevant at that point in time.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the issuance of other equity may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including our outstanding options, or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is an equity security and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the shares of common stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness, including our trade debt, and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Our existing indebtedness restricts, and future indebtedness may restrict, payment of dividends on the common stock.\nUnlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted under applicable Delaware law to making dividend payments and redemption payments only from legally available assets. Further, under our certificate of incorporation, there are no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions arising as to our common stock, subject only to the voting rights available to stockholders generally.\nIn addition, our rights to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors (except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor of that subsidiary), including that subsidiary\u2019s trade creditors and our creditors who have obtained or may obtain guarantees from the subsidiaries. As a result, our common stock will be subordinated to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations and liabilities, which currently include borrowings and guarantees. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities,\u201d \u201c5.25% Senior Notes due 2027\u201d and \u201c3.625% Senior Notes due 2026.\u201d\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock, which may negatively impact your investment.\nOur board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. The board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred shares that may be issued, including the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected. As of the date of this report, we have no outstanding shares of preferred stock but we have available for issuance 1,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.\nGeneral Risks Related to our Business\nWe may incur material costs and liabilities in complying with government regulations.\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of various governmental agencies in the United States, the EU, Canada, China and the other countries in which Darling Ingredients International operates. These include rules and regulations administered by governmental agencies at the supranational, federal, state, provincial or local level. See Item 1. \"Business - Regulations\" for a listing of certain governmental agencies to which we are subject.\nThe applicable rules, regulations and guidance promulgated by these and other agencies, which are likely to change over time, affect our operations and may influence our operating results at one or more facilities. Furthermore, the loss of or failure to obtain necessary federal, state, provincial or local permits and registrations at one or more of our facilities could halt or curtail operations at impacted facilities, which could result in impairment charges related to the affected facility and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules, regulations and guidance, including obtaining or maintaining required operating certificates or permits, could subject us to: (i) administrative penalties and injunctive relief; (ii) civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and product recalls; and/or (iii) adverse publicity. There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with these rules, regulations and guidance.\nBecause of our international operations throughout much of the world, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws, as well as laws and regulations governing international transactions (such as the regulations administered by OFAC). Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we may enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with anti-bribery laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners will violate the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws and regulations, as well as OFAC and economic sanctions. While our policies mandate compliance with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, as well as OFAC and economic sanctions, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from violations committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws, or of OFAC or other economic sanctions laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in lengthy investigations and possibly disrupt our business, lead to criminal and/or civil legal proceedings brought by governmental agencies and/or third parties, result in material fines and legal and other costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nGiven the competitive nature of our industry, we could be adversely affected by violations of various countries\u2019 antitrust, competition and consumer protection laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and individuals from engaging in anticompetitive and unfair business practices. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from violations or reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents.\nDownturns and volatility in global economies and commodity and credit markets could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by the conditions of the global economies and the credit, commodities and stock markets. Among other things, we may be adversely impacted if our domestic and international customers and suppliers are not able to access sufficient capital to continue to operate their businesses or to operate them at prior levels. A\ndecline in consumer confidence or changing patterns in the availability and use of disposable income by consumers can negatively affect both our suppliers and customers. Declining discretionary consumer spending or the loss or impairment of a meaningful number of our suppliers or customers could lead to declines in either raw material availability or customer demand. Any tightening in credit supply could negatively affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products on a timely basis or at all and could result in a requirement for additional bad debt reserves. Although many of our customer contracts are formula-based, continued volatility in the commodities markets could negatively impact our revenues and overall profits. Counterparty risk on finished product sales can also impact revenue and operating profits when customers either are unable to obtain credit or refuse to take delivery of finished products due to market price declines.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, which could affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants.\nWe carry out transactions in a number of foreign currencies, principally the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty. To the extent possible, we attempt to match revenues and expenses in each of the currencies in which we operate. However, we will still be exposed to currency fluctuations when we translate the results of our overseas operations into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which may affect our U.S. dollar-denominated results of operations and financial condition even if our underlying operations and financial condition, in local currency terms, remain unchanged. While we from time to time utilize currency hedging instruments to protect us from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such instruments will successfully protect us from more pronounced swings in such exchange rates. Further, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that result from favorable fluctuations in exchange rates.\nWe also face risks arising from the possible future imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries located in, or business conducted within, a country imposing such controls. Currency devaluations would result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nAny fluctuations in exchange rates or the imposition of exchange controls or currency devaluation may adversely impact our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants under the documents governing our indebtedness, which could affect our ability to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments or take other actions that might be in our best interest. Should our international operations continue to expand, they will represent a larger part of our business and such exchange rate fluctuations may have a greater impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLarge capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns.\nWe may engage in capital projects, such as the DGD Joint Venture expansion projects, based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. Large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. As a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in consumer preference could negatively impact our business.\nThe food and pet food industries in general are subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food and pet food industries change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our products or those of our customers for whom we manufacture products, and could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we experience difficulties or a significant disruption in our information systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout our business to collect and process data that is critical to our operations and accurate financial reporting. Among other things, these information systems process incoming customer orders and outgoing supplier orders, manage inventory, and allow us to efficiently collect raw materials and distribute products, process and bill shipments to and collect cash from our customers, respond to customer and supplier inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment, record and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors and manage our human resource function.\nIf we were to experience a disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with suppliers and customers, it could result in a loss of raw material supplies, sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such disruption could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. We may also encounter difficulties in developing and implementing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems and software. Such difficulties may lead to significant expenses or losses due to unexpected additional costs required to implement or maintain systems, disruption in business operations, loss of sales or profits, or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages, and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could also experience impairment of our reputation if any of these events were to occur.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon our information systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. Increased security threats to information systems and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We are the subject of cyber attacks from time to time, and must invest resources to protect our systems and defend against and respond to incidents. A failure of or breach in technology security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operating disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nFurthermore, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, know-your-customer requirements, data protection, cross-border data movement and other matters. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices or inconsistent with one another. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or employees in our possession is mishandled or misused, we may face regulatory, reputational and operational risks which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, European legislators adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) that became effective in May 2018, and supersedes EU data protection legislation, imposes more stringent data protection requirements, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. There are significant outstanding questions relating to the scope and applicability of GDPR for companies such as ours. We may face difficulty in fully complying with these regulations and any failure to do so could subject us to significant monetary penalties, liabilities, and adverse publicity. Further, California recently enacted a privacy law (the \u201cCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\u201d or \u201cCCPA\u201d), which may limit how we may collect and use personal data, and which came into effect in January 2020. As draft regulations have not yet been finalized and additional state privacy laws may be enacted, the impact of these state privacy laws on us and others in our industry is uncertain. We also may be required to expend significant resources to prepare for and comply with the evolving standards. We could be adversely affected if the CCPA and other states\u2019 legislation or regulations require changes in our business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on our key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees, including members of senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, motivate and retain skilled technical, managerial, marketing and sales personnel. Competition for these types of skilled personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting, motivating and retaining key personnel. The failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that would require remediation.\nAny future failures to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, could subject us to a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting and in the integrity of our financial statements and our public filings with the SEC and other governmental agencies and could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our regulatory reporting obligations in a timely manner.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision, tax assets, and accruals for other taxes, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or tax rates. Furthermore, we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and other non-income taxes. Unfavorable audit results or tax rulings, or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities, could have material adverse effects upon our earnings, cash flows, and financial condition.\nLitigation or regulatory proceedings may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to various lawsuits, claims and loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including insured worker's compensation, auto, and general liability claims, assertions by certain regulatory and governmental agencies related to permitting requirements and/or air, wastewater and storm water discharges from the Company\u2019s processing facilities, litigation involving tort, contract, statutory, labor, employment, and other claims, and tax matters. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, and regulatory proceedings is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs (including governmental agencies) in these types of lawsuits and proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits or proceedings may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The costs of responding to or defending future litigation or regulatory proceedings may be significant and any future litigation or regulatory proceedings may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation or regulatory proceedings that may decrease customer confidence in our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation or regulatory proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information related to our litigation and regulatory proceedings, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur European pension funds may require minimum funding contributions.\nIn the UK and the EU, pension funds are generally subject to the Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive (Directive 2003/41/EC) (the \u201cIORP Directive\u201d) as implemented in the relevant EU Member States (and the UK). The IORP Directive provides for certain general solvency requirements but allows EU Member States discretion to impose specific national requirements. As a result, the solvency of EU pension funds are mostly regulated on a national level. On December 23, 2016, the new IORP Directive (\u201cIORP Directive II\u201d) was published on the Official Journal of the European Union and entered into force on January 12, 2017, though this did not make substantive changes to the solvency requirements under the original IORP Directive. The new IORP Directive recognizes in one of its recitals that changes in this area could potentially decrease the willingness of employers to provide occupational pension schemes. EU Member States were required to implement IORP Directive II into national legislation by January 13, 2019. The UK introduced new legislation with effect from 13 January 2019 to implement certain parts of IORP Directive II: (i) the Occupational Pension Schemes (Governance) (Amendment) Regulations 2018, SI 2018/1103, which implemented the governance provisions; (ii) the Occupational Pension Schemes (Cross-border Activities) (Amendment) Regulations 2018, SI 2018/1102, which implemented the requirements relating to cross-border activity and cross-border transfers; and (iii) the Pension Protection Fund (Pensionable Service) and Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment and Disclosure) (Amendment and Modification) Regulations 2018, SI 2018/988, which (among other things) made amendments to the content requirements of statements of investment principles so as to require trustees to state, from 1 October 2019, their policy on \u2018financially material considerations\u2019. The UK government considered that the other aspects of IORP Directive II were already adequately covered by the existing UK law. Given that IORP Directive II has already been implemented in UK law, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 has preserved any legislation made in the UK to implement the obligations under IORP Directive II (including those carried over from the original IORP Directive). That legislation has not changed immediately following Brexit, although there will be scope later on for the UK legislation and regulation to diverge from that of the EU.\nThe insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks, and if the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, if we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our recorded liabilities, if our insurance premiums increase or if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered.\nWe may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. Additionally, our worker\u2019s compensation, auto and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self-insured retentions. We develop bi-yearly and record quarterly an estimate of our projected insurance-related liabilities. We estimate the liabilities associated with the risks retained by us, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessments, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, in the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost. Any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions, and such acquisitions could result in unknown liabilities, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and require significant management resources.\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or products. However, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition candidates, we may be unable to complete or finance such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, service or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results. Future acquisitions could also require us to incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or amortize expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. Finally, acquisitions may be structured in such a manner that would result in the assumption of unknown liabilities not disclosed by the seller or uncovered during pre-acquisition due diligence.\nWe may divest of certain of our brands or businesses from time to time, which could adversely affect us.\nWe evaluate our business regularly and, from time to time, we may decide to divest ourselves of brands or businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to divest of a brand or business on favorable terms or without significant costs or that we will be able to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. Any such divestitures may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, security systems, suppliers and customers, which could materially and adversely affect our net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001, have contributed to economic instability in the United States and in certain other countries, and further acts of terrorism, bioterrorism, cyberterrorism, violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate, our business operations, our expectations and other forward-looking statements contained in this report. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the U.S. and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, North Korea and Ukraine, may cause economic and political uncertainties and cause our business to suffer in ways that cannot currently be predicted. Events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in investment valuations. In addition, terrorist attacks, particularly acts of bioterrorism, that directly impact our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers could have an impact on our sales, supply chain, production capability and costs and our ability to deliver our finished products.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe maintain valuable patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property, and consider our intellectual property to be of material value. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing\ntechnologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. Any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, with no assurance of success.\nOur products, processes, methods, and equipment may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our management. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products and thereby materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare reform legislation in the United States and its implementing regulations could impact the healthcare benefits we are required to provide our employees in the United States and cause our compensation costs to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), was signed into law in the United States. This healthcare reform legislation and its applicable implementing regulations contain provisions that could materially impact our future healthcare costs, including the contributions we are required to make to our benefit plans. In particular, the requirement that we either offer our full-time employees healthcare coverage that satisfies the ACA's affordability and minimum value standards or potentially be subject to an excise tax penalty became effective in calendar year 2015. In addition, beginning in 2016, we had to file information returns with the IRS regarding the health insurance coverage offered to our full-time employees in the prior calendar year and furnish to employees a statement that includes the same information provided to the IRS. While we have timely filed such returns and provided our employees with the required statements to date, failure to do so in the future could expose us to reporting penalties under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code. These provisions could reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nLegislative changes to, or regulatory changes under, all or certain portions of the ACA have been made under the Trump administration and more may be likely. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed Public Law 116-94, a spending bill that included provisions repealing the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share. President Trump also signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, members of the U.S. Congress have proposed other legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, in addition to Public Law 116-94, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d (although a few states have adopted individual mandate requirements that assess penalties against individuals based on their uninsured status). There is uncertainty with respect to the impact that the reform proposals from the President\u2019s administration and U.S. Congress may have, if any, including whether additional legislative reform will be enacted and whether any proposals will encompass or potentially alter the full-time employee healthcare coverage requirements and reporting obligations imposed on large employers like us. There have also been various litigation challenges to the ACA, some of which are ongoing. The 2020 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections may also result in unknown changes to healthcare laws. Any changes may likely take time to unfold, and we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on us. We cannot assure that the ACA, as currently enacted or as repealed or amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nWe may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility.\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. The closure or divestiture of all or\npart of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom mandating its withdrawal from the EU could have an adverse effect on our business, investments and future operations in Europe.\nThe vote on June 23, 2016 by the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) to exit the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d), created uncertainty in the global financial markets. In December 2020, the EU and the UK reached an agreement on the future relationship between the two markets (the \u201cEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d). The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will affect Darling Ingredients International\u2019s business in Europe with respect to goods and employees. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement applied since January 1, 2021 and entails, inter alia, that customs checks and controls apply to all UK exports entering the EU as well as EU exports entering the UK. Based on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK is considered a third country when it comes to imports in the EU. As a result, imports of products that are derived from animal by-products into the EU from the UK must follow third country rules, including being accompanied by an export health certificate or model declaration form, and may be subject to veterinary checks and having to enter through designated board inspection posts. This may delay imports/exports between the EU and the UK and may entail additional costs. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement may also impair the ability of Darling Ingredients International to transact business in the future in the UK, including by restricting the free travel of employees as UK citizens will no longer have the freedom to live in the EU, and will need visas to work in the EU, other than short-term visits for specific purposes (e.g. attending meetings, conducting training) in accordance with local immigration laws. The same restrictions will apply to EU citizens in the UK. Moreover, there will continue to be some legal uncertainty for a while and the laws applicable in the EU and UK will start to diverge as the UK adopts its own legislation. Furthermore, Brexit is likely to continue to adversely affect European and worldwide economic conditions and could contribute to greater instability in the global financial markets for a while to come. These effects could have an adverse effect on our business, investments and future operations in Europe.", "PERMNO": 80928, "SIC": 2070, "TIC": "DAR"}
