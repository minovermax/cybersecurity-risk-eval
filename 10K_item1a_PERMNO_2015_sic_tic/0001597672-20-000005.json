When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nThe businesses we operate are highly competitive and many of them are cyclical, which may result in fluctuations in pricing and volume that can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition, demand fluctuations and cyclicality are the most significant drivers of sales volumes and pricing for our products. We face significant competition from domestic and foreign producers in virtually all of our businesses. For example, in our cellulose specialties product line, increased cellulose specialties production capacity from our competitors, some of whom have lower raw material, wood and production costs than us, combined with demand weakness, particularly in the acetate and viscose grades, have collectively contributed to substantially lower cellulose specialties sales prices over the past several years. Likewise, volumes have declined meaningfully over the past two years due to these factors. Our high-purity commodity products for viscose and absorbent materials applications are also highly cyclical, and in 2019 were at extremely low levels. There can be no assurance these declines will not continue into the near future.\nWith respect to demand for cellulose specialties, and in particular our acetate grades, the majority of these acetate grades are used to manufacture acetate tow, which is used to make the filter component of a cigarette. Significant increases in cigarette costs and potential actions taken by the United States and other countries to discourage smoking, such as tax increases on tobacco products, policy changes and future legislation, may have a material adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products. For example, actions by the Chinese government to curb corruption and limit smoking in public buildings have had some impact on cigarette consumption. Additionally, increased use of e-cigarettes, electronically heated tobacco products and smokeless tobacco products, by way of example, may affect demand for traditional cigarettes.\nIn addition, some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as construction, home building, publishing, packaging, automotive and textiles, are cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us which are beyond our control. These industries are highly competitive and may experience overcapacity and reductions in end use demand, each of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. The consequences of this could include the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders.\nOur lumber, paper, high yield pulp and paper-related commodity businesses are highly cyclical and influenced by a variety of factors. These include periods of excess product supply due to industry capacity increases, periods of decreased demand due to reduced economic activity or market conditions, inventory de-stocking by customers and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These factors may cause significant price changes over a short period, as we saw in the second half of 2018 and continuing into 2019, in our lumber business. To address these factors, we have in the past, and may in the future, elect to schedule production curtailments and shutdowns to address, for example, unfavorable economic conditions, reduced demand for our products or the end products of our customers, lack of economically viable fiber in Canada, reduced market prices and other factors. In particular, our lumber, newsprint and high yield pulp businesses have been the subject of curtailments and shutdowns in 2019 in reaction to market conditions.\nIn sum, continued competitive pressures and demand weakness, as well as the cyclicality of our commodity businesses, may have a material impact on our future sales prices and volumes and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ten largest customers represent approximately 33 percent of our 2019 revenue, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenue from these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we are not dependent on any single customer or group of customers, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 33 percent of revenue in 2019. Due to the highly competitive nature of our businesses, we regularly bid for new business and to retain/renew existing business and, as such, we are subject to the potential for meaningful revenue and volume gains and losses.\nWe are also subject to credit risk associated with these customers. If one or more of our ten largest customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for its products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we continue to strive to broaden and diversify our customer base, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from these ten customers, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any of these customers, or significant, unfavorable changes to pricing or terms contained in contracts with them, could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 21 - Segment and Geographical Information of our consolidated financial statements for more information on our major customers.\nA material disruption at one of our major manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and profitability, increase our cost of production and capital needs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAny of our major manufacturing facilities, or a significant portion of any of these facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly or suffer a material disruption to all or a portion of its operations due to a number of adverse events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled outages or downtime due to the need for unexpected maintenance or equipment failure, such as for portions of our facilities that produce steam and electricity (such as boilers and turbines), pollution control equipment, and equipment directly used to manufacture our products, such as the reliability issues during the first quarter of 2019 at the Temiscaming, Quebec plant;\n\u2022\nprolonged power interruptions or failures;\n\u2022\nexplosion of boilers or other pressure vessels;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in the supply of raw materials, including chemicals and wood fiber;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to or failures of the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels, as well as lack of availability of rail, trucking and ocean shipping equipment and service from third party transportation providers;\n\u2022\ninterruption or material reduction of water supply;\n\u2022\na chemical spill or release or other event causing risks to the environment or human health and safety;\n\u2022\ninformation technology system failures and cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other similar catastrophes, such as the hurricanes which impacted our Jesup, Georgia and Fernandina Beach, Florida plants in 2017;\n\u2022\nlabor interruptions, such as the strike at our Temiscaming, Quebec facility in 2014 and short duration walk-outs in 2019 at our site in Tartas, France;\n\u2022\nterrorism or threats of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nother operational problems resulting from these and other risks.\nSome of these matters are discussed in more detail in other sections of this Item 1A - Risk Factors. Depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption, the event could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in raw material and energy availability and prices could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRaw material costs and energy, such as chemicals, oil and natural gas and electricity are a significant operating expense. The cost of these inputs can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as lack of availability, changing economic and weather conditions, political or other unrest or instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key manufacturing input in our high purity cellulose business, has historically had significant price volatility. Similarly, the price of oil and natural gas (including its pipeline transportation element) is subject to fluctuations based on market and other factors. In contracts for certain of our products, pricing\nis set annually or otherwise not subject to change for a contractually-agreed period of time, so in some cases we may have limited ability to pass along fluctuations in these input costs once the contract price for the relevant period has been established. In addition, industrial and other policies of the governments and governmental agencies having jurisdiction over our facilities may change, due to changes in political leadership or otherwise, which also could adversely impact the cost of energy and its transportation. While we often use various strategies to mitigate the potential impact of this pricing volatility, such as long term contracting and the purchase of derivative commodity contracts, the impact of raw material and energy pricing increases could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe availability of, and prices for, wood fiber may significantly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWood fiber is the single largest raw material in the manufacturing process for virtually all of our products. Many factors can impact its availability and pricing: One key factor is whether the land on which the timber is grown is owned by private parties or governmental entities. For example, fiber for our U.S. and French facilities is primarily harvested from privately-held lands, while fiber for our Canadian facilities is primarily harvested from lands owned or controlled by the governments of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, referred to as \u201cCrown lands\u201d. In 2019, approximately 90 percent of the Company\u2019s fiber requirements in Canada were sourced from Crown lands. The Company\u2019s current agreements with provincial authorities grant timber \u201ctenures\u201d for terms varying from five to 20 years and may be subject to renewals every five years. In Canada, the Company currently manages approximately 25 million acres (ten million hectares) of Crown lands for timber production. The price and availability of this Canadian fiber depends, in large part, on the Company\u2019s ability to replace or renew these agreements on acceptable terms or enter into acceptable alternative fiber supply arrangements with provincial authorities. The terms of any replacement, renewal or alternative arrangement are based on legislative and regulatory provisions as well as governmental policy. Therefore, changes in legislation, regulatory regimes or policy in the provinces in which we operate may reduce the availability of fiber and increase costs through the imposition of additional and more stringent harvesting, rehabilitation and silvicultural standards or the alteration of fee structures. Although we expect these agreements to be extended in the ordinary course as they come up for renewal, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed, extended or replaced in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the amount of timber that the Company is permitted to harvest will not decrease.\nAlso, Aboriginal communities in Canada, often referred to as \u201cFirst Nations\u201d, have Aboriginal or treaty rights on most timberlands in Canada. Canadian courts have recognized that Aboriginal people may possess rights in respect of land used or occupied by their ancestors and have encouraged the federal and provincial governments and Aboriginal people to resolve rights claims through the negotiation of treaties. We operate in territories in which a spectrum of non-treaty and treaty rights exist. To mitigate risks and accommodate the traditional activities of these communities during forestry planning and operations, the Company has concluded agreements, and is currently negotiating other agreements, with many First Nations communities to achieve Aboriginal community acceptance for our forestry operations plans. These agreements support an approach of active engagement with Aboriginal communities that serves to ensure the identification of issues and facilitates constructive problem-solving.\nRegulatory developments and environmental litigation also have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest from non-Crown lands in Canada and privately-owned lands in the U.S. and France, thereby increasing prices for these sources of wood fiber. In Canada, for example, future legislation and policy changes, litigation advanced by environmental groups and Aboriginal communities concerning rights and limitations on harvesting and use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest diversity, control over insect and disease infestations, and the response to and prevention of wildfires could also affect wood fiber supply, pricing and availability.\nIn addition, much of the wood fiber we use is sourced by or from third party contractors who harvest, chip and/or truck the fiber to our manufacturing facilities, either as logs for lumber and chipping, or as chips directly to our manufacturing facilities. Another key factor in fiber supply and pricing is the availability of experienced logging and fiber transportation contractors in the areas in which our manufacturing facilities are located. Moreover, to the extent that fiber must be sourced from greater distances from our facilities due to unavailability of more proximate fiber, this could also impact pricing due to additional transportation cost. Significant reduction in the availability of experienced contractors could also impact wood fiber supply, pricing and availability.\nFinally, natural conditions, such as weather, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access to timberlands for harvesting (for example, due to prolonged wet or cold conditions) may also limit the availability, and increase the price, of wood, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes. For example, during the past two years we have seen more frequent wet weather in the Southeastern U.S. region from which we source our fiber, which can result in reduced availability of supply and higher prices, especially for hardwoods. It is unclear whether these conditions will persist into the future.\nIn sum, any sustained decrease in harvestable lands or wood supply, or increase in fiber prices, whether sourced from Crown lands in Canada or from private parties in Canada, the U.S. or France, or changes in the logging and transportation supply base, or significant changes to historically customary natural conditions, could materially increase our costs and thereby materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nWe have significant manufacturing facilities in Canada and France, and a significant portion of our sales are to customers and customer locations outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the European Union and other international markets. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 61 percent of our revenue in 2019. The manufacture and sale of our products in non-U.S. markets results in risks that are inherent in conducting business under international laws, regulations and customs. We expect international sales will continue to contribute significantly to our financial condition and future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the United States include:\n\u2022\nmaintaining and governing international subsidiaries and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with, changes in and reinterpretations of, the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which we manufacture and sell our products;\n\u2022\nresponsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntrade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements, as discussed below in more detail;\n\u2022\nrepatriating cash from foreign countries to the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and their interpretations in the countries in which we do business, including the potential impact on the value of recorded or future deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nproduct damage or losses incurred during shipping;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022\neconomic instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, as discussed below in more detail;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures; and\n\u2022\nminimal or limited protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nThese and other risks of doing business outside of the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital.\nWe operate capital intensive businesses and require substantial capital for ongoing maintenance, repair and replacement of existing facilities and equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment and systems, some of which are large in scale, may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. Moreover, some of the facilities we acquired as part of the Tembec acquisition in 2017 have deferred capital expenditures due to Tembec\u2019s cash flows limitations in recent years, which may require the Company to make additional investments. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new or existing environmental regulations at times require additional capital expenditures for compliance. We believe our capital resources are currently adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. However, if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on reasonable economic terms, we could experience an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrency fluctuations may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada and France. The Company also sells its products all over the world, in either U.S dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, and its earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar and in the value of the Canadian dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. For example, a strengthening U.S. dollar or a weakening home currency of the countries in which certain of our international competitors manufacture products can adversely impact the Company\u2019s competitive position versus these competitors. In addition to ordinary course currency fluctuations, specific events such as Brexit have had, and could in the future have, impact on currency valuation. The Company\u2019s risk management policy allows management, with oversight from the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To accomplish this, the Company has used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative instruments, such as\ncurrency options and foreign exchange forward contracts, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations or that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on trade through tariffs, countervailing and anti-dumping duties, quotas and other trade barriers, in the United States and internationally, could adversely affect our ability to access certain markets.\nWe manufacture our products in the United States, Canada and France, and sell them into more than 40 countries. Our financial results are highly dependent on our ability to sell our products globally. Trade barriers such as tariffs, countervailing and dumping duties, quotas and similar restrictions on trade have in the past, and could in the future, result in materially reduced revenues and profitability. Examples of the effects of such restrictions on trade and tariffs on our business in China, Canada and as a result of \u201cBrexit\u201d are set forth below.\nChina\nIn 2019, the Company had total sales of $328 million of products shipped to customers in China and, of this amount, $229 million were of products manufactured in the United States. The continuing uncertainty, volatility and trade tensions, tariffs and negotiations between China and the U.S. have impacted our business in China and could do so in the future. On September 24, 2018, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, China announced a five percent tariff on approximately $60 billion in U.S. products exported to China, which includes all wood pulp sold by the Company from the U.S. into China. There is also the potential for additional retaliation in response to the U.S. tariffs, which could take the form of additional tariffs on U.S. products exported by the Company into China, or other actions such as quotas or other limitations on Chinese purchases from U.S.-based companies, including the Company. Failure of the U.S. and Chinese governments to reach acceptable agreements regarding trade, as well as continued trade volatility and additional trade-related actions by the Chinese government, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCanada\nThe Company operates six softwood lumber mills in Ontario and Quebec, Canada and, in 2019, sold approximately $160 million of softwood lumber into the United States from Canada. The United States and Canada have a history dating to the early 1980s of trade disputes relating to the export of softwood lumber from Canada into the United States. Each dispute has been resolved via agreement or litigation, which generally involved some combination of duties and/or quotas as well as a return of all or most of the duties previously paid by Canadian softwood lumber producers. In October of 2015, a ten-year Softwood Lumber Agreement (the \u201cSLA\u201d) between the United States and Canada, which resolved the 2001-2006 lumber dispute between the countries, expired. No agreement was reached to extend or renew it, and as a result, after a one-year cooling off period the United States commenced a dumping investigation of lumber exports from Canada into the U.S. In 2017, anti-dumping and countervailing duties were assessed by the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) on lumber exported into the United States, with the Company being assigned an anti-dumping duty rate of 6 percent and a countervailing duty rate of 14 percent. These duties are being legally challenged by Canada under both the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) dispute resolution processes. The Company has paid approximately $59 million in lumber duties to date, but expects to eventually receive most of these duties back in the event of a favorable ruling under the NAFTA or WTO process or a settlement of the dispute. No assurances can be given that the duties will be overturned or repaid through the legal process or a negotiated settlement, or that lumber pricing will be sufficient to substantially offset their impact.\n\u201cBrexit\u201d\nThe Company does not currently operate any manufacturing facilities, have any significant sales to customers, or have any major supply chain relationships, in Great Britain. As such, with respect to the exit of Great Britain from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the Company does not expect Brexit to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations. However, the Company does have manufacturing facilities in the EU (in France) and in 2019 had $268 million of sales to customers in the EU, so to the extent that Brexit impacts the EU\u2019s economy generally, specific regions of the EU or specific companies located in the EU, no assurances can be given that such events would not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally. We rely on these providers for transportation of the products we manufacture as well as delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities. A significant portion of the products we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, and internationally by ship.\nIf any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture in a timely manner, or damaged them during transport, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, the cost of energy, and specifically fuel, may adversely impact the cost of transporting our products. Finally, if any of the ports we commonly use for international shipping, or the port system generally, were to suffer work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, we could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental laws, regulations and permits that may restrict or adversely affect how we conduct business and our financial results.\nOur plants are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that may cause us to incur significant capital to enable compliance, or which could limit operations and production. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that contain conditions governing how we operate our facilities including how much and, in some cases, what types of products we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production, limit our ability to increase production and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, compliance-related capital and operating costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.\nEnvironmental laws, regulations and permits are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations, permits and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These laws and regulations may limit, prohibit or affect, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater, and the type of chemicals we use in our manufacturing processes. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Environmental regulatory authorities have pursued a number of initiatives which, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like ours, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and storm water control. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation for further information. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental groups, Aboriginal communities (in Canada) and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups, Aboriginal communities and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in areas where we operate plants and manage and operate timberlands. External engagement with these groups and communities is a requirement of our licenses to manage and operate timberlands in Quebec and Ontario. Consultation with indigenous communities may also be required during the environmental permitting process for renewal of existing permits and expansions or modifications of our manufacturing operations in these provinces. Delays, restrictions and increased cost caused by the intervention of these groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. For example, in March 2014, litigation was commenced in federal court by the Altamaha Riverkeeper (\u201cARK\u201d) alleging violations of federal and state environmental laws relating to permitted wastewater discharges from our Jesup plant (although it was dismissed by the court on summary judgment in 2015), and in January of 2016 the same group brought an action in the Georgia Office of Administrative Hearings against the Georgia Environmental Protection Division of the Natural Resources (\u201cEPD\u201d) in opposition to the issuance by EPD of a renewed wastewater treatment permit for our Jesup plant. While these proceedings have been decided, to date, largely in the Company\u2019s favor, we expect continuing attempts at legal intervention by ARK and others. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for a description of the pending legal proceedings with ARK.\nWe currently own or may acquire properties that require environmental remediation or otherwise are subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, may have liability at formerly operated manufacturing facilities that we do not currently own, and may acquire additional facilities in the future, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other liabilities. The cost of assessment and remediation of contaminated properties could be substantial and adversely affect financial results. These costs could include, without limitation, costs of investigation and assessment, corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment and other remediation and closure costs, as well as third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of alleged violations of, or liabilities arising out of, environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe we currently have adequate liabilities recorded, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of contaminated properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance actual expenditures will not exceed current liabilities and forecasts, or that other presently unknown liabilities will not be discovered\nin the future. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation and Note 11 - Environmental Liabilities.\nThe potential longer-term impacts of climate-related risks remain uncertain at this time.\nIn 2019, focus and attention to climate-related risks and opportunities continued to increase in importance to our customers, investors and other stakeholders. Certain investors have expressed a desire for issuers to improve their climate-related disclosures and have advocated for use of a disclosure framework created by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). While the Company is endeavoring to model, quantify and disclose climate-related risks similarly to the TCFD requirements, it has also made meaningful information available on its Company website and expects to develop specific climate-related disclosures in alignment with the TCFD requirements over the 12-18 months. At this time, the Company does not expect climate-related issues to have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations in the near term.\nThe Company considers and evaluates climate-related risks in three general categories; Regulatory, Transition to a low-carbon economy, and Physical risks related to climate-change.\nRegulatory. There are numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the United States, Canada and France, where the Company has operations, most of these initiatives and proposals would or currently regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (GHGs) to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more \u201cclean energy.\u201d Initiatives that could materially impact purchased electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs, especially in our Canadian operations, because our operations in Canada use more purchased electricity (on a percentage basis) than those in our U.S. facilities, which generate most of their own electricity needs. In addition, the federal government of Canada has indicated its intent to regulate priority air pollutants and GHGs under the Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Under the proposed targets, the Company\u2019s Canadian pulp and paper mills may be required to reduce air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and GHGs. While industry consultations are ongoing with the federal government, the cost of making any such reductions is currently unknown; however, the requirements associated with PM, SOx and NOx are not expected to be material to the Company given its current operations and pollution control systems.\nUnder the provisions of the Canadian federal programs, which permit the provinces to implement their own GHG reduction programs in lieu of the federal ones, both Ontario and Quebec have implemented \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs for GHGs and, at this time, only the Company\u2019s Temiscaming site in Qu\u00e9bec was a net purchaser of credits under these programs in 2019. However, in July of 2018, the then-newly elected provincial government in Ontario terminated Ontario\u2019s cap and trade program, which as a result subjected the province to the federal Canadian requirements. To date, the cost of GHG credits under cap and trade programs purchased by our business and incorporated into the overall cost of our purchased wood fiber has not been material, though no assurances can be given that they will not substantially increase in the future, and especially in Canada after 2022 (when the current programs expire) because the future state of the law and cost of GHG credits after such date is currently not known.\nTransition. The transition to a low carbon economy, as predicted by many investors and other stakeholders, poses both risks and opportunities for the Company that are, as yet, not quantified. Similar to other manufacturers in our sector, we use biomass, natural gas, liquid fossil fuels and purchased electricity to power our plants. Changes in policy, regulation or technology related to fuels that we use, or our electricity providers use, could increase our costs.\nAt the same time our main product lines (cellulose specialties and viscose grade commodity dissolving wood pulps) as well as all of our other products, are made from wood as their primary raw material, which is a renewable, natural raw material. In addition, our cellulose specialty products are natural polymers that potentially can be used as an effective, more climate-friendly substitute for certain applications which currently use fossil fuel-based products. However, these opportunities, as well as their attendant risks, are not fully known or understood at this time.\nPhysical. The potential impacts of extreme weather which could result from the impacts of climate change, such as hurricanes, blizzards, and heavy rain, are factored into our enterprise risk assessment process and the mitigation measures we currently take to protect our assets and business. It is not clear whether increased frequency of these or similar events would materially change our risk profile, analyses or mitigation measures, but there can be no assurance that they would not require additional expenditures which could be material.\nIn sum, additional business and regulatory initiatives may be implemented to address GHG emissions and other climate-change-related concerns. If such initiatives are implemented, we may be required to incur additional capital expenditures, increased operating costs for wood fiber or raw materials, and/or mitigating expenses, such as carbon taxes or other charges, to address and\ncomply with any such initiatives. No assurance can be given that the increased costs associated with compliance of future GHG-related requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 74 percent of our global work force is unionized. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms of employment with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations resulted in substantially higher compensation costs or materially restricted how we run our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. While we do not expect any labor interruptions of significant duration, if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage at one or more of our major facilities, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in the loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. Furthermore, some of our facilities are in relatively remote locations, which can adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees. Our failure to retain these key personnel and recruit qualified replacements for retiring employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to develop new products or discover new applications for our existing products, or our inability to protect the intellectual property underlying such new products or applications, could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have an active research and development program to develop new products and new applications for our existing products. However, there can be no assurance this program will be successful, either from a product development or commercialization perspective, or that any particular invention, product or development, or the program as a whole, will lead to significant revenue or profit generation. Moreover, some of our new products and new applications may not contain intellectual property that can be protected under applicable law. Failure to generate meaningful revenue and profit from our research and product development efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nThe risk of loss of the Company\u2019s intellectual property and sensitive business information, or disruption of its manufacturing operations, in each case due to cyberattacks or cybersecurity breaches, could adversely impact the Company.\nLike most companies, the Company has been, and expects in the future to continue to be, subject to attempted cyberattacks. Cyberattacks or cybersecurity breaches could compromise the Company\u2019s intellectual property and confidential business information, cause a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, or harm the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company\u2019s information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient operation of its business. This role includes ordering and managing equipment, parts and raw materials from suppliers, managing inventory, managing the processes we use to produce finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment and processing of transactions, summarizing and reporting financial results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, retaining certain personal information and providing other processes necessary to manage our business. While the Company has implemented and maintains what it believes to be appropriate cybersecurity policies, programs, controls and systems, there can be no assurance a cyberattack would not be successful, or that such a cybersecurity breach will not occur. Such an event could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to make significant additional cash contributions to our retirement benefit plans if investment returns on pension assets are lower than expected or interest rates decline, and/or due to changes to regulatory, accounting and actuarial requirements.\nWe have a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers many of our salaried and hourly employees in the United States. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. Our non-U.S. pension plans, while currently adequately funded, will also require periodic contributions to ensure that applicable legal requirements are met. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. In addition, it is possible new or additional accounting rules and changes to actuarial requirements (for example, if life expectancy assumptions for participants are increased) may also result in the need for additional contributions to the plans. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status.\nDebt-Related Risks\nWhile the Company has entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to its Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as amended by the Amendment, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) to address the risk of potential non-compliance with certain covenants at the end of the third quarter of 2019, there can be no assurances that the Company will continue in full compliance with the amended covenants provided in the Credit Amendment through December 31, 2021, which is the date covenant relief granted under the Amendment expires.\nCash flows from operations, primarily driven by operating results, have historically been our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Primarily as a result of significant decreases over the past 18 months in the market prices for our commodity products, and specifically viscose and fluff pulps, high-yield pulp, lumber, paperboard and newsprint, our financial results have materially declined requiring us to amend the financial covenants and other provisions of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. On September 30, 2019, the Company entered into an Amendment of its Senior Secured Credit Facilities reducing the restrictions of its first lien secured net leverage ratio and the interest coverage ratio tests through the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company is in compliance with the financial covenants and other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended, as of December 31, 2019, although there can be no assurance given of future compliance or that additional amendments to the credit facilities will not be necessary.\nWe have debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total combined indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion. This significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments on this debt;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nreducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, market or other changes in our businesses and industry;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nTo the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark in 2021 may impact our borrowing costs.\nThe reporting of financial information used to determine LIBOR is scheduled to cease in 2021. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $499 million in term loan indebtedness with interest payment terms based on LIBOR, which matures in either 2022 or 2024, as applicable, after the phase-out of LIBOR. Under the terms of these loans, if LIBOR is no longer calculated, interest on the loans would be determined by using a comparable or successor widely-published alternative rate designated by the administrative agent. We have not yet been advised by the administrative agent of its selected alternative rate. While we do not believe that a change from LIBOR to an alternative rate will have a material impact on our borrowing costs or ability to access capital, no assurances relating to the potential impact can be provided at this time.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environments may materially adversely affect our future access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or equity or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be materially adversely affected if there continues to be a material decline in the pricing or sales volume for our products, or if significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing or other costs of capital or affect our ability to gain access to the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities, make strategic investments in our facilities or require funding to invest in joint ventures or make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital and/or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, the terms of such debt may subject us to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants in addition to those that are expected to be in place pursuant to our existing indebtedness.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock and Certain Corporate Matters\nYour percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have options to purchase shares of our common stock and we anticipate our compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to our employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, could prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. In particular, note that, on August 10, 2016, the Company issued 1,725,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), as more fully described in that certain Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-209747) and Prospectus filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, as amended by that certain Prospectus Supplement dated August 4, 2016 (the \u201cProspectus Supplement\u201d). As a result of this offering, each share of the Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of common stock on August 15, 2019. The number of shares of common stock issued at conversion was determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock over the 20-trading day period immediately prior to the mandatory conversion date (\u201cApplicable Market Value\u201d). The Applicable Market Value for our common stock was less than $12.91, resulting in a conversion rate per share of 7.7459, resulting in approximately 13.4 million shares of common stock being issued on August 15, 2019.
