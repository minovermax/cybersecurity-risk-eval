{"cik": "1099160", "company": "BEASLEY BROADCAST GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nOur Form 10-K disclosure and analysis concerning our operations, cash flows and financial position, including, in particular, the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or that include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Although these statements are based upon assumptions we consider reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described more fully below. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will achieve the results anticipated or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nThe radio broadcasting industry faces many unpredictable business risks and is sensitive to external economic forces that could have a material adverse effect on our advertising revenues and results of operations.\nOur future operations are subject to many business risks, including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nshifts in population, demographics or audience preferences;\n\u2022\nincreased competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations, broadcast and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, internet radio, satellite radio, smart phones, tablets, and other wireless media, the internet, social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and other forms of advertising; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Internal Revenue Service, United States Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission.\nIn addition, we believe that for most businesses advertising is a discretionary business expense, meaning that spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during an economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions as well as declining consumer confidence, recession and other factors could lead to decreased demand for advertising and negatively impact our advertising revenues and our results of operations. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or duration of any economic downturn generally, or in the markets in which our advertisers operate. If the economic environment does worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a decline in revenues, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues, which could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business. A decline in our audience share or advertising rates in a particular market may cause a decline in the revenue and cash flow of our stations located in that market. Our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations, as well as with other media outlets. These other media outlets include broadcast and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, internet radio, satellite radio, smart phones, tablets, and other wireless media, the internet, social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and other forms of advertising.\nOur radio stations could suffer a reduction in audience ratings or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses if:\n\u2022\nanother radio station in a market was to convert its programming to a format similar to, and thereby compete more directly with, one of our radio stations; or\n\u2022\na new radio station was to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to improve its audience share.\n\u2022\na current or new advertising alternative increased its share of local and national advertising revenue.\nOther radio broadcasting companies may enter into markets in which we operate or may operate in the future. These companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have. Our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues.\nWe may not remain competitive if we do not respond to changes in technology, standards and services that affect our industry.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of other media technologies and services. We may not have the resources to acquire and deploy other technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these other technologies. Competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry or on our Company. Various other audio technologies and services that have been developed and introduced include:\n\u2022\npersonal digital audio devices (e.g. smart phones, tablets);\n\u2022\nsatellite delivered digital audio radio services that offer numerous programming channels and the sound quality of compact discs;\n\u2022\naudio programming by internet content providers, internet radio stations, cable systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, personal communications services and other digital audio broadcast formats;\n\u2022\nHD Radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services;\n\u2022\nlow power FM radio stations, which are non-commercial FM radio broadcast outlets that serve small, localized areas; and\n\u2022\nportable digital devices and systems that permit users to listen to programming on a time-delayed basis and to fast-forward through programming and/or advertisements.\nThese new technologies have the potential to change the means by which advertisers can reach target audiences most effectively. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our existing station portfolio with the stations acquired in the asset exchange with CBS Radio in a timely fashion or at all, and may encounter significant unexpected difficulties in achieving expected financial and operating synergies with our existing station portfolio.\nOn December 1, 2014, we completed the asset exchange with CBS Radio. Our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the asset exchange will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the newly acquired stations, which could be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, expenditure of resources and distraction of management and personnel. The difficulties of integrating the new radio stations could include:\n\u2022\nWe may devote significant resources to integration;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to achieve anticipated financial and operating synergies;\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulties integrating financial accounting systems, internal controls and standards, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulties integrating employee benefit plans;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to retain key personnel at the newly acquired stations; and\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulties integrating the corporate cultures and management philosophies of the new radio stations while assimilating employees.\nTherefore, there can be no assurance that the combination of our ongoing station portfolio with the stations acquired from CBS Radio will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the asset exchange.\nWe have substantial debt that could have important consequences to you.\nWe have debt that is substantial in relation to our stockholders\u2019 equity. As of December 31, 2014, we had long-term debt of $97.7 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $130.5 million. Our long-term debt is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes, including ongoing capital expenditures and future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to compete, expand and make capital improvements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns, limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions.\nOur ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and/or decreasing long-term debt will determine how much, if any, of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future. Poor financial results or\nunanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility. Any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our debt and the associated risks. In addition, there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available or on terms that will be acceptable to us.\nWe are subject to restrictive debt covenants, which may restrict our operational flexibility.\nOur credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, subject our assets to additional liens, enter into certain investments, consolidate, merge or effect asset sales, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, sell or discount accounts receivable, enter into transactions with our affiliates or stockholders, change the nature of our business, pay dividends on and redeem or repurchase capital stock, or make other restricted payments. These restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us.\nOur credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests. If our revenues were to decrease significantly it may become increasingly difficult for us to meet these financial covenants. In response we will continue to control costs and expenses in non-essential areas. Our breach of any of these covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under our credit facility. If an event of default exists under our credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness which could force us to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws and could significantly or entirely reduce the value of our equity.\nWe may also incur future debt obligations in addition to, or in lieu of, our credit facility. Such future debt obligations might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further limit our operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our structure, statutory restrictions and restrictions imposed by our credit agreement as well as any future agreements.\nWe intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend, however future payments, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Future quarterly dividend payments can also be changed or discontinued at any time and will be subject to limitations under the terms of any existing credit agreements. The payment and timing of any future quarterly dividends will also depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nWe are dependent on federally-issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our radio stations. Our business depends upon maintaining our broadcast licenses, which are issued by the FCC for a term of eight years and are renewable. Our timely-filed renewal application for WSFL-FM in the Greenville-New Bern-Jacksonville, NC market has not been granted by the FCC. Pursuant to FCC rules, our broadcast license for this station remains in effect pending processing by the FCC of the timely-filed renewal application. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, we cannot assure you that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full eight-year terms or will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate any future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest one or more radio stations. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, these FCC regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe FCC regulates FM translator stations as a secondary service, and in the event that an FM translator station causes actual interference to the signal of a radio or television station, FCC rules require the FM translator station to eliminate the interference and to suspend operations if the interference cannot be eliminated. If the FCC requires any FM translator station that we operate to modify its facilities to eliminate interference caused to another station or to cease broadcasting, it could materially impair the operations of the station that the FM translator rebroadcasts which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA future impairment of our FCC broadcasting licenses and/or goodwill could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our FCC broadcasting licenses and goodwill represented 77.0% of our total assets. We are required to test our FCC broadcasting licenses and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our FCC broadcasting licenses and goodwill might be impaired which may result in future impairment losses. For further discussion, see \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d of this report.\nOur corporate offices and several of our radio stations are located in Florida and other areas that could be affected by hurricanes.\nFlorida is susceptible to hurricanes and we have our corporate offices and 14 radio stations located there. These radio stations contributed 36.4% of our net revenue in 2014. Although the 2014 hurricane season did not have a material impact on our operations, our corporate offices and our radio stations located in Florida and along the east coast of the United States could be materially affected by hurricanes in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We carry property damage insurance on all of our properties and business interruption insurance on some of our properties, but there can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover all of our hurricane-related losses.\nThe failure or destruction of satellite systems and transmitter facilities that we depend upon to distribute our programming could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe use studios, satellite systems, transmitter facilities and the internet to originate and/or distribute our station programs and commercials. We rely on third-party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities. These third-party contracts and services include, but are not limited to, electrical power, satellite transponders, uplinks and downlinks and telecom circuits. Distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us, which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities. A disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters (accidental or environmental), various acts of terrorism, power outages, major telecom connectivity failures or satellite failures. Our ability to distribute programming to station audiences may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on-line. Furthermore, until third-party services resume, the inability to originate or distribute programming could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nVigorous enforcement of the FCC\u2019s indecency rules could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of 6am and 10pm. Broadcasters\u2019 risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is increased by the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s definition of indecent material, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC has expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered \u201cblasphemy,\u201d \u201cpersonally reviling epithets,\u201d \u201cprofanity\u201d and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance. As a result, in the event that we broadcast material falling within the expanded breadth of the FCC\u2019s regulation, we could be subject to license revocation, renewal or qualifications proceedings, which would put the licenses that we depend on for our operations in jeopardy. In 2007, the monetary penalties for broadcasting indecent programming increased substantially. Other legislative proposals have been keyed to the number of violations found by the FCC and would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material. Formerly, the maximum permitted fines for adjudicated violations of the FCC\u2019s indecency rules were $32,500 per instance and $300,000 for each continuing violation. The current maximum permitted fines are $325,000 per incident and $3,000,000 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. In a decision issued in June 2012, the Supreme Court did not find that the FCC\u2019s indecency standards were inconsistent with the First Amendment, which means the FCC may continue to enforce the standards. Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint, a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture.\nWe may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our radio stations\u2019 broadcast of indecent or obscene material. To the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected.\nProposed legislation could require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists.\nLegislation has previously been introduced in Congress that would require radio broadcasters to pay a royalty to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded songs. The legislation failed to pass but is expected to be reintroduced. Currently, we pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music, Inc. (\u201cBMI\u201d), the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\u201cASCAP\u201d) and SESAC, Inc. (\u201cSESAC\u201d). The proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to the record labels and artists. It is currently unknown what proposed legislation, if any, will become law, whether industry groups will enter into an agreement with respect to fees, and what significance this royalty would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThe FCC\u2019s Proposed Incentive Auctions may result in a loss of spectrum for broadcast stations and potentially adversely impact our ability to compete.\nIn February 2012, Congress passed legislation authorizing the FCC to conduct a reverse incentive auction in which licensees of television stations may voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage rights in exchange for a portion of the proceeds received from new licensees who successfully bid in a forward auction for the right to use the repurposed spectrum. The statute also authorizes the FCC to repack the spectrum now used by television broadcasters, subject to certain limitations, including the obligation to make all reasonable efforts to preserve the coverage area and population served by a television station. In May 2014, the FCC released an Order establishing general rules for the auctions. Several petitions for reconsideration of certain of the rules were filed and remain pending. In addition, the FCC has released rulemaking proposals seeking comment regarding specific rules and procedures that will apply to the incentive auctions. That rulemaking process remains ongoing. If successful, the incentive auction will make available more spectrum for use by wireless carriers, which may increase the competitive impact that wireless technologies pose to the radio broadcast industry. The FCC must complete the auction by September 30, 2022, and has announced that as of now it intends to conduct the auction during early 2016.\nAt this time we cannot predict the outcome of the incentive auctions and repacking of broadcast television spectrum, or the impact such items will have on our business.\nOur business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including George G. Beasley, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Beasley is 82 years old. We believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by Mr. Beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of Mr. Beasley\u2019s or other key executives\u2019 expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer controls Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. and members of his immediate family own a substantial equity interest in Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. Their interests may conflict with yours.\nGeorge G. Beasley is generally able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Without the approval of Mr. Beasley, we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices. Shares of Class B and Class A common stock that Mr. Beasley beneficially owns represent 61.5% of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock. Members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of Class B common stock. Mr. Beasley will be able to direct our management and policies, except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation, third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law.\nHistorically, we have entered into certain transactions with George G. Beasley, members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Related Party Transactions\u201d and Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements.\nFuture sales by George G. Beasley or members of his family of our Class A common stock could adversely affect its market price.\nGeorge G. Beasley and members of his family beneficially own the majority of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock, which is convertible to Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. The market for our Class A common stock could change substantially if George G. Beasley and members of his family convert their shares of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock and then sell large amounts of shares of Class A common stock in the public market. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future.\nThe difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our Company may adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nDue to his large holdings of our common stock, George G. Beasley controls the decision whether any change of control of the Company will occur. Moreover, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control could be beneficial to you. In addition, the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own, directly or by attribution, in a market. FCC approval for transfers of control of FCC licensees and assignments of FCC licenses are also required. Because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations, the trading price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected.\nThere may not be an active market for our Class A common stock, making it difficult for you to sell your stock.\nOur stock may not be actively traded in the future. An illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors. Our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons, including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations. This market volatility could depress the price of our Class A common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this were to occur, the market price of our Class A common stock could decrease, perhaps significantly.", "PERMNO": 87589, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "BBGI"}
