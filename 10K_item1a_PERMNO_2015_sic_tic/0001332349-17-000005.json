{"cik": "1332349", "company": "Brookdale Senior Living Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDue to the dependency of our revenues on private pay sources, events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our monthly resident fees or entrance fees (including downturns in the economy, housing market, consumer confidence or the equity markets and unemployment among resident family members) could cause our occupancy rates, revenues, results of operations and cash flow to decline.\nCosts to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our communities are located typically can afford to pay our monthly resident fees. Economic downturns, softness in the housing market, higher levels of unemployment among resident family members, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility and/or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees or entrance fees. If we are unable to retain and/or attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings, our occupancy rates, revenues, results of operations and cash flow could decline.\nThe inability of seniors to sell real estate may delay their moving into our communities, which could negatively impact our occupancy rates, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nDownturns in the housing markets, such as the one we experienced beginning in 2007, could adversely affect the ability (or perceived ability) of seniors to afford our entrance fees and resident fees as our customers frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of our fees. Specifically, if seniors have a difficult time selling their homes or their homes' values decrease, these difficulties could impact their ability to relocate into our communities or finance their stays at our communities with private resources. If national or local housing markets experience protracted volatility, our occupancy rates, revenues, results of operations and cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a portion of our revenues, and will be subject to changes in reimbursement levels, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a portion of our revenues, and we cannot assure you that reimbursement levels will not decrease in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Beginning October 1, 2011, we were impacted by a reduction in the reimbursement rates for Medicare skilled nursing patients and home health patients, as well as a negative change in the allowable method for delivering therapy services to skilled nursing patients (resulting in increased therapy labor expense). In addition, certain per person annual limits on Medicare reimbursement for therapy services became effective in 2006, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions are currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. If these exceptions are modified or not extended beyond that date, our revenues, results of operations and cash flow relating to our outpatient therapy services could be materially adversely impacted.\nEffective October 1, 2012, certain Medicare Part B therapy services exceeding a specified threshold are subject to a pre-payment manual medical review process. The review process has had an adverse effect on the provision and billing of services for patients and could negatively impact therapist productivity. These Medicare Part B therapy cap exception requirements, including the applicable pre-approval requirements, could also negatively impact the revenues, results of operations and cash flow relating to our outpatient therapy services business. Pursuant to the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which was signed by the President on April 16, 2015, the manual review process will be replaced with a new review program to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\nTo help fund the expansion of health care coverage to previously uninsured people, the Affordable Care Act outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursements for various health care providers, including home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities, as well as other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. Among other changes, the Affordable Care Act calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"rebase\" reimbursements for home health, which has resulted in a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in 2014 and is being phased-in over a four year period through 2017, and to establish productivity adjustments reducing the reimbursement rates that we would have otherwise received. For home health in 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") has implemented a net 0.7% reimbursement reduction, consisting of a 2.8% market basket inflation increase, less a 0.3% productivity reduction, a 2.3% rebasing adjustment, and a 0.9% reduction to account for industry wide case-mix growth. We expect the total effect of the changes for 2017 to reduce our reimbursement by approximately 3.2%.\nOn June 8, 2016, the CMS announced that it is implementing a 3-year Medicare pre-claim review demonstration for home health services in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. CMS began the pre-claim review demonstration in Illinois in August 2016, will begin the demonstration in Florida in April 2017, and is expected to announce in coming months staggered start dates for the other states. We derive a significant portion of our home health revenue from these states. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. The pre-claim review demonstration may result in an increase in administrative costs or reimbursement delays related to home health services in such states, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress will take on reimbursement policies of the Medicare program or what future rule changes the CMS will implement. Changes in the reimbursement policies of the Medicare program could have an adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe impact of ongoing health care reform efforts on our business cannot accurately be predicted.\nThe health care industry in the United States is subject to fundamental changes due to ongoing health care reform efforts and related political, economic and regulatory influences. Notably, the Affordable Care Act resulted in expanded health care coverage to millions of previously uninsured people beginning in 2014 and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. health care system. To help fund this expansion, the Affordable Care Act outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursements for various health care providers, including home health networks and skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. This comprehensive health care legislation has resulted and will continue to result in extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered, amended, repealed or replaced. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to the complexity of the law and implementing regulations, as well our inability to foresee how CMS and other participants in the health care industry will respond to the choices available to them under the law. We also cannot accurately predict whether any new or pending legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on our business. Similarly, while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect us and the manner in which we are reimbursed by the federal health care programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our business. The provisions of the legislation and other regulations implementing the provisions of the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation may increase our costs, decrease our revenues, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition to its impact on the delivery and payment for health care, the Affordable Care Act and the implementing regulations have resulted and may continue to result in increases to our costs to provide health care benefits to our employees. We also may be required to make additional employee-related changes to our business as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation impacting the provision of health insurance by employers, which could result in additional expense and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nOverbuilding and increased competition may adversely affect our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other companies that provide long-term care alternatives such as home healthcare agencies, therapy services, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing providers, including not-for-profit entities. In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and assisted living sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial. In addition, over the last several years there has been an increase in the construction of new senior housing assets, and beginning in the third quarter of 2016 we began experiencing an adverse change in the competitive environment for our consolidated senior housing portfolio, with significant new competition opening in a number of our markets. We expect this elevated rate of new openings to continue through most of fiscal 2017, and we expect that the senior living industry may become more competitive in the future. Such new competition that we have encountered or may encounter could limit our ability to attract new residents, raise or maintain resident fees or expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing or to extend or refinance debt as it matures, which could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nIn recent years, the United States stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing (including any refinancing or extension of our existing debt) on reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had three principal corporate-level debt obligations: our $400.0 million secured credit facility, our $316.3 million 2.75% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2018 and separate letter of credit facilities providing for up to $64.5 million of letters of credit in the aggregate. If we are unable to extend (or refinance, as applicable) any of our debt or credit or letter of credit facilities prior to their scheduled maturity dates, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to extend or refinance our other maturing debt or credit or letter of credit facilities, the terms of the new financing may not be as favorable to us as the terms of the existing financing.\nA prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital, including through the issuance of common stock. Disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on us and our business. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, we also may have to delay or abandon some or all of our portfolio optimization or growth initiatives, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nGeneral economic factors could adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business.\nGeneral economic conditions, such as inflation, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, interest rates, and tax rates, affect our facility operating, facility lease, general and administrative and other expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors. In addition, current global economic conditions and uncertainties, the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions, and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our business partners, landlords, counterparties and residents or prospective residents in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk that certain of our business partners, landlords or counterparties would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us, and other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and lease payments, this would result in defaults of the related debt or leases and cross-defaults under our other debt or lease documents, which would adversely affect our capital structure, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have significant indebtedness and lease obligations, and we intend to continue financing our communities through mortgage financing, long-term leases and other types of financing, including borrowings under our line of credit and future credit facilities we may obtain. We cannot give any assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest, principal and lease payments. Any non-payment or other default under our financing arrangements could, subject to cure provisions, cause the lender to foreclose upon the community or communities securing such indebtedness or, in the case of a lease, cause the lessor to terminate the lease, each with a consequent loss of revenue and asset value to us. Furthermore, in some cases, indebtedness is secured by both a mortgage on a community (or communities) and a guaranty by us and/or one or more of our subsidiaries. In the event of a default under one of these scenarios, the lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by declaring all amounts outstanding under the guaranty immediately due and payable, and requiring the respective guarantor to fulfill its obligations to make such payments. The realization of any of these scenarios would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and capital structure. Additionally, a foreclosure on any of our properties could cause us to recognize taxable income, even if we did not receive any cash proceeds in connection with such foreclosure. Further, because many of our outstanding debt and lease documents contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions, a default by us related to one community could affect a significant number of our communities and their corresponding financing arrangements and leases. In the event of such a default, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the lender or lessor on terms acceptable or favorable to us, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our capital structure and financial condition.\nOur indebtedness and long-term leases could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to operate our business.\nOur level of indebtedness and our long-term leases could adversely affect our future operations and/or impact our stockholders for several reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nWe may have little or no cash flow apart from cash flow that is dedicated to the payment of any interest, principal or amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness and lease payments with respect to our long-term leases;\n\u2022\nIncreases in our outstanding indebtedness, leverage and long-term leases will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure;\n\u2022\nIncreases in our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansions, repositionings, new developments, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to make lease payments on our leases depends upon our future cash flow performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business might not continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness or leases, sell selected assets, reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or delay or abandon desirable acquisitions. These measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases. The failure to make required payments on our debt or leases could result in an adverse effect on our future ability to generate revenues and our results of operations and cash flow. Any contemplated financing, refinancing, restructuring, or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms to us. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain extension options. If we are not able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising these extension options our liquidity and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nOur existing credit facilities, mortgage loans and lease arrangements contain covenants that limit or restrict our operations and activities (including our ability to borrow additional funds and engage in certain transactions without consent of the applicable lender or lessor), and any default under such facilities, loans or arrangements could result in the acceleration of indebtedness, termination of the leases or cross-defaults under our other debt or lease documents, any of which would negatively impact our liquidity and interfere with our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require us to maintain or satisfy specified financial ratios and coverage tests, including maintaining prescribed net worth levels, leverage ratios and debt service and lease coverage ratios on a consolidated basis, and on a community or communities basis based on the debt or lease securing the communities. In addition, certain of our leases require us to maintain lease coverage ratios on a lease portfolio basis (each as defined in the leases) and maintain stockholders' equity or tangible net worth amounts. The debt service coverage ratios are generally calculated as revenues less operating expenses, including an implied management fee and a reserve for capital expenditures, divided by the debt (principal and interest) or lease payment. Net worth is generally calculated as stockholders' equity as calculated in accordance with GAAP, and in certain circumstances, reduced by intangible assets or liabilities or increased by deferred gains from sale-leaseback transactions and deferred entrance fee revenue. These restrictions and covenants may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities, which may inhibit our ability to pursue our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, then the related indebtedness could become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we could pay this debt if it became due. In addition, certain of our outstanding indebtedness and leases limit or restrict, among other things, our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds, engage in a change in control transaction, dispose of all or substantially all of our or their assets, or engage in mergers or other business combinations without consent of the applicable lender or lessor.\nOur credit facilities, mortgage loans and leases are secured by our communities and, in certain cases, a guaranty by us and/or one or more of our subsidiaries. Therefore, an event of default under the outstanding indebtedness or leases, subject to cure provisions in certain instances, would give the respective lenders or lessors, as applicable, the right to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, terminate the lease, foreclose on collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness and leases, and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings under the outstanding indebtedness or continue to operate the properties subject to the lease. Many of our outstanding debt and lease documents contain cross-default provisions so that a default under one of these instruments would cause a default under other debt and lease documents.\nThe substantial majority of our lease arrangements are structured as master leases. Under a master lease, we may lease a large number of geographically dispersed properties through an indivisible lease. As a result, it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord. Failure to comply with Medicare or Medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of our master lease and debt financing instruments. In addition, an event of default related to an individual property or limited number of properties within a master lease portfolio would result in a default on the entire master lease portfolio and could further trigger cross-default provisions in other outstanding debt and lease documents. In the event of such a default, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the lessor on terms acceptable or favorable to us, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our capital structure, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, and could interfere with our ability to pursue our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives.\nCertain of our master leases and management agreements also contain radius restrictions, which limit our ability to own, develop or acquire new communities within a specified distance from certain existing communities covered by such agreements. These radius restrictions could negatively affect our ability to expand, develop or acquire senior housing communities and operating companies.\nMortgage debt and lease obligations expose us to increased risk of loss of property, which could harm our ability to generate future revenues and could have an adverse tax effect.\nMortgage debt and lease obligations increase our risk of loss because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties or pursuant to the terms of the lease may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders or lessors and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default or cause the lessor to terminate the lease. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow. Further, our mortgage debt and leases generally contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions and a default on one community could affect a significant number of our communities, financing arrangements and leases.\nIn addition, our leases generally provide for renewal or extension options and, in certain cases, purchase options. These options generally are based upon prescribed formulas but, in certain cases, may be at fair market value. We expect to renew, extend or exercise purchase options with respect to our leases in the normal course of business; however, there can be no assurance that these rights will be exercised in the future or that we will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal, extension or purchase options. Furthermore, the terms of any such options that are based on fair market value are inherently uncertain and could be unacceptable or unfavorable to us depending on the circumstances at the time of exercise. If we are not able to renew or extend our existing leases, or purchase the communities subject to such leases, at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms, or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us, our business, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in market interest rates could significantly increase the costs of our unhedged debt and lease obligations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur unhedged floating-rate debt and lease payment obligations and any unhedged floating-rate debt incurred in the future, exposes us to interest rate risk. Therefore, increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nIncreases in the cost and availability of labor, including increased competition for or a shortage of skilled personnel, increased wage pressures or increased union activity, would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain and attract skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our communities. Each community has an Executive Director responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the community, including quality of care, social services and financial performance. Depending upon the size of the community, each Executive Director is supported by a community staff member who is directly responsible for day-to-day care of the residents and either community staff or regional support to oversee the community's sales, marketing and community outreach programs. Other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services, therapy services, activities, housekeeping and engineering.\nWe compete with various health care service providers, including other senior living providers, in retaining and attracting qualified and skilled personnel. Increased competition for or a shortage of nurses, therapists or other trained personnel, or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience wage pressures due to minimum wage increases mandated by state and local laws and the increase to the salary thresholds for overtime exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which were adopted by the Department of Labor in May 2016. The changes to the thresholds for overtime exemptions were to be effective December 1, 2016, but were temporarily enjoined by a U.S. District Court prior to their implementation. It is unclear whether the changes adopted by the Department of Labor ultimately will become effective as adopted, amended, replaced or repealed. We may not be able to offset such added costs resulting from competitive, inflationary or regulatory pressures by increasing the rates we charge to our residents or our service charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow. Turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses, therapists or other trained personnel varies substantially from market to market. If we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations effectively, our overall operating results and cash flow could be harmed.\nIn addition, efforts by labor unions to unionize any of our community personnel could divert management attention, lead to increases in our labor costs and/or reduce our flexibility with respect to certain workplace rules. New election rules promulgated by the National Labor Relations Board went into effect in April 2015 and substantially changed - and expedited - the union election process, thereby limiting the time available for us to attempt to persuade employees to vote against representation. If we experience an increase in organizing activity, if onerous collective bargaining agreement terms are imposed upon us, or if we otherwise experience an increase in our staffing and labor costs, our results of operations and cash flow would be negatively affected.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our formation in June 2005. Given our history of losses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or maintain profitability in the future. If we do not effectively manage our cash flow and business operations going forward or otherwise achieve profitability, our stock price could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to execute on our plans to dispose of owned communities and restructure existing leases, we may not realize an increase in the quality and durability of our cash flow, the improvement of our liquidity or reductions of our debt and lease leverage.\nThrough our portfolio optimization initiative, we intend to dispose of owned and leased communities and restructure leases in order to simplify and streamline our business, to increase the quality and durability of our cash flow, to improve our liquidity and to reduce our debt and lease leverage.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had identified 16 communities as held for sale, and we continue to actively pursue the disposition of owned assets according to our disposition criteria, either through outright sales or contributions to ventures in which we would have an interest. The closings of such dispositions generally are subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you that such transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur. The sales price for pending or future dispositions may not meet our expectations due to the underlying performance of such communities or conditions beyond our control, and we may be required to take impairment charges in connection with such sales if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the proposed sales prices, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also plan to restructure existing leases, which may take the form of non-renewal of leases, negotiation of revised lease terms, termination of leases in favor of venture structures in which we would have an interest and, to a lesser degree, the purchase of the leased communities. As of December 31, 2016, transactions to terminate triple-net leases with respect to 90 communities leased from HCP, Inc. were pending, 64 of which affiliates of Blackstone have agreed to purchase and contribute to a venture in which we expect to acquire a non-controlling interest. The closings of such transactions generally are subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you that our pending or future transactions, including our pending transactions with HCP and affiliates of Blackstone, will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying and negotiating the restructuring of leases with counterparties on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may be required to pay significant amounts to restructure leases and we may be required to take charges in connection with restructuring of leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to execute on our plans to dispose of owned communities and restructure existing leases, we may not realize improvements to our liquidity, an increase in the quality and durability of our cash flow, and reductions to our debt and lease leverage. Such dispositions and lease restructurings likely will result in reductions to our revenue and may result in reductions to our results of operations and cash flow. Further, if we are unable to reduce our general and administrative expense with respect to completed dispositions and lease terminations in accordance with our expectations, we may not realize the expected benefits of such transactions, which could negatively impact our anticipated results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our operations and execute on our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives, and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nExecution on our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives, including our plans to continue expansion of our business through the expansion, renovation, redevelopment and repositioning of our existing communities, the development of new communities and the acquisition of operating companies, senior living communities and ancillary services companies will require additional capital, particularly if we were to accelerate our lease restructuring, development or acquisition plans. Financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable. In addition, certain of our outstanding indebtedness and long-term leases restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt. If we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain them on terms acceptable to us, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our plans to restructure leases and grow our business. Further, if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted. Any newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nWe are heavily dependent on mortgage financing provided by Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\") (collectively, the \"Agency Lenders\"). The Agency Lenders are currently operating under a conservatorship begun in 2008, conducting business under the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Reform efforts related to the Agency Lenders may make such financing sources less available or unavailable in the future and may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing. There can be no assurance that such alternative sources will be available.\nIf we are unable to expand, renovate, reposition or redevelop our communities in accordance with our plans, our anticipated revenues, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently working on projects that will expand, renovate, reposition or redevelop a number of our existing senior living communities. These projects are in various stages of development and are subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control. These factors include the necessity of arranging separate leases, mortgage loans or other financings to provide the capital required to complete these projects; difficulties or delays in obtaining zoning, land use, building, occupancy, licensing, certificate of need and other required governmental permits and approvals; failure to complete construction of the projects on budget and on schedule; failure of third-party contractors and subcontractors to perform under their contracts; shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive; adverse weather conditions that could delay completion of projects; increased costs resulting from general economic conditions or increases in the cost of materials; and increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will elect to undertake or complete all of our proposed expansion, renovation, repositioning and redevelopment projects, or that we will not experience delays in completing those projects. In addition, we may incur substantial costs prior to achieving stabilized occupancy for each such project and cannot assure you that these costs will not be greater than we have anticipated. We also cannot assure you that any of our expansion, renovation, repositioning or redevelopment projects will be economically successful. Our failure to achieve our expansion, renovation, repositioning and redevelopment plans could adversely impact our anticipated revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may encounter difficulties in acquiring communities at attractive prices or integrating acquisitions with our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe will continue to selectively target strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. To the extent we do identify and complete any future acquisition opportunities, the process of identifying potential acquisition candidates, completing acquisition transactions and integrating acquired communities into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, divert managerial attention or require significant financial or other resources. These acquisitions and other future acquisitions may require us to incur additional indebtedness and contingent liabilities, and may result in unforeseen expenses or compliance issues, which may adversely affect our revenue growth, results of operations and cash flow. Moreover, any future acquisitions may not generate any additional income for us or provide any benefit to our business. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and acquire communities at attractive prices in locations that are compatible with our strategy or that competition for the acquisition of communities will not increase. Finally, when we are able to locate communities and enter into definitive agreements to acquire or lease them, we cannot assure you that the transactions will be completed. Failure to complete transactions after we have entered into definitive agreements may result in significant expenses to us.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and successfully integrate new or recently-acquired or initiated operations into our existing operations, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur growth has and will continue to place significant demands on our current management resources. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to successfully integrate new or recently-acquired or initiated operations (including expansions, developments, acquisitions and the expansion of our ancillary services programs) into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting qualified individuals to the extent necessary, and management may expend significant time and energy attracting the appropriate personnel to manage assets we purchase in the future and our expansion and development activities. Also, the additional communities and expansion activities will require us to maintain consistent quality control measures that allow our management to effectively identify deviations that result in delivering care and services that are substandard, which may result in litigation and/or loss of licensure or certification. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate new or recently-acquired or initiated operations into our existing business, or maintain consistent quality control measures, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of communities could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe plan to continue to selectively target strategic acquisitions of operating companies, senior living communities and ancillary services companies as opportunities arise. Despite our extensive underwriting and due diligence procedures, operating companies and communities that we have previously acquired or may acquire in the future may generate unexpectedly low or no returns or may not meet a risk profile that our investors find acceptable. In addition, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any of the acquired operating companies and communities, including contingent liabilities, or newly acquired communities or operating companies might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. For example, a community may require capital expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts, or it may experience management turnover that is higher than we project. These costs may negatively affect our future results of operations and cash flow.\nCompetition for the acquisition of strategic assets from buyers with greater financial resources or lower costs of capital than us or that have lower return expectations than we do could limit our ability to compete for strategic acquisitions and therefore to grow our business effectively.\nSeveral publicly-traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and private equity firms have similar asset acquisition objectives as we do, along with greater financial resources and/or lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain. This may increase competition for acquisitions that would be suitable to us. There is significant competition among potential acquirers in the senior living industry, including publicly-traded and non-traded REITs and private equity firms, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete acquisitions, which could limit our ability to grow our business effectively. Partially as a result of tax law changes enacted through RIDEA, we now compete more directly with the various publicly-traded healthcare REITs for the acquisition of senior housing properties.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approvals could hinder our plans to expand our ancillary services programs, which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe plan to expand our offering of ancillary services (including therapy, home health and hospice) to additional markets. In the current environment, it is difficult to obtain certain required regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals could impede our ability to expand to additional markets in accordance with our plans, which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur investment in our entrance fee CCRC venture with HCP is susceptible to risks associated with the lifecare benefits offered to the residents of the venture's lifecare entrance fee communities, and we are also susceptible to such risks for our owned and/or operated entrance fee CCRCs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we managed lifecare entrance fee communities as part of our entrance fee CCRC venture with HCP, and we owned and/or operated three other lifecare communities. Residents of these communities typically receive a limited lifecare benefit and pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy, of which a portion is generally refundable, with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community. This limited lifecare benefit is typically (a) a certain number of free days in the community's health center during the resident's lifetime, (b) a discounted rate for such services, or (c) a combination of the two. The lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident's entrance fee is refundable. The pricing of entrance fees, refundability provisions, monthly service fees, and lifecare benefits are determined utilizing actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population. In the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for these communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents, our interest in the results of operations and cash flow of these communities and the venture could be adversely affected.\nResidents of these entrance fee communities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime, even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community. In addition, in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives, the community must contract with a third party to provide such care. Although we screen potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets, income, and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to the entrance fee communities during their lifetime, we cannot assure you that such assets, income, and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases. If insufficient, we or the entrance fee CCRC venture, as applicable, would have rights of set-off against the refundable portions of the residents' deposits, and would also seek available reimbursement under Medicaid or other available programs. To the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them, or in the event that these communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of these communities, our interest in the results of operations and cash flow of these communities and the venture would be adversely affected.\nEarly termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could cause a loss in revenues and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe operate certain of our communities pursuant to management agreements. In some of these cases, the controlling financial interest in the community is held by third parties and, in other cases, the community is owned by an unconsolidated venture in which we have an ownership interest. At December 31, 2016, we managed 153 communities, representing approximately 25% of our capacity, for third parties or unconsolidated ventures. The majority of our management agreements are long-term agreements. In most cases, either party to the agreements may terminate upon the occurrence of an event of default caused by the other party. In addition, in some cases, subject to our rights, if any, to cure deficiencies, community owners may terminate us as manager if any licenses or certificates necessary for operation are revoked, if we do not satisfy certain designated performance thresholds or if the community is sold to an unrelated third party (in which case we may be entitled to receive a contractual termination fee). Also, in some instances, a community owner may terminate the management agreement relating to a particular community if we are in default under other management agreements relating to other communities owned by the same owner or its affiliates. Certain of our management agreements, both with unconsolidated ventures and with entities owned by third parties, provide that an event of default under the debt instruments applicable to the ventures or the entities owned by third parties that is caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the relevant management agreement, giving the non-Brookdale party to the management agreement the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the management agreement, potentially including termination of the management agreement. Further, in the event of default on a loan, the lender may have the ability to terminate us as manager. With respect to communities held in unconsolidated ventures, in some cases, the management agreement can be terminated in connection with the sale by the venture partner of its interest in the venture or the sale of properties by the venture. Early termination of our management agreements or non-renewal or renewal on less-favorable terms could cause a loss in revenues and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe geographic concentration of our communities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn, regulatory changes or acts of nature in those areas, resulting in a decrease in our revenues or an increase in our costs, or otherwise negatively impacting our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have a high concentration of communities in various geographic areas, including the states of California, Florida and Texas. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules and regulations, particularly with respect to assisted living communities, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for senior living services in these states could have an adverse effect on our revenues, costs, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, given the location of our communities, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by other severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornados. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance.\nTermination of our resident agreements and vacancies in the living spaces we lease could adversely affect our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nState regulations governing assisted living communities require written resident agreements with each resident. Several of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, many of our assisted living resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements upon 0 to 30 days' notice. Unlike typical apartment leasing or independent living arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer, in many instances we cannot contract with our assisted living residents to stay in those living spaces for longer periods of time. Our retirement center resident agreements generally provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate his or her lease upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the community. If multiple residents terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected. In addition, because of the demographics of our typical residents, including age and health, resident turnover rates in our communities are difficult to predict. As a result, the living spaces we lease may be unoccupied for a period of time, which could adversely affect our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nDeparture of our key officers could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers. The unforeseen loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nEnvironmental contamination at any of our communities could result in substantial liabilities to us, which may exceed the value of the underlying assets and which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of, or related to the release of, certain hazardous or toxic substances, that could be located on, in, at or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property's value and/or our assets' value. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents and retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property. In addition, such laws impose liability, which may be joint and several, for investigation, remediation, removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Although we do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities as would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we could be subject to substantial future liability for environmental contamination that we have no knowledge about as of the date of this report and/or for which we may not be at fault.\nFailure to comply with existing environmental laws could result in increased expenditures, litigation and potential loss to our business and in our asset value, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties.\nSome of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents. Each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste, but the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed.\nFederal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building's management to identify and warn their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building's management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials.\nThe presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan and may result in third party litigation for personal injury or property damage. Furthermore, in some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community's market value.\nAlthough we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, if we fail to comply with such laws in the future, we would face increased expenditures both in terms of fines and remediation of the underlying problem(s), potential litigation relating to exposure to such materials, and potential decrease in value to our business and in the value of our underlying assets. Therefore, our failure to comply with existing environmental laws would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change, such as the proposed \"cap and trade\" legislation) could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities.\nRisks Related to Pending Litigation\nComplaints filed against us could, if adversely determined, subject us to a material loss.\nWe have been and are currently involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business that are comparable to other companies in the senior living and healthcare industries. Certain claims and lawsuits allege large damage amounts and may require significant costs to defend and resolve. Similarly, the senior living and healthcare industries are continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators, which could result in litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. As a result, we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate, based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards. Our current policies are written on a claims-made basis and provide for deductibles for each claim. Accordingly, we are, in effect, self-insured for claims that are less than the deductible amounts. If we experience a greater number of losses than we anticipate, or if certain claims are not ultimately covered by insurance, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe face periodic and routine reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs, including but not limited to the RAC and ZPIC programs, in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews, audits and investigations may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Moreover, an adverse review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to the federal or state programs;\n\u2022\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions (including payment suspensions) on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program or state programs;\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets; or\n\u2022\nsignificant investment of time and money even if eventually favorably determined.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe cost and difficulty of complying with increasing and evolving regulation and enforcement could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to evolve and intensify in the amount and type of laws and regulations affecting it, many of which vary from state to state. In addition, many senior living communities are subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. In several of the states in which we operate or may operate, we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses. Also, in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate, assisted living communities and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded. Furthermore, federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws, particularly with respect to large for-profit, multi-community providers like us. These requirements and the increased enforcement thereof, could affect our ability to expand into new markets, to expand our services and communities in existing markets and, if any of our presently licensed communities were to operate outside of its licensing authority, may subject us to penalties including closure of the community. Future regulatory developments as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials could cause our operations to suffer. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local legislation or regulation. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, our business, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nThe intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements. We also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Although most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed-to plan of corrective action, the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified facility, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state. Revocation of a license at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities, which may also cause us to be in default under our leases, trigger cross-defaults, trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one community's citation would impact another of our communities, this would also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the future could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole.\nThere are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referral relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers, including those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. Some examples are the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the False Claims Act, which gives private individuals the ability to bring an action on behalf of the federal government. The violation of any of these laws or regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could increase our costs and otherwise jeopardize our business. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA 2005, every entity that receives at least $5.0 million annually in Medicaid payments must have established written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and similar state laws. Failure to comply with this compliance requirement may potentially give rise to potential liability. DRA 2005 also creates an incentive for states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal False Claims Act.\nAdditionally, we provide services and operate communities that participate in federal and/or state health care reimbursement programs, which makes us subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practice. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure, civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and/or state health care reimbursement program. Loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and/or trigger cross-defaults.\nWe are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state referral laws. Authorities have interpreted the Federal Anti-Kickback Law very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral. This could result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may also cause us to default under our leases and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our business, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures, which could increase our costs and therefore adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our communities are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for \"public accommodations\" and \"commercial properties,\" but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of government fines or an award of damages to private litigants.\nWe must also comply with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits us from discriminating against individuals on certain bases in any of our practices if it would cause such individuals to face barriers in gaining residency in any of our communities. Additionally, the Fair Housing Act and other state laws require that we advertise our services in such a way that we promote diversity and not limit it. We may be required, among other things, to change our marketing techniques to comply with these requirements.\nIn addition, we are required to operate our communities in compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing or certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time to time. Like other health care facilities, senior living communities are subject to periodic survey or inspection by governmental authorities to assess and assure compliance with regulatory requirements. Surveys occur on a regular (often annual or bi-annual) schedule, and special surveys may result from a specific complaint filed by a resident, a family member or one of our competitors. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements.\nCapital expenditures we have made to comply with any of the above to date have been immaterial, however, the increased costs and capital expenditures that we may incur in order to comply with any of the above would result in a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant legal actions and liability claims against us in excess of insurance limits could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe senior living and healthcare services businesses entail an inherent risk of liability, particularly given the demographics of our residents, including age and health, and the services we provide. In recent years, we, as well as other participants in our industry, have been subject to an increasing number of claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects. Many of these lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs. Many states continue to consider tort reform and how it will apply to the senior living industry. We may continue to be faced with the threat of large jury verdicts in jurisdictions that do not find favor with large senior living or healthcare providers. We maintain liability insurance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards. We have formed a wholly-owned \"captive\" insurance company for the purpose of insuring certain portions of our risk retention under our general and professional liability insurance programs. There can be no guarantee that we will not have any claims that exceed our policy limits in the future.\nIf a successful claim is made against us and it is not covered by our insurance or exceeds the policy limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In some states, state law may prohibit or limit insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and/or litigation. As a result, we may be liable for punitive damage awards in these states that either are not covered or are in excess of our insurance policy limits. Also, the above deductibles, or self-insured retention, are accrued based on an actuarial projection of future liabilities. If these projections are inaccurate and if there are an unexpectedly large number of successful claims that result in liabilities in excess of our self-insured retention, our operating results could be negatively affected. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract residents or expand our business and could require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the day-to-day operation of our business. We also have to renew our policies every year and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage, exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets, including the possibility of rate increases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or, if available, that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts, including:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, each of whom serve three-year terms;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause, and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nblank-check preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovisions preventing stockholders from calling special meetings or acting by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings; and\n\u2022\nno provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election.\nAdditionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders in certain situations, will not apply to us.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on loans, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and have no obligation to make funds available to us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flow;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating performance and liquidity guidance;\n\u2022\nthe contents of published research reports about us or the senior living industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nany increased indebtedness we may incur or lease obligations we may enter into in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nspeculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or the senior living industry in general;\n\u2022\nproxy contests or other shareholder activism;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022\ndownturns in the real estate market or changes in market valuations of senior living communities;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting the senior living industry or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering additional debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, convertible securities, series of preferred shares or shares of our common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Shares of our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their share holdings in us.\nWe may issue all of the shares of our common stock that are authorized but unissued (and not otherwise reserved for issuance under our stock incentive or purchase plans or pursuant to the conversion or exercise features of our convertible senior notes and warrants) without any action or approval by our stockholders. We may issue shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions of existing operating companies, senior living communities and ancillary services companies. Any shares issued in connection with our acquisitions or otherwise would dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 185.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding (excluding unvested restricted shares). All of the shares of our common stock are freely transferable, except for any shares held by our \"affiliates,\" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or any shares otherwise subject to the limitations of Rule 144.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 4.6 million shares of restricted common stock were outstanding under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan and our Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, and we had availability to issue approximately 4.6 million additional shares under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, our Associate Stock Purchase Plan, and our Director Stock Purchase Plan. The shares of our common stock issued or issuable pursuant to these plans are or will be registered under the Securities Act, and once any restrictions imposed on the shares and options granted under these plans expire, such shares of common stock will be available for sale into the public markets.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments will be limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforward and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. We have determined that an ownership change occurred within the second quarter of 2010, and, therefore, losses carried into the change period have been subject to an annual limitation. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change, adjusted for certain items. The annual limitation may be increased by certain built-in gains existing at the time of change. The acquisition of Emeritus Corporation also resulted in an ownership change and created an annual limitation on Emeritus' net operating losses.", "PERMNO": 90988, "SIC": 8050, "TIC": "BKD"}
