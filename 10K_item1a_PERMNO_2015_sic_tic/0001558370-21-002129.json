RISK FACTORS\nMany factors may have an effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business and financial conditions. The factors, as may be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, described below represent our principal risks.\nGlobal and National Risks Related to our Business\nOur industry, as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent, is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a recession.\nOur financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the United States and globally, including North America, Europe and in Asia, but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products. Global or domestic actions or conditions, including political actions, trade policies or restrictions, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), changes in tax laws, terrorism, natural disasters, or pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, such as COVID-19, could result in changing economic conditions in the United States and globally, disruptions to or slowdowns in our business or our global or domestic industry, or those of our customers or suppliers upon whom we are dependent. Additionally, periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty, including the pace of domestic non-residential construction activity.\nOur business is also dependent upon certain industries, such as construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including OCTG) markets, and these industries are also cyclical in nature. Therefore, these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions, raw material and energy costs, consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. A downturn in our industry or the industries we serve may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, may adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business. We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers\u2019 business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. A disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our customers and suppliers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGlobal steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the United States have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, United States steel prices, which, together with increased scrap prices, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGlobal steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products, which adversely affects United States and global steel prices. Such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products, including pre-fabricated long product steel, at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices, and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of steel and steel products, including pre-fabricated steel, into the United States, have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on United States steel and steel products prices, which adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Fluctuations in the value of the dollar can also affect imports, as strong United States dollar makes imported products less expensive, potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors. Furthermore, anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity. This, in turn, may also increase domestic demand for ferrous scrap. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are driven primarily from the metal spread achieved from the price we sell steel and steel products compared to the price of our metallic raw materials, including scrap. During prolonged periods of steel and steel products overcapacity, leading to lower selling prices, combined with high demand for scrap and raw materials, leading to higher buying prices, our metal spreads could be compressed, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnited States steel producers compete with many foreign producers, including those in China, Vietnam and other Asian and European countries. Competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries, at times due to imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. Some foreign steel producers are owned, controlled or subsidized by foreign governments. As a result, decisions by these producers with respect to their production, sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions, realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss. Additionally, low iron ore prices, resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore, leads to reduced global costs to produce steel, further depressing steel import prices. A higher volume of steel imports into the United States tends to occur at depressed prices when foreign steelmaking countries experience periods of economic difficulty, decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity. The global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by Chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country\u2019s demand and has made China a major global exporter of steel, resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected. While tariffs pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (Section 232), other measures to curb unfair trade such as duties or quotas, and the renegotiation of trade agreements with other countries, including the USMCA, have decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports, domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products. Should the Section 232 tariffs, duties or quotas expire or be relaxed, repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products, or should trade agreements be renegotiated, downward pressure may be exerted on United States steel and steel products prices, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. Other pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues may also adversely affect us. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in various government actions globally, including United States federal and state governmental actions designed to slow the spread of the virus and its impacts. These actions have included quarantines, \u201cshelter in place,\u201d \u201cstay at home\u201d and \u201csocial distancing\u201d orders, business shutdowns and restrictions, travel restrictions and other mitigation efforts, which, among other things, have impacted and may further impact demand for our products, as well as our supply chain. These measures, along with further voluntary measures by businesses and individuals, have impacted and may further impact our working conditions, productivity and operations, as well as those of our customers and suppliers. These mitigation measures have also adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the United States and global economies, resulting in increased unemployment in the United States and the communities in which we operate. However, due to our variable compensation system that rewards productivity, as well as our low fixed cost structure, we have not and do not expect in the future to significantly reduce our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have been identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a critical infrastructure industry and have been deemed an essential business in all of the states in which we operate. This has permitted us to continue to advance our commitment to our customers and meet their demand by operating our business consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, including social distancing guidelines. Our teams are our most valued priority, and we have implemented numerous process and procedural initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our people, their families and our communities. We have adjusted schedules to support social distancing, provided additional and more frequent sanitizing applications, provided additional protective measures, among many other actions. These health and safety initiatives have not and are not expected to have a material effect on our operations, but further required limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, while we have not currently curtailed our operations, a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, resurgence or further spread of the virus could further materially reduce demand for our products and thus, reduce the productivity of our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Certain of our customers and suppliers, such as those in the automotive, energy and related industries, have experienced and in the future may experience temporary shutdowns or significant demand reductions, adversely affecting our operations. Further reduced demand for our products or raw material supply availability due to shutdowns or slowdowns in businesses may further adversely affect our volumes and margins, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event equipment or supplier personnel from foreign countries are delayed due to COVID-19 related constraints, our ability to complete construction and commissioning of our new Southwest-Sinton Flat Roll Division could be delayed beyond the expected commencement of operations in mid-year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused volatility in the financial and capital markets and led to new and expanded governmental programs and initiatives, which affected and may further affect our stock price.\nThere is considerable uncertainty regarding the economic and industry impacts, including duration, from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures introduced to curtail its spread and its impacts. In the event vaccinations for COVID-19 have unanticipated side-effects, are not widely administered or have more limited than expected benefits, the effects of COVID-19 on the economy and our business could worsen. Although these highly uncertain future impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time,\ngeneral economic conditions, business closures, slow payments from customers, increased bankruptcies, and labor restrictions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price.\nIndustry Risks Related to our Business\nOur level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve.\nThe steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature, and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control. Furthermore, a number of our products are commodities, subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries, including the construction and manufacturing industries. The timing, magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict. The sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries, such as construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including OCTG) markets. Economic difficulties, stagnant or slow global economies, supply/demand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the United States or globally may decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the United States, which may decrease our sales, margins and profitability.\nVolatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes, supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers, may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nSteel producers require large amounts of raw materials, including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron, pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc, graphite electrodes and ferroalloys. Our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from industrial scrap and end-of-life automobiles, appliances and machinery, and demolition scrap from obsolete structures, containers, and machinery. The prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including demand by United States and foreign steel producers, freight costs and speculation. The scrap metal recycling industry has historically been, and is expected to remain, highly cyclical and the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past, may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel. Moreover, some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix, which, during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers, give them a raw material cost advantage over EAF mills. While our vertical integration into the metals recycling business and our liquid pig-iron operations are expected to enable us to continue being a cost-effective supplier to our own steelmaking operations, for some of our metallics requirements, we still rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers, as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs.\nThe availability and prices of raw materials, and supplies may also be negatively affected by new, existing, or changing laws and regulations, including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or GHG allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations, the availability and cost of transportation, and competing uses. As a major producer of galvanized steel products, we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc, which if purchased at high prices, may adversely affect our profit margins. Any inability to secure a consistent, cost-effective and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases or to provide for our customers\u2019 needs because of the potential unavailability of raw materials or supplies, may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions.\nSteel producers like us consume large amounts of energy to melt ferrous scrap in EAFs and reheat steel for rolling into finished products. We rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions, often affected by weather conditions as well as political, environmental and economic factors beyond our control. As consumers of electricity and natural gas, we must have dependable delivery in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption, including power outages or power unavailability. Prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production. Since a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck, unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also adversely affect our costs or the costs of many of our customers.\nCompliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements may result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs.\nExisting laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future, as well as future laws or regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to, among other things:\n\u25cfthe generation, storage, treatment, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and secondary materials;\n\u25cf\nthe discharge of materials into the air, including periodic changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and to emission standards;\n\u25cfthe management, treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water;\n\u25cfthe use and treatment of groundwater;\n\u25cfthe remediation of soil and groundwater contamination;\n\u25cfclimate change legislation or regulation;\n\u25cfthe need for and the ability to timely obtain air, water or other environmental permits;\n\u25cfthe timely reporting of certain chemical usage, content, storage and releases;\n\u25cfthe remediation and reclamation of land used in our operations;\n\u25cfnatural resource protections; and\n\u25cfthe protection of our employees\u2019 health and safety.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, which affect our steelmaking, metals recycling, liquid pig-iron, and copper and aluminum production operations, is a significant factor in our business. We are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses, and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license may result in substantial fines and penalties, capital expenditures, operational changes, suspension of operations and/or the closure of a subject facility. Similarly, delays, increased costs and/or the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits may adversely affect these operations.\nUncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations. Although we strive to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance. Private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions and/or for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. The cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or with future laws or regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials. For example, our steel mills generate EAF dust, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States EPA) and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner.\nIn addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile bodies. A portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue. If laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to EAF dust or shredder residue or other by-products created by our operations, we may incur significant additional expenditures.\nFederal and state environmental laws enable the United States EPA, state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners, operators, generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed. In connection with these laws, we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including\ncontamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites, to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed, and/or to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to pay for, or to pay a portion of, the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling, notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect. Under certain laws, a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site. In practice, a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties. We have received notices from the United States EPA, state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites. In most cases, many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs.\nBecause cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago, and because the United States EPA and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment, we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites.\nIncreased regulation associated with the environment, climate change, GHG emissions and sustainability could impose significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations.\nThe United States government, various other governmental agencies, regulators, investors or other groups may introduce, request or require environmental monitoring, disclosures or regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of GHG emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms. Any such regulation or disclosure requirement could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws, regulations or demands concerning the environment, climate change, GHG emissions and sustainability. Any adopted future regulations could negatively impact our ability, and that of our customers and suppliers, to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations. We may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit GHGs as a result of these initiatives, which may impact our operations directly or through our customers and suppliers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete.\nOperational and Commercial Risks Related to our Business\nWe may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers, scrap processors and alternative materials, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries. Additionally, in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, plastics, carbon fiber, glass and wood. Increased use of alternative materials for any reason, including as a response to regulations, could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us, and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, any one of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAvailability of an adequate source of supply is required for our metals recycling operations.\nWe procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us. In periods of low industry scrap prices, scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities. If a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us, we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a slowdown of industrial production in the United States reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry, resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks, and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary information, financial information, customer and supplier information, and personally identifiable information. Additionally, such cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems, which, if compromised, could cease, threaten, delay or slow down our ability to melt, roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption. Our customers and suppliers may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems, which if breached or attacked, could likewise expose our sensitive information. Any of these cybersecurity and information technology breaches or disruptions may result in reputational harm and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data, networks and information and operating technology and systems, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or cybersecurity breach or attack, will be prevented, whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee, contractor or other error or malfeasance. This could lead to system interruption, production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions, and the disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive data, which may adversely affect our reputation, customer and supplier relationships, financial results and results of operations, and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations, actions, fines or penalties, as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs, including the cost of insurance. Additionally, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may need to invest additional time, resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data, systems and information networks. We maintain an information security risk insurance policy to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity threats and we did not incur any net expenses from information security breach penalties and settlements during 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nWe may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy subjects us to various risks. As part of our growth strategy, we may expand existing facilities, enter into new product or process initiatives, acquire or build additional plants, acquire other businesses and assets, enter into joint ventures, or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business. These expansions and transactions may involve some or all of the following risks:\n\u25cfthe risk of entering product or domestic or foreign geographic markets in which we have little experience;\n\u25cfthe risk of a newly constructed steel mill being completed over budget or not on time;\n\u25cfthe risk of not being able to adequately obtain sufficient labor to efficiently build or staff a new steel mill;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of expected markets, products, customers and demand for products produced by a new steel mill being lower than expected;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us;\n\u25cfthe inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits;\n\u25cfthe difficulty of integrating new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations;\n\u25cfthe potential disruption of ongoing operations;\n\u25cfthe diversion of financial resources or management attention to new operations or acquired businesses;\n\u25cfthe loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses;\n\u25cfthe potential exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cfthe inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cfthe difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of becoming involved in labor, commercial, or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new operations or acquired businesses;\n\u25cfthe risk of becoming more highly leveraged;\n\u25cfthe risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation;\n\u25cfthe inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners; and\n\u25cfthe difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nOur new Southwest-Sinton Flat Roll Division is under construction in Sinton, Texas, and is planned to commence operations in mid-year 2021, with a total expected capital investment of approximately $1.9 billion. The project is subject to the above risks, as well\nas unfavorable weather conditions, natural disasters, delayed equipment deliveries and installations, or other conditions outside our control which could increase the capital investment or delay the commencement of operations of our new EAF steel mill. As we begin operations, we could face additional risks related to human capital attraction, development and retention, as well as start-up inefficiencies. Additionally, customer, product, or geographic markets we expect to serve may not be as profitable as currently expected, which may adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive, but we may not be able to complete any such expansions or transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing, if necessary. Future expansions and transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated, and if they do not, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are involved from time to time in various routine litigation matters, including administrative proceedings, regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial and construction contract disputes, none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions, results of operations or liquidity. For additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nIn addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance, our international operations are subject to complex foreign and United States laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other laws and regulations, each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk.\nUnexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInterruptions in our production capabilities may adversely affect our production costs, products available for sale and earnings during the affected period. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment, such as our EAFs, continuous casters and rolling equipment, some of which are controlled by our information technology systems, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, including cybersecurity breaches or attacks or system failures. We have experienced plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures, or other events. These disruptions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits.\nWe must receive licenses and air, water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to build, expand or acquire new facilities, such as our new EAF flat roll steel mill in Sinton, Texas, currently under construction in Sinton, Texas. Governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and members of the public sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility.\nRestrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements, including our senior unsecured credit facility, and any future financing agreements, may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. A breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior unsecured credit facility, our senior notes, or our other debt. A significant portion of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable.\nUnder our senior unsecured credit facility, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability. Our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control. If a default were to occur, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nImpairment charges may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOccasionally, assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop, about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit, or about industry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated. In such instances, the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet.\nAccordingly, we periodically test goodwill, long-lived tangible and intangible assets and right of use assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets, from whatever cause, is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, we are required to incur non-cash asset impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges.", "PERMNO": 84262, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "STLD"}
