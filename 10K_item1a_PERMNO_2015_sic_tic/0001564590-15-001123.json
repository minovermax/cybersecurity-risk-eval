{"cik": "943861", "company": "GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended concerning the Company\u2019s operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and natural gas properties, marketing and midstream activities, and also include those statements accompanied by or that otherwise include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d or similar expressions or variations on such expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made; the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risk and uncertainties:\n\u00b7\nplanned capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nfuture drilling activity;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition;\n\u00b7\nbusiness strategy including the our ability to successfully transition to more liquids-focused operations;\n\u00b7\nthe market prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in the commodity-futures market;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7\nfinancial market conditions and availability of capital;\n\u00b7\nproduction;\n\u00b7\nhedging arrangements;\n\u00b7\nfuture cash flows and borrowings;\n\u00b7\nlitigation matters;\n\u00b7\npursuit of potential future acquisition opportunities;\n\u00b7\nsources of funding for exploration and development;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions, either nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we are doing business;\n\u00b7\nlegislative or regulatory changes, including retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, hydraulic-fracturing regulation, drilling and permitting regulations, derivatives reform, changes in state and federal corporate taxes, environmental regulation, environmental risks and liability under federal, state and foreign and local environmental laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe creditworthiness of our financial counterparties and operation partners;\n\u00b7\nthe securities, capital or credit markets;\n\u00b7\nour ability to repay our debt; and\n\u00b7\nother factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings, press releases and discussions with our management.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report. These differences may be material.\nThe proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in this report are estimates. These estimates are based on reports prepared by NSAI and RSC, our independent reserve engineers, and were calculated using the unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices in 2014. The prices we receive for our production may be lower than those upon which our reserve estimates are based. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u00b7\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells;\n\u00b7\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u00b7\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u00b7\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u25cf\nthe quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u25cf\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u25cf\nfuture oil and natural gas sales prices.\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material. The discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. As required by the SEC, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on 12-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u00b7\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nincreases or decreases in consumption; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, and which we use in calculating our PV-10, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile; a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas would adversely impact our business.\nOur success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas. These market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control. The prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions. The\ngeneral pace of global economic growth, the continued instability in the Middle East and other oil and natural gas producing regions and actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as other economic, political, and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices. Domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including U.S. economic conditions, weather patterns, other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels, the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply, and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry.\nNatural gas and crude oil prices are extremely volatile. For example, spot prices for New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) West Texas Intermediate crude-oil ranged from a high of $107.95 per barrel to a low of $53.45 per barrel during 2014. Spot prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $8.15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to a low of $2.99 per MMBtu during 2014. Furthermore, oil prices experienced a significant decline during the fourth quarter of 2014 with NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude-oil spot prices declining from $91.02 per barrel in October 2014 to $53.45 in December 2014. Crude-oil spot prices continued their decline through January 2015 down to $44.08 per barrel.\nAverage oil and natural gas prices varied substantially during the past few years. Any actual or anticipated reduction in natural gas and crude oil and prices may further depress the level of exploration, drilling and production activity. We expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future.\nChanges in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. Our average realized prices for natural gas increased slightly in 2014 but still remain below average historical prices. These lower prices, coupled with the slow recovery in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital, have compelled most oil and natural gas producers, including us, to reduce the level of exploration, drilling and production activity. This will have a significant effect on our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. Any sustained reductions in oil and natural gas prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. A reduction in our reserves could have other adverse consequences including a possible downward redetermination of the availability of borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between the Company and Wells Fargo and certain lenders dated May 5, 2009, as amended (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d), which would restrict our liquidity. Additionally, further or continued declines in prices could result in non-cash charges to earnings due to impairment write downs. Any such write down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nOur operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, state, tribal, local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting and changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies or price gathering-rate controls. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, tribal and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including tax laws, and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits, including drilling permits, before conducting regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of civil and criminal fines and penalties, the revocation of permits or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our operations in certain areas. Moreover,\nprivate parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in legal requirements related to the protection of the environment could result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Such changes could also require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance, and also have the potential to reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as government reviews of such activity could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations such as shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued guidance in February 2014 related to such activities. Moreover, the EPA has promulgated rules under the federal Clean Air Act requiring operators to use \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture the emission of volatile organic compounds from well completion activities involving the use of hydraulic fracturing. The rules also regulate emissions from new or modified compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks, and other production equipment. Also, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act in May 2014 seeking comment on potential rules that would require companies to disclose the chemical additives used in their hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a draft report expected to be issued for peer review and comment sometime in the first half of 2015. The EPA has also announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities sometime in the first half of 2015. These results of studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nCongress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Louisiana and Texas, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Moreover, some states and local governments have enacted laws or regulations limiting hydraulic fracturing within their borders or prohibiting the activity altogether. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nCertain scientific studies have found that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d are contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Recently, the EPA finalized modifications to its GHG reporting rules that would require covered entities to report emissions on an individual GHG basis. In addition, the EPA has proposed a rule that would expand the agency\u2019s reporting requirements to cover emissions from completions and workovers of hydraulically fractured oil wells. Also, the Obama Administration is expected to propose a series of new regulations on the oil and gas industry in 2015,\nincluding federal standards limiting methane emissions. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs for our business.\nIn addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. Such climatic events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred losses from operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $354.8 million, $36.3 million, $63.7 million, $17.1 million and $280.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our development of and participation of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nOur future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity.\nDrilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves. However, drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Exploration activities involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, the future cost and timing of drilling, completing and producing wells is often uncertain. Furthermore, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nlack of acceptable prospective acreage;\n\u00b7\ninadequate capital resources;\n\u00b7\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nunavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment or labor;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties; and\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with horizontal drilling.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often uncertain.\nIn addition, while lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, higher oil and natural gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of, and increased costs for, such drilling equipment, services and personnel. Such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned. Any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues.\nA sustained depression of oil and natural gas prices can affect our ability to obtain funding, obtain funding on acceptable terms or obtain funding under our current credit facility. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nWe cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience drilling wells on our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale trend acreage, which has a limited operational history and is subject to more uncertainties than our drilling program in more established formations.\nWe, along with other operators, have begun drilling wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale trend only recently. Accordingly, we have limited information on which we can determine optimum drilling and completion strategies, or estimate production decline rates or recoverable reserves from drilling on our acreage in this trend. Our drilling plans with respect to the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale trend are flexible and depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which our initial wells in the trend are commercially successful.\nA substantial portion of our near term capital investments will be concentrated in the development of the recently acquired acreage in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale.\nWe intend to devote a substantial portion of our near term capital expenditures on drilling and completion activity (including facilities and infrastructure) in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale. The results of these investments may not prove as attractive as we anticipate, and the concentration of such funding and activity in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale will divert those resources from use to further develop our other properties. There can be no assurance that these investments will generate any specific return on investment.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margin. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures; therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flow. The proposed margin rules are not yet final, and therefore the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to\nreduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations on us is uncertain.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income.\nWe use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases. We hedged approximately 77% (approximately 73% of natural gas production and approximately 82% of oil production) of our total production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by our commodity derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we received cash receipts to settle our derivative contracts totaling $3.4 million, while we paid $3.8 million to settle our derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had a net asset derivative position of $46.9 million related to our derivative contracts compared to a net asset derivative position of $0.9 million at December 31, 2013. The ultimate settlement amount of these derivative contract positions is dependent on future commodity prices.\nWe account for our oil and natural gas derivatives using fair value accounting standards. Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value. Additionally, changes in a derivative\u2019s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swaps and, as such, all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings. Our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception. Contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark-to-market accounting treatment.\nIn the future, we will continue to be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. See Note 8-\u201cDerivative Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause our operations require significant capital expenditures, we may not have the funds available to replace reserves, maintain production or maintain interests in our properties.\nWe must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities, proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales. Our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons. If our revenues or cash flows decrease, we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels. If this occurs, our production will decline over time. Other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to\nimplement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. Where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and natural gas property, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property. If we cannot fund such capital expenditures, our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nIf we are unable to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production at present levels.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves will decline over time. In addition, approximately 54% of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at December 31, 2014, were undeveloped. By their nature, estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain particularly because we may chose not to develop such reserves on anticipated schedules in future adverse oil or natural gas price environments. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves. We may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future. In addition, we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs.\nWe may incur substantial impairment writedowns.\nIf management\u2019s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment writedowns in the future, which would result in a negative impact to our financial position. Furthermore, any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments. We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review. To determine if a depletable unit is impaired, we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management\u2019s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and natural gas reserves over the economic life of the property. Future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers\u2019 estimates of proved reserves. In addition, other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions. For each property determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis.\nFair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows. Any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset. Each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the depletable units\u2019 estimated reserves, future cash flows and fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairments related to oil and natural gas properties of $331.9 million and zero, respectively.\nManagement\u2019s assumptions used in calculating oil and natural gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future. Any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded, impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset. Any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property, as well as the property\u2019s fair value. Additionally, as management\u2019s views related to future prices change, the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates. Changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment.\nA majority of our production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nEssentially all of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014, and all our production during 2014 were associated with our Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi properties which include the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Haynesville Shale and Eagle Ford Shale Trends. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems, government intervention (including potential regulation or limitation of the use of high pressure fracture stimulation techniques in these formations) or natural disasters, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. For example, Chesapeake operates certain properties in the Haynesville Shale. We have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-\noperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.\nOur ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.\nWe operate primarily in (i) Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana which includes the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, (ii) South Texas, which includes the Eagle Ford Shale Trend and (iii) Northwest Louisiana and East Texas, which includes the Haynesville Shale Trend. A number of companies are currently operating in the Haynesville Shale and Eagle Ford Shale. If drilling in these areas continues to be successful, the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Because of the current economic climate, certain pipeline projects that are planned for Northwest Louisiana and East Texas may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our natural gas to interstate pipelines. In such an event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) or that we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nWe have in place a $600 million Senior Credit Facility with a borrowing base of $230 million on which we had $121.0 million drawn on December 31, 2014. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates. We also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our Senior Credit Facility. These restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted. The Senior Credit Facility matures on February 24, 2017. Any replacement credit facility may have more restrictive covenants or provide us with less borrowing capacity.\nWe may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nThe acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well, facility or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or subsurface groundwater contamination, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing. We may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. The incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nDue to the nature of the industry, we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and, accordingly, amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant. The loss of, or material nonpayment or nonperformance by, any one or more of these customers could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to the nature of the industry, we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and, accordingly, amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant. Revenues from the largest of these sources as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 57%, 71% and 49%, respectively. Some of our customers may have material financial and liquidity issues or may, as a result of operational incidents or other events, be\ndisproportionately affected as compared to larger, better-capitalized companies. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nCustomer credit risks could result in losses.\nOur exposure to non-payment or non-performance by our customers and counterparties presents a credit risk. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to satisfy obligations. We monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and established credit limits according to our credit policies and guidelines, but cannot assure that any losses will be consistent with our expectations. Furthermore, the concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. The revenues compared to our total oil and natural gas revenues from the top purchasers for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors.\nWe compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers, geoscientists and other professional staff. We depend to a large extent on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team. If a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nThe oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves many uncertainties, economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nThe nature of the oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves certain operating hazards such as:\n\u00b7\nwell blowouts;\n\u00b7\ncratering;\n\u00b7\nexplosions;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids;\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u00b7\nshortages of, or delays in, obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards such as crude oil spills;\n\u00b7\nnatural gas leaks;\n\u00b7\npipeline and tank ruptures;\n\u00b7\nunauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids or toxic gases into the environment;\n\u00b7\nencountering naturally occurring radioactive materials;\n\u00b7\nother pollution; and\n\u00b7\nother hazards and risks.\nAny of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred. The payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions. These reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties. Additionally, some of our oil and natural gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes. Some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production.\nWe cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.\nWe maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:\n\u00b7\npersonal injury;\n\u00b7\nbodily injury;\n\u00b7\nthird party property damage;\n\u00b7\nmedical expenses;\n\u00b7\nlegal defense costs;\n\u00b7\npollution in some cases;\n\u00b7\nwell blowouts in some cases; and\n\u00b7\nworkers compensation.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future. A loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss.", "PERMNO": 57509, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GDP"}
