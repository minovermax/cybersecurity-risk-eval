{"cik": "1582982", "company": "MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTION BILLING, CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur strategy is to expand through the acquisition of additional RCM companies and through organic growth. Since 2006, we have acquired fourteen RCM companies and entered into agreements with four additional RCM companies under which we service all of their customers. Our future acquisitions may require greater than anticipated investment of operational and financial resources as we seek to migrate customers of these companies to PracticePro. Acquisitions may also require the integration of different software and services, assimilation of new employees, diversion of management and IT resources, increases in administrative costs and other additional costs associated with any debt or equity financings undertaken in connection with such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any acquisition we undertake will be successful. Future growth will also place additional demands on our customer support, sales, and marketing resources, and may require us to hire and train additional employees. We will need to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our growth. The failure to manage our growth effectively will materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn prior acquisitions, we have encountered difficulties in retaining all the customers we acquired, which has resulted in a decrease in our revenues and operating results. Similarly, we may be unable to retain customers of acquired businesses following their acquisition, which may likewise result in a decrease in our revenues and operating results.\nCustomers of the businesses we acquire usually have the right to terminate their service contracts for any reason at any time upon notice of 90 days or less. These customers may elect to terminate their contracts as a result of our acquisition or choose not to renew their contracts upon expiration. In the past, our failure to retain acquired customers has resulted in decreases in our revenues. The customers of the seven businesses we acquired in 2012 through 2014, excluding CastleRock, generated a total of approximately $5.3 million of revenue per quarter at the time of their acquisition. On average, this amount decreased by 23% one year after each acquisition occurred. For CastleRock, in part due to prohibited competitive activities of a selling stockholder which we later resolved through a mutually satisfactory settlement, this decrease was 61%. Our inability to retain customers of the businesses we acquire could adversely affect our ability to benefit from those acquisitions and increase our future revenues and operating income.\nWe may be unable to negotiate favorable prices for the RCM companies we acquire.\nOur purchase prices for the 2014 Acquisitions took into account the uncertainty and time required for the closing of our public offering. In the future, our acquisition strategy and the consideration we pay for potential targets will be influenced by many factors, including the market demand for our securities and the condition of the healthcare industry in general. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and acquire medical billing companies on such favorable financial terms as those ultimately accepted by the 2014 Acquisitions, or that we will not be required to pay a premium for a desired acquisition opportunity.\nWe may be unable to implement our strategy of acquiring additional RCM companies due to competition.\nWe have no commitments with respect to any other acquisition as of the date of this Annual report on Form 10-K. Although we expect that one or more acquisition opportunities will become available in the future, we may not be able to acquire any additional RCM companies at all or on terms favorable to us. Certain of our larger, better capitalized competitors may seek to acquire some of the RCM companies we may be interested in. Competition for acquisitions would likely increase acquisition prices and result in us having fewer acquisition opportunities.\nAcquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks which may affect our customer retention and cause a reduction in our revenues.\nIn completing any future acquisitions, we will rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each acquisition as well as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot be assured that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their customers. To the extent that we are required to pay for obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected benefit from such acquisition and we will have overpaid in cash and/or stock for the value received in that acquisition.\nWe may have difficulty integrating future acquisitions into our operations and onto our software platform. Additionally, we may have difficulty migrating SoftCare\u2019s clearinghouse and electronic data interchange technology with our system.\nPart of our acquisition strategy is to migrate the customer accounts obtained to our platform software and have our off- shore teams perform the majority of the services for the customer. If we cannot migrate acquired customers to our platform software or have our off shore teams service the acquired customer, we would incur additional costs. Also, if we cannot migrate SoftCare\u2019s clearinghouse and electronic data interchange technology with our system, we may also incur additional costs.\nFuture acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense.\nFuture acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of known and unknown liabilities, the write-off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally structure our acquisitions as asset purchases, which may limit the ability of some of the acquired assets to be transferred to us due to contractual provisions restricting the assignment of assets, and subjects us to the risk that creditors of the seller may seek payment from us of liabilities retained by the sellers or challenge these transactions.\nOur acquisitions are typically structured as the purchase of assets, primarily consisting of medical billing contracts with healthcare providers. This structure may limit the transferability of some of the acquired assets, including contracts that have contractual provisions limiting their assignment. In our prior acquisitions, substantially all of the medical billing contracts we acquired did not have restrictions on their assignment to us. However, other medical billing contracts we may seek to acquire in the future may be subject to these restrictions. Furthermore, certain software and vendor contracts which we may seek to acquire for use during the transition period following our acquisitions may not be assignable to us, which may disrupt the operations of the acquired customers. Moreover, even those that are assignable may be terminable by either party upon little or no notice.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our competitors may be able to compete more efficiently or evolve more rapidly than we do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, growth rates and market share.\nThe market for practice management, EHR and RCM information solutions and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from other providers of both integrated and stand-alone practice management, EHR and RCM solutions, including competitors who utilize a web-based platform and providers of locally installed software systems. Our competitors include larger healthcare IT companies, such as athenahealth, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc., all of which may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations or customer needs and requirements. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We also compete with various regional RCM companies, some of which may continue to consolidate and expand into broader markets. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of incentives provided by the HITECH Act, and consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. Competitors may introduce products or services that render our products or services obsolete or less marketable. Even if our products and services are more effective than the offerings of our competitors, current or potential customers might prefer competitive products or services to our products and services. In addition, our competitive edge could be diminished or completely lost if our competition develops similar offshore operations in Pakistan or other countries, such as India and the Philippines, where labor costs are lower than those in the U.S. (although higher than in Pakistan). Pricing pressures could negatively impact our margins, growth rate and market share.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or services or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, we would not be able to maintain our customers or grow our business which will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services accordingly. If we cannot adapt to changing technologies and industry standards and meet the requirements of our customers, our products and services may become obsolete, and our business would suffer. Because both the healthcare industry and the healthcare IT technology market are constantly evolving, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis, educate our customers to adopt these new technologies, and successfully assist them in transitioning to our new products and services. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in developing, using, marketing, selling, or maintaining new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards, and, as a result, our business and reputation could suffer. We may not be able to introduce new products or services on schedule, or at all, or such products or services may not achieve market acceptance. A failure by us to introduce new products or to introduce these products on schedule could cause us to not only lose our current customers but to fail to grow our business by attracting new customers.\nThe continued success of our business model is heavily dependent upon our operations in Pakistan, and any disruption to those operations will adversely affect us.\nThe majority of our operations, including the development and maintenance of our Web-based platform, our customer support services and a substantial portion of our sales and marketing efforts, are performed by our highly educated workforce of approximately 1,500 employees in Pakistan, which has experienced, and continues to experience, political and social unrest and acts of terrorism. The performance of our operations in Pakistan, and our ability to maintain our offshore offices, is an essential element of our business model, as the labor costs in Pakistan are substantially lower than the cost of comparable labor in India, the United States and other countries, and allows us to competitively price our products and services. Our competitive advantage will be greatly diminished and may disappear altogether if our operations in Pakistan are negatively impacted. Our operations in Pakistan may be negatively impacted by any number of factors, including political unrest; social unrest; terrorism; war; failure of the Pakistani power grid, which is subject to frequent outages; vandalism; currency fluctuations; changes to the law of Pakistan, the United States or any of the states in which we do business; or increases in the cost of labor and supplies in Pakistan. Our operations in Pakistan may also be affected by trade restrictions, such as tariffs or other trade controls. If we are unable to continue to leverage the skills and experience of our highly educated workforce in Pakistan, we may be unable to provide our products and services at attractive prices, and our business would be materially and negatively impacted or discontinued.\nOur offshore operations expose us to additional business and financial risks which could subject us to civil and criminal liability.\nThe risks and challenges associated with our operations outside the United States include laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment and tax laws and regulations; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign operations subject us to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and comparable foreign laws and regulations that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage these practices may prove to be less than effective and violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC, Department of Justice and overseas regulators.\nGovernment programs in the United States initiated to accelerate the adoption and utilization of EHR solutions may not be effective in changing the behavior of providers or may not be fully implemented or fully funded by the government, which could cause a lack of demand for our products and services.\nWhile government programs have been initiated to improve the efficiency and quality of the healthcare sector, these programs may not be fully implemented or fully funded and there is no guarantee that our customers will receive any of these funds. Providers may also be slow to adopt EHR solutions in response to these government programs, may not select our products and services, or may decide not to implement an EHR system at all. Adoption of EHR technology imposes increased costs on providers and requires providers to spend time becoming familiar with its use. Any delay in the purchase of our EHR solutions and services in response to government programs, or the failure of providers to purchase an EHR solution, could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. It is also possible that Congress could repeal or not fund the HITECH Act as originally planned or otherwise amend it in a manner that would have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services and may result in a decrease in our revenues and market share.\nAs the healthcare industry evolves, changes in our customer base may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, the current trend toward consolidation of healthcare providers may cause our existing customer contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems or other healthcare organizations. Such larger healthcare organizations may have their own practice management, and EHR and RCM solutions, reducing demand for our services. If this trend continues, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our customer base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, which would result in a decrease in our revenues and market share.\nIf providers do not purchase our products and services or delay in choosing our products or services, we may not be able to grow our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to sell our products and services. Acceptance of our products and services may require providers to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information. Providers may not integrate our products and services into their workflow and may not accept our solutions and services as a replacement for traditional methods of practicing medicine. Providers may also choose to buy our competitors\u2019 products and services instead of ours. Achieving market acceptance for our solutions and services will continue to require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by providers. If providers fail to broadly accept our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf the revenues of our customers decrease, or if our customers cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.\nUnder most of our customer contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that our customer collects through the use of our services. Many factors may lead to decreases in customer revenue, including:\n\u00b7 reduction of customer revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services;\n\u00b7 failure of our customers to adopt or maintain effective business practices;\n\u00b7 actions by third-party payers of medical claims to reduce reimbursement;\n\u00b7 government regulations and government or other payer actions or inaction reducing or delaying reimbursement;\n\u00b7 interruption of customer access to our system; and\n\u00b7 our failure to provide services in a timely or high-quality manner.\nThe current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors. For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our customers. Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage. Added financial stress on our customers could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships. With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government healthcare programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicare, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our customers receive. If our customers\u2019 revenues decrease for any of the above or other reasons, or if our customers cancel or elect not to renew their contracts with us, our revenue will decrease.\nWe have incurred recent operating losses and net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability in the future.\nWe generated net losses of $4.5 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 include $2.5 million and $4.1 million of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, respectively.\nWe may not succeed in achieving the efficiencies we anticipate from future acquisitions, including moving sufficient labor to our offshore subsidiary to offset increased costs resulting from these acquisitions, and we may continue to incur losses in future periods. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as a public company and we intend to continue to increase our operating expenses as we grow our business. We also expect to continue to make investments in our proprietary technology, sales and marketing, infrastructure, facilities and other resources as we seek to grow, thereby incurring additional costs. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf our future losses exceed what we have planned, we might not comply with all the covenants in our credit facility with Opus Bank. This would give Opus Bank the ability to restrict future investments or dividend payments or otherwise constrain our business.\nAs a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we may be unable to recognize revenue from prospective customers on a timely basis and we may not be able to offset expenditures.\nThe sales cycle for our services can be variable, typically ranging from two to four months from initial contact with a potential customer to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer. During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources in an attempt to obtain a customer without recognizing revenue from that customer to offset such expenditures. Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from two to four months from contract execution to completion of implementation. Each customer\u2019s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of a failure by us or by the customer to meet our respective implementation responsibilities. During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services without recognizing revenue. Even following implementation, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts. In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process, and lost opportunity for implementing paying customers in that same period of time.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the products and services we sell in certain jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our products and services. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our products and services that we are currently not collecting could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with healthcare IT vendors not subject to sales and use taxes, and otherwise harm our business. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our products or services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.\nVendors of products and services like us are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our products or services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Nevertheless, customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our products and services going forward will effectively increase the cost of those products and services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the states in which such taxes are imposed.\nWe may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes. The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose the services of Mahmud Haq or other members of our management team, or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain other necessary employees, our business would be harmed.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain the members of our management team and other qualified personnel. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Mahmud Haq, our founder, principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer, who among other things, is instrumental in managing our offshore operations in Pakistan and coordinating those operations with our U.S. activities. The loss of Mr. Haq, who would be particularly difficult to replace, could negatively impact our ability to effectively manage our cost-effective workforce in Pakistan, which enables us to provide our products and solutions at attractive prices. Our future success also depends on the continued contributions of our other executive officers and certain key employees, each of whom may be difficult to replace, and upon our ability to attract and retain additional management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we compete for qualified personnel with other employers. We may face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring, integrating and training their replacements, and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to adequately establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. If we fail to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret law and contractual obligations to protect our key intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to help us maintain our position in the market and our competitive advantages.\nWe have no patents pending and none issued, and primarily rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology. Trade secrets may not be protectable if not properly kept confidential. We strive to enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors and business partners to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. However, the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use of our technology, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary technology. Moreover, others may reverse engineer or independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third-parties from using our intellectual property for their competitive advantage. Any such use could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Monitoring unauthorized uses of and enforcing our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly. Legal intellectual property actions are inherently uncertain and may not be successful, and may require a substantial amount of resources and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could force us to incur significant costs or revise the way we conduct our business.\nOur competitors protect their proprietary rights by means of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. We have not conducted an independent review of patents and other intellectual property issued to third-parties, who may have patents or patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We may receive letters from third parties alleging, or inquiring about, possible infringement, misappropriation or violation of their intellectual property rights. Any party asserting that we infringe, misappropriate or violate proprietary rights may force us to defend ourselves, and potentially our customers, against the alleged claim. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and/or invalidation of our proprietary rights or interruption or cessation of our operations. Any such claims or lawsuit could:\n\u00b7 be time-consuming and expensive to defend, whether meritorious or not;\n\u00b7 require us to stop providing products or services that use the technology that allegedly infringes the other party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u00b7 divert the attention of our technical and managerial resources;\n\u00b7 require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third-parties, which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable;\n\u00b7 prevent us from operating all or a portion of our business or force us to redesign our products, services or technology platforms, which could be difficult and expensive and may make the performance or value of our product or service offerings less attractive;\n\u00b7 subject us to significant liability for damages or result in significant settlement payments; or\n\u00b7 require us to indemnify our customers.\nFurthermore, during the course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. Disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect our business. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any litigation could significantly harm our relationships with current and prospective customers. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCurrent and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.\nWe may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees. Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients of our physician clients, or stockholders. Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.\nOur proprietary software or service delivery may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may encounter human or technical obstacles that prevent our proprietary applications from operating properly. If our applications do not function reliably or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain customers. We provide a limited warranty, have not paid warranty claims in the past, and do not have a reserve for warranty claims.\nMoreover, information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors. We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our products or services will not arise in the future. Errors may result from receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information or from interface of our services with legacy systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control. Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes. Because changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices. These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects or errors in our software might discourage existing or potential customers from purchasing our products and services. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, customers relying on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than customers of software products in general. We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist healthcare providers in tracking and treating patients. Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby create unforeseen liabilities for our business.\nOur customers or their patients may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our software or service processes. A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our service may be perceived as insecure, the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the web-based storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and patient information, including health, financial, payment and other personal or confidential information. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of such information. Because of the sensitivity of this information and due to requirements under applicable laws and regulations, the effectiveness of our security efforts is very important. We maintain servers, which store customers\u2019 data, including patient health records, in the U.S., Pakistan and Poland. We also process, transmit and store some data of our customers on servers and networks that are owned and controlled by third-party contractors in India and elsewhere. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, acts of terror, social unrest, employee error, malfeasance or for any other reasons, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to customer or patient data. Improper activities by third-parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our security systems. Our security measures may not be effective in preventing unauthorized access to the customer and patient data stored on our servers. If a breach of our security occurs, we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, possible lawsuits by individuals affected by the breach and significant remediation costs and efforts to prevent future occurrences. In addition, whether there is an actual or a perceived breach of our security, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose current or potential customers.\nOur products and services are required to meet the interoperability standards, which could require us to incur substantial additional development costs or result in a decrease in sales.\nOur customers and the industry leaders enacting regulatory requirements are concerned with and often require that our products and services be interoperable with other third-party healthcare information technology suppliers. Market forces or regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that would apply to our solutions, and if our products and services are not consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs. There currently exists a comprehensive set of criteria for the functionality, interoperability and security of various software modules in the healthcare information technology industry. However, those standards are subject to continuous modification and refinement. Achieving and maintaining compliance with industry interoperability standards and related requirements could result in larger than expected software development expenses and administrative expenses in order to conform to these requirements. These standards and specifications, once finalized, will be subject to interpretation by the entities designated to certify such technology. We will incur increased development costs in delivering solutions if we need to change or enhance our products and services to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. If our products and services are not consistent with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our solutions.\nDisruptions in Internet or telecommunication service or damage to our data centers could adversely affect our business by reducing our customers\u2019 confidence in the reliability of our services and products.\nOur information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including acts of God and other natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism and power losses, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses of and corruption of data and similar events. Our customers\u2019 data, including patient health records, reside on our own servers located in the U.S., Poland and Pakistan. Although we conduct business continuity planning to protect against fires, floods, other natural disasters and general business interruptions to mitigate the adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment at our data centers, the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to our customers. Any of these events could impair or prohibit our ability to provide our services, reduce the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, data centers, or systems that we interface with or utilize, including the internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks by third-parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. Any of these can cause system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, which can result in service disruptions. As a result, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear high up in the search results, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! to drive traffic from potential customers to our website. Although we employ search engine optimization techniques in an effort to increase traffic to our website, our ability to maintain high search result rankings is not entirely within our control. Our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, growth in our customer base could slow. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of potential customers directed to our website through search engines could harm our ability to grow our business and increase profitability.\nWe may be subject to liability for the content we provide to our customers and their patients.\nWe provide content for use by healthcare providers in treating patients. This content includes, among other things, patient education materials, coding and drug databases developed by third-parties, and prepopulated templates providers can use to document visits and record patient health information. If content in the third-party databases we use is incorrect or incomplete, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us. A court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed practitioners, or delivery of information by a third-party site that a consumer accesses through our solutions, exposes us to personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. Our liability insurance coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources.\nWe are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with customers and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.\nWe offer electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from customers, payers, and others. While we have implemented features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers. Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with customers and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.\nFailure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nOur clients are obligated by applicable law to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permission waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive. If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at December 31, 2015 as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at December 31, 2015 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s management has not completely remediated the previously disclosed material weakness in our internal controls related to the accounting for certain complex financial transactions, and the design and operating effectiveness of the financial reporting and closing process, in particular around information technology. Management\u2019s remediation efforts to date have included the hiring of additional accounting personnel and implementing additional controls and include upgrading our accounting system with multi-company and multi-currency capabilities, which became operational in January, 2016. Remediation efforts are expected to continue through 2016 until such time as management is able to conclude that its remediation efforts are operating and effective. These remediation efforts will include engaging an independent tax consultant to advise the Company on complex tax transactions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nWe may in the future identify other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in connection with our internal control over financial reporting. Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies that may be identified in the future will need to be addressed as part of our quarterly and annual evaluations of our internal controls over financial reporting under Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any future disclosures of a material weakness, or errors as a result of a material weakness, could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets and a decrease in the price of our Common and Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe are a party to several related-party agreements with our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mahmud Haq, which have significant contractual obligations. These agreements were not reviewed by our Audit Committee prior to their adoption and may not reflect terms that would be available from unaffiliated third parties.\nSince inception, we have entered into several related-party transactions with our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mahmud Haq, which subject us to significant contractual obligations. Since our audit committee was not formed until February 14, 2014, these related party transactions were not reviewed by our audit committee prior to their adoption, whose charter prescribes procedures for the review and approval of related party transactions. Although we believe these transactions reflect terms comparable to those that would be available from third parties, and the audit committee has now reviewed these arrangements, the lack of prior review of these transactions by our independent audit committee may have caused us to enter into agreements with Mr. Haq that we may not otherwise have entered into or upon terms less favorable to us than we may have obtained from unaffiliated third parties.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and is constantly evolving due to the changing political, legislative, regulatory landscape and other factors. Many healthcare laws, including the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate or address the services that we provide. Further, healthcare laws differ from state to state and it is difficult to ensure that our business, products and services comply with evolving laws in all states. By way of example, certain federal and state laws forbid billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with healthcare providers. These laws vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal laws governing these relationships, known as the Stark Law, is very complex in its application. Similarly, many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations, as well as laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others. Other federal and state laws restrict assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs, the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and the methodology under which business services companies may be compensated for such services.\nThe Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) has a longstanding concern that percentage-based billing arrangements may increase the risk of improper billing practices. In addition, certain states have adopted laws or regulations forbidding splitting of fees with non-physicians which may be interpreted to prevent business service providers, including medical billing providers, from using a percentage-based billing arrangement. The OIG and HHS recommend that medical billing companies develop and implement comprehensive compliance programs to mitigate this risk. While we have developed and implemented a comprehensive billing compliance program that we believe is consistent with these recommendations, our failure to ensure compliance with controlling legal requirements, accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business and contracting model, or other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider proposals to revise aspects of the healthcare industry or to revise or create additional statutory and regulatory requirements. For instance, certain computer software products are regulated as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sometimes chosen to disclaim authority to, or to refrain from actively regulating certain software products which are similar to our products, this area of medical device regulation remains in flux. We expect that the FDA will continue to be active in exploring legal regimes for regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings. Any additional regulation can be expected to impose additional overhead costs on us and should we fail to adequately meet these legal obligations, we could face potential regulatory action. Regulatory authorities such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) may also impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing technologies. If implemented, proposals like these could impact our operations, the use of our services and our ability to market new services, or could create unexpected liabilities for us. We cannot predict what changes to laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or our operating costs.\nIf we do not maintain the certification of our EHR solutions pursuant to the HITECH Act, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe HITECH Act provides financial incentives for healthcare providers that demonstrate \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of EHR and mandates use of health information technology systems that are certified according to technical standards developed under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HITECH Act also imposes certain requirements upon governmental agencies to use, and requires healthcare providers, health plans, and insurers contracting with such agencies to use, systems that are certified according to such standards. Such standards and implementation specifications that are being developed under the HITECH Act includes named standards, architectures, and software schemes for the authentication and security of individually identifiable health information and the creation of common solutions across disparate entities.\nThe HITECH Act\u2019s certification requirements affect our business because we have invested and continue to invest in conforming our products and services to these standards. HHS has developed certification programs for electronic health records and health information exchanges. Our web-based EHR solution has been certified as a complete EHR by ICSA Labs, a non-governmental, independent certifying body, which indicates that our EHR solutions meet the 2014 criteria to support Stage 2 \u201cmeaningful use\u201d as required by HHS to assist providers in their efforts to meet the goals and objectives of \u201cmeaningful use,\u201d making such providers eligible for funding under the HITECH Act if our EHR is used appropriately. However, Stage 2 only refers to the second set of \u201cmeaningful use\u201d objectives that must be met to be eligible for incentive payments. Stage 3 requirements are still being finalized. We may need to use additional resources to meet the newly defined requirements, which could lead to delays necessary to modify our solutions. We must ensure that our EHR solutions continue to be certified according to applicable HITECH Act technical standards so that our customers qualify for \u201cmeaningful use\u201d incentive payments. Failure to maintain this certification under the HITECH Act could jeopardize our relationships with customers who are relying upon us to provide certified software, and will make our products and services less attractive to customers than the offerings of other EHR vendors who maintain certification of their products.\nIf we do not maintain the EHNAC certification of the clearinghouse service, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe clearinghouse software has been certified to be compliant with EHNAC certification specifications. The certification must be renewed annually and is subject to recertification every two years. The current certification expires in March 2017. If the Company was not able to renew the EHNAC certification, there could be revenue loss as customers who insist on this certification may terminate.\nIf a breach of our measures protecting personal data covered by HIPAA or the HITECH Act occurs, we may incur significant liabilities.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), and the regulations that have been issued under it contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use, collection, storage and disclosure of individuals\u2019 protected health information. Under HIPAA, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf. In February 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to add provisions that impose certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security requirements directly upon business associates of covered entities. Under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, our customers are covered entities and we are a business associate of our customers as a result of our contractual obligations to perform certain services for those customers. The HITECH Act transferred enforcement authority of the security rule from CMS to the Office for Civil Rights of HHS, thereby consolidating authority over the privacy and security rules under a single office within HHS. Further, HITECH empowered state attorneys general to enforce HIPAA.\nThe HITECH Act heightened enforcement of privacy and security rules, indicating that the imposition of penalties will be more common in the future and such penalties will be more severe. For example, the HITECH Act requires that the HHS fully investigate all complaints if a preliminary investigation of the facts indicates a possible violation due to \u201cwillful neglect\u201d and imposes penalties if such neglect is found. Further, where our liability as a business associate to our customers was previously merely contractual in nature, the HITECH Act now treats the breach of duty under an agreement by a business associate to carry the same liability as if the covered entity engaged in the breach. In other words, as a business associate, we are now directly responsible for complying with HIPAA. We may find ourselves subject to increased liability as a possible liable party and we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our customers under our agreements with them.\nFinally, regulations also require business associates to notify covered entities, who in turn must notify affected individuals and government authorities of data security breaches involving unsecured protected health information. We have performed an assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic health information. In response to this risk analysis, we implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any security incidents. If we knowingly breach the HITECH Act\u2019s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties (up to $1.5 million for identical incidences) and the possibility of civil litigation.\nIf we or our customers fail to comply with federal and state laws governing submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs and financial relationships among healthcare providers, we or our customers may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and relationships, and those of our customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state and local governmental entities. The impact of these regulations can adversely affect us even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations. We must ensure that our products and services can be used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. Inability of our customers to do so could affect the marketability of our products and services or our compliance with our customer contracts, or even expose us to direct liability under the theory that we had assisted our customers in a violation of healthcare laws or regulations. A number of federal and state laws, including anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims, apply to healthcare providers and others that make, offer, seek or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and, in some instances, any private program. These laws are complex and their application to our specific services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have recently increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other healthcare reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry receive inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with government investigations. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted by these efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could give our customers the right to terminate our contracts with us and result in significant harm to our business and financial condition.\nThese laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Any failure of our products or services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal liability and could, among other things, adversely affect demand for our services, invalidate all or portions of some of our contracts with our customers, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our revenue, cause us to be disqualified from serving customers doing business with government payers, and give our customers the right to terminate our contracts with them, any one of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nPotential healthcare reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our products and services could increase our costs, delay or prevent our introduction of new products or services, and impair the function or value of our existing products and services.\nOur products and services may be significantly impacted by healthcare reform initiatives and will be subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could negatively impact our business in a multitude of ways. If substantive healthcare reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our products and services to comply. Reform or changing regulatory requirements may also render our products or services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new products or services. This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop or modify our products and services. For example, the conversion to the ICD-10-CM standard for coding medical diagnoses will likely cause significant disruption to our industry and consume a large amount of our resources. Such reforms may also make introduction of new products and service more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. These changes may also prevent our introduction of new products and services or make the continuation or maintenance of our existing products and services unprofitable or impossible.\nAdditional regulation of the disclosure of medical information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.\nFederal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of medical information. Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States. Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our servers in Pakistan or Poland for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive. Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.\nOur services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees.\nAmong other things, our services from time to time involve handling mail from payers and from patients for our customers, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency. Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds. The manner in which we store and use certain financial information is governed by various federal and state laws. If any of our employees takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, subject to regulatory actions and penalties, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed. In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nThe market for our common stock may not provide adequate liquidity.\nThe public market for our common stock has limited trading volume. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of a more active trading market in our common stock, or how liquid that market might be. If an active market does not develop, investors may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet investor expectations, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nVariations in our quarterly and year-end operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. If our sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Specific factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u00b7 demand and pricing for our products and services;\n\u00b7 government or commercial healthcare reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 physician and patient acceptance of any of our current or future products;\n\u00b7 introduction of competing products;\n\u00b7 our operating expenses which fluctuate due to growth of our business;\n\u00b7 timing and size of any new product or technology acquisitions we may complete; and\n\u00b7 Variable sales cycle and implementation periods for our products and services.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nMahmud Haq currently controls 44.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which will prevent investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nMahmud Haq, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns 44.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Mr. Haq exercises a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management, and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without his support, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law, of our amended and restated charter and amended and restated bylaws may make a takeover more difficult, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and in the Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt, which is opposed by management and the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. We have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the removal of a director only for cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 50.1% of the outstanding shares entitled to cast their vote for the election of directors, which may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. These and other anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors. Such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our Series A Preferred Stock in the future.\nAny issuance of additional preferred stock in the future may dilute the rights of our existing stockholders.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, privileges and other terms of these shares of which 231,616 shares were issued in our offering of Series A Preferred Stock. Our board of directors may exercise its authority with respect to the remaining shares of preferred stock without any further approval of stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of preferred stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nCurrently, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be a stockholder\u2019s sole source of gain.\nComplying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies will increase our costs and the demands on management and could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we elected to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, when our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be additional material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our Company may suffer if further deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common and preferred stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal control from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common and Series A Preferred Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are and we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, will therefore be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common and Series A Preferred Stock less attractive because we rely on some of the exemptions available to us under the JOBS Act. If some investors find our Common and Series A Preferred Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common and Series A Preferred Stock and our respective stock prices may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.\nWe depend on key information systems and third party service providers.\nWe depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. These systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or supplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information, disrupting business processes or corrupting information. These risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Shares of Our Preferred Stock\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Also, the Series A Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. We have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. At December 31, 2015, our total liabilities (excluding contingent consideration) equaled approximately $10.6 million.\nCertain of our existing or future debt instruments may restrict the authorization, payment or setting apart of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our Credit Agreement with Opus Bank restricts the payment of dividends in the event of any event of default, including failure to meet certain financial covenants. Further, existing and future debt instruments have senior claims to the separate bank account we established with funds to cover two years of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that we will always remain in compliance with the Opus Credit Agreement, and if we default, we may be contractually prohibited from paying dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and amounts in the separate bank account we established may be depleted if such a default occurred. Also, future offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Preferred Stock and may result in dilution to owners of the Series A Preferred Stock. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings, which may reduce the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock and will dilute the value of their holdings in us.\nThe trading market for the Series A preferred stock may not provide investors with adequate liquidity.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. However, the trading market for the Series A Preferred Stock may not be maintained and may not provide investors with adequate liquidity. The liquidity of the market for the Series A Preferred Stock depends on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, our financial condition and operating results, the number of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Series A Preferred Stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will maintain the trading market in our Series A Preferred Stock, or how liquid that market will be. If an active market is not maintained, investors may have difficulty selling shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that rank on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation or voting rights.\nWe are allowed to issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to or above the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs pursuant to our articles of incorporation and the articles of amendment relating to the Series A Preferred Stock without any vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the Series A Preferred Stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and other classes or series of stock with equal priority with respect to dividends.\nAlso, although holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to limited voting rights, as described in the prospectus section entitled \u201cDescription of the Series A Preferred Stock-Voting Rights,\u201d with respect to the circumstances under which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Series A Preferred Stock votes separately as a class along with all other series of our preferred stock that we may issue upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. As a result, the voting rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock may be significantly diluted, and the holders of such other series of preferred stock that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any vote.\nFuture issuances and sales of senior or pari passu preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series A Preferred Stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nMarket interest rates may materially and adversely affect the value of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of the Series A Preferred Stock is the dividend yield on the Series A Preferred Stock (as a percentage of the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A Preferred Stock to expect a higher dividend yield (and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for dividend payments). Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock to materially decrease.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock requires us to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital, and to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business and meet the covenants in our credit agreement with Opus Bank.\nFurther, notwithstanding these factors, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in the Series A Preferred Stock prospectus or documents incorporated by reference in that prospectus, were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock, if any, and preferred stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d.\nDistributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not currently have accumulated earnings and profits. Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d If any distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock might decline.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet investor expectations, which may cause the price of our Series A Preferred Stock to decline.\nVariations in our quarterly and year-end operating results are difficult to predict and our income and cash flow may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which may impact our board of directors\u2019 willingness or legal ability to declare a monthly dividend. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Series A Preferred Stock could decline substantially. Specific factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u00b7 demand and pricing for our products and services;\n\u00b7 government or commercial healthcare reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 physician and patient acceptance of any of our current or future products;\n\u00b7 introduction of competing products;\n\u00b7 our operating expenses which fluctuate due to growth of our business;\n\u00b7 timing and size of any new product or technology acquisitions we may complete; and\n\u00b7 variable sales cycle and implementation periods for our products and services.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated.\nWe have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Also, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward, placed on a watch list or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision, placing on a watch list or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn or after November 4, 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Also, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined in the Series A Preferred Stock prospectus, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred. We may have an incentive to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock. If we redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock depends on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u00b7 prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7 trading prices of similar securities;\n\u00b7 our history of timely dividend payments;\n\u00b7 the annual yield from dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u00b7 general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7 government action or regulation;\n\u00b7 the financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors in our industry;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nA holder of Series A Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock are limited. Our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights, and Mahmud Haq, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 45% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Mr. Haq exercises a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management, and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without his support, which in turn could reduce the price of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nVoting rights for holders of the Series A Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect, voting together with the holders of any other series of our preferred stock having similar voting rights, two additional directors to our board of directors, subject to limitations described in the prospectus section entitled \u201cDescription of the Series A Preferred Stock-Voting Rights,\u201d in the event that eighteen monthly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our articles of incorporation or articles of amendment relating to the Series A Preferred Stock that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or authorize, increase or create additional classes or series of our capital stock that are senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Other than the limited circumstances described in the prospectus and except to the extent required by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights. Please see the section in the prospectus entitled \u201cDescription of the Series A Preferred Stock-Voting Rights.\u201d\nIf our common stock is delisted, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock does not contain provisions that are intended to protect investors if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Since the Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, investors may be forced to hold shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and receive stated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof. Also, if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, it is likely that the Series A Preferred Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market as well. Accordingly, if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of the common stock increases.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into the common stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock. The market value of the Series A Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series A Preferred Stock.", "PERMNO": 14818, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MTBC"}
