{"cik": "1135657", "company": "Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. You could lose part or all of your investment. You should bear in mind, in reviewing this Form 10-K, that past experience is no indication of future performance. You should read the section titled \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited operating history and only minimum revenues.\nWe have a limited operating history and, accordingly, we are subject to substantial risks inherent in the commencement of a new business enterprise. We are a technology-driven independent oilfield service company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry with a focus on improving the ecological and economic aspects of the process. Our primary focus will be on the most active shale and unconventional oil and natural gas basins. We have commenced operations in Argentina and since 2014 through December 31, 2016, have only generated minimal revenue from our consulting and field management operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully generate additional revenues or attain operating profitability. Additionally, we have a very limited business history that investors can analyze to aid them in making an informed judgment as to the merits of an investment in our Company. Any investment in our Company should be considered a high-risk investment because the investor will be placing funds at risk in our Company with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, and other problems to which new ventures are often subjected. Investors should not invest in our Company unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. As we are early in the revenue-generation process, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in establishing a new business in a highly competitive industry.\nWe have limited sources of liquidity.\nWe require substantial capital to pursue our operating strategy. As we have limited internal sources of liquidity, we will continue to rely on external sources for liquidity for the foreseeable future.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry, and we may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We have substantial future capital requirements, including the need to fund growth through acquisition of additional equipment and assets, working capital and capital expenditures and debt service obligations. Since December 2013, our operation and growth has been funded primarily by proceeds from various equity and debt offerings and more recently by cash flows from operations. Our ability to fund future operations and our planned and committed 2017 capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. The availability of financing will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, market conditions in the exploration and production industry and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to continue growing our business or to sustain or increase our current level of profitability. Our inability to grow our business may adversely impact our ability to sustain or improve our profits. Moreover, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may not be able to fulfill, renew or replace our existing agreements on attractive terms or at all, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully fulfill, renew or replace our existing agreements with new agreements on or prior to their expiration on terms satisfactory to us or the operator or that we will be able to continue to provide services under those existing agreements without service interruption. We are dependent on entering into additional service agreements to grow our business. If we are not able to either renew or enter into additional service agreements, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an emerging growth company, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities and our geographic coverage through both organic growth and acquisitions, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the oilfield services industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan.\nIf our intended expansion of our business is not successful, our financial condition, profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may not achieve increases in revenue and profitability that we hope to realize.\nA key element of our business strategy involves the expansion of our services, geographic presence and customer base. These aspects of our strategy are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf an inability to retain or hire experienced crews and other personnel;\n\u25cf a lack of customer demand for the services we intend to provide;\n\u25cf an inability to secure necessary equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants) or technology to successfully execute our expansion plans;\n\u25cf shortages of water used in our sand processing operations and our hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u25cf unanticipated delays that could limit or defer the provision of services by us and jeopardize our relationships with existing customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers for such services; and\n\u25cf competition from new and existing services providers.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in implementing our planned expansion could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize.\nOur liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur future indebtedness, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf our debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u25cf any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u25cf our level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to maintain pricing on our core services.\nPressures stemming from fluctuating market conditions and oil and natural gas prices are making it increasingly difficult to maintain the pricing on our core services during the last quarter of 2015 and throughout 2016. We have faced, and will likely continue to face, reductions in our services being needed as well as pricing pressure from the competitors who are also competing for those same opportunities during 2017. If we are unable to maintain pricing on our core services, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nThe activity level of our customers, spending for our products and services, and payment patterns may be impacted by low commodity prices and any deterioration in the credit markets.\nMany of our potential customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Beginning in late 2014 and continuing through 2015 and into early 2016, there was a significant decline in the word-wide benchmarked prices of oil and gas, resulting in reduced cash flow from our customers\u2019 operations and a severe reduction in their access to the equity and credit markets. Additionally, during 2015 and 2016, many of our potential customers\u2019 equity values substantially declined. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our potential customers\u2019 spending for our products and services. Although during 2016 the price of WTI oil has increased to the mid $50s per barrel, drilling activity has increased modestly attributable to concerns about sustained price stability and price maintenance.\nIn addition, the same factors that may lead to a reduction in our potential customers\u2019 spending also may increase the exposure to the risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the customers. A significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity may result in a decrease in their ability to pay or otherwise perform their obligations to us. Any increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, either as a result of recent changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on the operating results and adversely affect the liquidity.\nIn addition to the foregoing, because YPF is controlled by the Argentine state, its capital spending and other policies may be subject to political influence, particularly from the Secretary of Energy. Because we rely on a limited number of customers for the well stimulation services, the change in ownership and management of any such customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleet, expanding the amount of well stimulation equipment they currently own or using alternative technologies for enhancing oil and gas production.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleets in lieu of using our well stimulation services. In addition, there are other technologies available for the artificial enhancement of oil and natural gas production and our customers may elect to use these alternative technologies instead of the well stimulation services we provide. Such vertical integration, increases in vertical integration or use of alternative technologies could result in decreased demand for our well stimulation services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry, and loss of a significant customer or the existing customer contracts could cause our revenue to decline substantially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is and will be highly dependent on existing agreements and the relationships with potential customers and technology partners. Revenues from these potential customers and revenues from joint ventures are expected to represent a substantial portion of our total future revenues. A reduction in business from any of these arrangements resulting from reduced demand for their own products and services, a work stoppage, sourcing of products from other suppliers or other factors could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the inability of suppliers to timely deliver the required equipment for the new well stimulation fleets could have a material adverse impact on our ability to perform under the existing agreements. We expect that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. Our existing agreements do not obligate any of those prospective customers to use our products and services. In addition, the existing agreements contain provisions whereby the customers may terminate the agreement in the event we are unable to perform under the terms of the contract or make adjustments to service and/or materials fees payable thereunder based on changing market conditions. The existing agreements are also subject to termination by customers under certain circumstances, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have highly sophisticated systems to forecast our future revenue or profitability and therefore could experience difficulty in managing our growth and associated working capital needs.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends on the availability of water.\nWell stimulation, and pressure pumping more generally, can require a significant supply of water, and water supply and quality are important requirements to our operations. We intend to meet our water requirements from sources on or near the well sites, but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of water from sources in these areas, some of which are prone to drought. For example, in December 2016, the Neuqu\u00e9n province in Argentina declared a 12-month state of emergency as a result of a severe drought. In response to this emergency, the Governor of Neuqu\u00e9n also established a special committee with broad powers to take any \u201curgent and immediate action deemed necessary to address the water emergency.\u201d While we cannot predict what measures may be taken in response to drought conditions, limitations on water use or increased costs to obtain water from alternative sources has the potential to adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.\nAny indebtedness we incur could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe anticipate securing growth capital through lease financing or other long-term financing arrangements. Our expected future needs for financing for equipment acquisition and working capital may adversely affect operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on our indebtedness as such payments become due.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways.\nWe and Fir Tree are parties to the A&R Note Agreement. The A&R Note Agreement contains restrictive covenants. These covenants include, but are not limited to, requirements to reserve shares issuable for payment of the outstanding balance on the convertible note, maintain specific account balances, and comply with the operating budget. Additionally, the covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on incurring certain types of additional debt, engaging in transactions with affiliates, selling assets, making unapproved capital expenditures and entering into certain lease agreements.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our note facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our convertible note facility, Fir Tree may accelerate payment under the A&R Note Agreement in accordance with its terms. If we were unable to repay those amounts, Fir Tree could, among other things, proceed against the collateral granted to them that secures that indebtedness.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets as collateral under our note facility. If Fir Tree accelerates the repayment of borrowings under our note facility, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay indebtedness under such facilities and our other indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry, and the competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. We compete with small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis. We also compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Our initial well stimulation fleet currently does not have sufficient HHP to enable us to participate in unconventional jobs as well as larger well stimulation jobs. See Part I - Item 1 - \u201cBusiness-Market Segmentation.\u201d\nThe inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring and integrating businesses in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue selected acquisitions or mergers. If we choose to grow our business through acquisitions or mergers, it is possible that companies acquired or merged into our Company may have associated risks including:\n\u25cf Unanticipated costs and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities;\n\u25cf Inherent difficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and personnel;\n\u25cf Potential losses of key employees and customers of the acquired business;\n\u25cf Internal control weaknesses or limitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business, in order to comply with public reporting requirements;\n\u25cf Risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf Increases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain specialized equipment from suppliers and key raw materials on a timely basis.\nIf our current suppliers are unable to provide the necessary raw materials (including, for example, proppant and chemicals) or finished products (such as the new equipment) or otherwise fail to deliver products timely and in quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the past few years, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with pressure pumping operations, requiring work stoppages that adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors.\nThe Chairman of the Board allocates part of his time to other companies.\nMr. Bjarte Bruheim, the chairman of the Board, is also a member of the board of directors of other companies. Mr. Bruheim allocates his time between the affairs of Eco-Stim and the affairs of these other companies. This situation presents the potential for a conflict of interest for Mr. Bruheim in determining the respective percentages of his time to be devoted to the affairs of Eco-Stim and the affairs of others. In addition, if the affairs of these other companies require him to devote more substantial amounts of his time to the affairs of the other companies in the future, it could limit his ability to devote sufficient time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our business.\nUnexpected equipment malfunctions, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to decreased revenue and reduce our cash flows.\nOur performance is primarily dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our sole pressure pumping fleet, which commenced operation in Argentina in December 2014, and our sole coiled tubing equipment unit, which commenced operation in Argentina in February 2015. If our operation of such core equipment experiences unanticipated disruption due to an accident, mechanical failure or other unforeseen event such as a fire, explosion, violent weather conditions or unexpected operational difficulties, or if we have to schedule a temporary shutdown to perform maintenance on any of our core equipment, our ability to provide timely services to our customers could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption in supply of certain key raw materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently anticipate sourcing materials, such as guar gum, from one supplier. Given the limited number of suppliers of such key raw materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements should our suppliers fail to timely deliver these key raw materials. Any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in implementing technology development and enhancements.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues could be materially and adversely affected and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment and facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive and our business and revenues could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nThe management of our Company is important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating the business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, and identifying expansion opportunities. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our management. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters.\nThe petroleum and oil-service industries in Argentina, where we operate, and other countries are unionized, and it is likely that we may experience work stoppages or other labor disruptions from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 86% of our Argentine employees were represented by unions and they are working under the conditions stated in their collective bargaining agreements. No assurance can be given that the collective bargaining agreements will be successfully extended or renegotiated as they expire from time to time. If any collective bargaining agreement is not extended or renegotiated, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our combined results of operations and financial condition by disrupting our ability to perform well stimulation or pressure pumping and other services for the customers under our service contracts.\nIf we become subject to warranty, similar claims or litigation, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nErrors, defects or other performance problems in the products that we sell or services that we offer could result in our customers seeking damages from us for losses associated with these errors, defects or other performance problems.\nOur business involves certain operating risks and our insurance coverage or proceeds, if any, may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations.\nThe technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant worker health, safety and environmental risks. Our services involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving our services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance policies may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of countries, including those where we do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $43.7 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which begin to expire in 2018. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, subject to certain adjustments. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We may have previously experienced and may in the future experience one or more \u201cownership changes\u201d. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We believe that, due to our subsequent event noted in Note 19 regarding the Fir Tree transaction, we will have an impact due to the change in control, however, we have not yet evaluated the impact this will have on us.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Argentina and Other Foreign Jurisdictions\nOur business is largely dependent upon economic conditions in Argentina.\nSubstantially all our initial operations and customers are located in Argentina, and, as a result, our business is to a large extent dependent upon economic conditions prevailing in Argentina. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in past decades, including numerous periods of low or negative growth and high and variable levels of inflation and devaluation. Argentina\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average annual real rate of approximately 0.8% in 2012, recovering to 2.9% in 2013. In January, 2017 , the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos, or INDEC), which is the only institution in Argentina with the statutory power to produce official nationwide statistics, reported real gross domestic product during the third quarter of 2016 was 3.6% lower than the comparable figure for 2015. If economic conditions in Argentina continue to contract, or if the Argentine government\u2019s measures to attract or retain foreign investment and international financing in the future are unsuccessful, such developments could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nArgentine economic results are dependent on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\u25cf international demand for Argentina\u2019s principal exports;\n\u25cf international prices for Argentina\u2019s principal commodity exports;\n\u25cf stability and competitiveness of the Argentine Peso against foreign currencies;\n\u25cf levels of consumer consumption and foreign and domestic investment and financing; and\n\u25cf the rate of inflation.\nIn recent years, Argentina has confronted inflationary pressure. According to inflation data published by INDEC, in January 2017, the Argentine consumer price index increased by 1.3 % from the prior month. Increased rates of inflation in Argentina could increase our cost of operation, and may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that inflation rates will not be higher in the future.\nIn addition, Argentina\u2019s economy is vulnerable to adverse developments affecting its principal trading partners. A significant decline in the economic growth of any of Argentina\u2019s major trading partners, such as Brazil, China or the U.S., could have a material adverse impact on Argentina\u2019s balance of trade and adversely affect Argentina\u2019s economic growth and may consequently adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The Argentine Peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future, consequently affecting our financial condition and results of operations (see additionally Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\u201d). President Macri moved quickly in December 2015 after taking office to lift currency controls. This was effective at removing the large spread that previously existed between the so-called \u201cblue market\u201d rate of approximately 14 pesos to 1 dollar and the official exchange rate of 9 pesos to 1 dollar. Since currency controls were repealed, the Argentine Peso has traded between around 11.4 pesos to the U.S. dollar and 15.8 Argentine pesos to the U.S. dollar, and we believe is currently reasonably stable.\nMoreover, this move was accompanied by a liberalization of capital controls, which we expect to improve the investment climate in Argentina by making it easier for our Company and our customers to repatriate future earnings in Argentina. However, this move could stall or reverse its favorable trend.\nThe Argentinian government has fixed oil and gas prices for domestic producers. Any decrease or removal of the fixed price could result in a corresponding reduction in our customers\u2019 drilling activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Argentinian government has historically fixed the price of natural gas production for light sweet crude and for heavy oil. More recently, the government has been supportive of fixed prices for natural gas but has indicated a desire to allow the crude oil prices to adjust to international prices. We have no assurance that the government will not lower the fixed prices for natural gas in the future or remove them altogether. If the fixed price for natural gas were to be reduced or removed, our customers may drill less, which could have a corresponding effect on the demand for our products or services.\nCertain risks are inherent in any investment in a company operating in an emerging market such as Argentina.\nArgentina is an emerging market economy and investing in emerging markets generally carries risks. These risks include political, social and economic instability that may affect Argentina\u2019s economic results which can stem from many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf high interest rates;\n\u25cf abrupt changes in currency values;\n\u25cf high levels of inflation;\n\u25cf exchange controls;\n\u25cf wage and price controls;\n\u25cf regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations;\n\u25cf changes in governmental economic or tax policies; and\n\u25cf political and social tensions.\nAny of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Argentine economy has been adversely affected by economic developments in other markets.\nFinancial and securities markets in Argentina, and the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. Considering the current international turmoil, Argentina\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including those relating to or similar to the global economic crisis that began in 2008 and the recent uncertainties surrounding European sovereign debt. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors\u2019 perceptions of events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and investments in securities from issuers in other countries, including Argentina.\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that the Argentine financial system and securities markets will not continue to be adversely affected by events in developed countries\u2019 economies or events in other emerging markets, which could in turn, adversely affect the Argentine economy and, as a consequence, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new export duties, other taxes and import regulations could adversely affect our results.\nIn 2012, the Argentine government adopted an import procedure pursuant to which local authorities must pre-approve any import of products and services to Argentina as a precondition to allow importers access to the foreign exchange market for the payment of such imported products and services.\nWe cannot assure you that these taxes and import regulations will not continue or be increased in the future or that other new taxes or import regulations will not be imposed.\nWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nOur results of operations are exposed to currency fluctuation and any devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar and other hard currencies may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The value of the Argentine Peso has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, the value of the Argentine Peso may further depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar and how any such fluctuations would affect our business.\nWe are subject to exchange and capital controls.\nIn the past, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. Although the Macri government lifted exchange controls and liberalized capital controls as described above, there can be no assurances regarding future modifications to exchange and capital controls. Exchange and capital controls could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations and execute our financing plans.\nOperating internationally subjects us to significant risks and regulations inherent in operating in foreign countries.\nWe plan to conduct operations in a number of countries. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets, including the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf government instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential clients to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u25cf potential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets, such as the 2015 nationalization of Repsol S.A.\u2019s interest in YPF;\n\u25cf difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, import/export tariffs and quotas;\n\u25cf civil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u25cf availability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy that limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u25cf decrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u25cf terrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nCertain of the equipment that we use in certain foreign countries may require prior U.S. government approval in the form of an export license and may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions. The delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in fines and other penalties.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns will be subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as an international company depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur international operations involve the use of foreign currencies, which subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations, difficulty in repatriating foreign currencies and other currency risks.\nWe and our foreign subsidiaries from time to time will hold foreign currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations will subject us to currency risk as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations. In the future, we could experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the U.S., and there can be no assurance that payments received in foreign currencies can be repatriated to the U.S. or that we will be able, contractually or otherwise, to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nAs a company subject to compliance with the FCPA, our business may suffer and we may be subject to competitive disadvantages because our efforts to comply with U.S. laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to U.S. law. Additionally, our business plan involves establishing close relationships with stakeholders in certain foreign markets. Any determination that we or foreign shareholders, directors or officer\u2019s partners have violated the FCPA may adversely affect our business and operations.\nViolations of anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nWe may face intense competition in our industry and in the markets where we operate.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive, and most of our potential competitors will have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive services or substantially decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to compete effectively. Some of these competitors may expand or construct newer, more powerful or more flexible well stimulation fleets that would create additional competition for us. Furthermore, recent reduction in drilling activity in markets such as North America may drive other oilfield services companies to relocate their equipment to the regions in which we operate or intend to operate. Such increase in supply relative to demand could negatively impact pricing and utilization of our services. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets served or proposed to be served by us, that we will be able to compete successfully, or that we will have adequate funds to compete.\nBecause the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, our operating results may fluctuate.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Fluctuations in such prices may result in a decrease in the expenditure levels of oil and natural gas companies, which in turn may adversely affect us. For example, the substantial and extended decrease in commodity prices which started in 2014 and continuing through early 2016 has severely reduced most of our customer\u2019s profitability. This situation may continue or worsen and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as delays in obtaining permits by the customers for their operations, such as for well stimulation and pressure pumping, or by us for our operations, could impair our business.\nOur operations and the operations of the customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which the operations are located. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including well stimulation, our operations or the operations of our customers could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations, and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing areas, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u25cf the ability of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) (and certain non-OPEC countries) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf the level of global exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the level of global inventories;\n\u25cf prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u25cf the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u25cf localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u25cf the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u25cf weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf expectations about future commodity prices; and\n\u25cf domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. The prices of crude oil, domestic natural gas and NGLs have declined substantially since June 2014. The price of WTI crude oil has decreased from over $100.00 per barrel in the middle of June 2014 to below $30.00 per barrel in January and February 2016. Henry Hub spot prices for natural gas declined below $1.80 per Mcf in December 2015 compared to more than $4.40 per Mcf in January 2014. The volatility in gas pricing was demonstrated in 2016 when in April and May, the average price was $1.92 per Mcf while the year ended with a December average of $3.59 per Mcf. The current downturn in the oil and gas industry has resulted in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and environmental risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe are a provider of well stimulation and pressure pumping services, a process involving the injection of fluids-typically consisting mostly of water and also including several chemical additives-as well as sand in order to create fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well. In addition, we provide a range of services to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, consisting of, among other things, coiled tubing services. Risks inherent to our industry create the potential for significant losses associated with damage to the environment or natural resources, such as the potential for contamination of drinking water resources.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, worker health and safety laws and regulations that may subject us to substantial liability or require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and liability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. We could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these and other environmental laws. Such liability can be on a strict, joint and several liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they are likely to change in the future. If existing environmental requirements or enforcement policies change and become more stringent, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and natural gas.\nIn recent years, many national, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in the United States, the EPA has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions including carbon dioxide and methane. In December 2015, the United States and Argentina participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At this time, we cannot predict what additional steps, if any, the U.S. and Argentina may take as a result of participation in the Paris Agreement. Argentina has also passed a number of energy-efficiency related measures as well as requirements for the blending of ethanol and other biofuels with petroleum fuels. These measures could reduce demands for petroleum products, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our services and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather. At this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. If competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future that are more efficient or productive than ours, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe industry is affected by excess equipment inventory levels.\nBecause of the long-life nature of oilfield service equipment and the lag between when a decision to build additional equipment is made and when the equipment is placed into service, the inventory of oilfield service equipment in the industry does not always correlate with the level of demand for service equipment.\nCompliance with governmental regulations may impact our or our customers\u2019 operations and may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operations are dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and well stimulation and pressure pumping, improve total recovery, but they also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulations in the future.\nAccess to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced. This could lead our customers to curtail their operations and result in a decrease in demand for our services, which in turn could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAny of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to well stimulation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our operations or the operations of our customers.\nMany national, provincial, and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using well stimulation, which is part of the overall services we provide to our customers. Well stimulation is a treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. In response to concerns related to potential impacts to the environment and natural resources from well stimulation, governmental authorities have issued new rules and regulations governing the practice, and are also pursuing studies related to its potential effects. Also, some national, state, and local governments have adopted bans or other measures restricting well stimulation activities. For example, the Province of Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina where we operate, has approved a set of rules regarding the extraction of shale oil and gas. These rules require, amongst other things, that operators performing well stimulation obtain permits prior to commencing drilling activities and file reports with the provincial government regarding the chemicals used in the well stimulation process and an analysis of the flowback water returning to the surface. In certain regions, the indigenous people have voiced their opposition to the increased shale development although to date these protests have been peaceful and have yet to disrupt activity in a meaningful way. In addition, several other provinces and local governments have voted to ban well stimulation within their borders, and some groups continue to advocate for a national ban on well stimulation in Argentina. The EPA and states, including Oklahoma, have also taken steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Legislative or regulatory changes could cause us or our customers to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential national, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nFuture well stimulation-related legislation or regulations that further restrict or prohibit such activities could lead to operational delays and increased costs for our operations or the operations of our customers. Any adverse impacts on the operations of our customers could in turn reduce demand for our services. If such additional legislation or regulations are enacted and implemented, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with most, but not all, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC. Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to these requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to issue an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. In addition, our registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or costlier for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, the committees of our Board, and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nCompliance with Section 404 of the SOX will continue to strain our limited financial and management resources.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a reporting public company. SOX and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. As such, our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, SOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 of SOX requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, the terms of the A&R Note Agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have a sporadic, illiquid, volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock may remain sporadic, illiquid, and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future and will likely be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf our ability or inability to generate revenues;\n\u25cf the number of shares in our public float;\n\u25cf increased competition; and\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the market for oil and gas and down-hole services.\nFurthermore, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in our Company, and should not rely on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value, but should instead determine the value of our common stock based on the information contained in our public reports, industry information, and those business valuation methods commonly used to value private companies.\nFir Tree may have significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require stockholder approval, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nFir Tree currently has the right to nominate and appoint up to a total of three individuals to the Board. As a result, Fir Tree has influence over our decisions to certain corporate actions including those specified in the A&R Stockholder Rights Agreement.\nMoreover, Fir Tree has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our Company. Specifically, under the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement, for so long as Fir Tree beneficially owns more than 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis), Fir Tree, subject to certain exclusions, has a preemptive right to purchase any new securities we propose to issue or sell in an amount not to exceed the amount of such new securities that Fir Tree would need to beneficially own so that its beneficial ownership of our common Stock does not decrease as a result of such issuance or sale. As a result, Fir Tree\u2019s preemptive right will apply to any securities we issue during an underwritten public offering. Therefore, while other holders of our stock would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection with a new issuance of securities by us, Fir Tree would, through this preemptive right, have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in percentage ownership. As long as Fir Tree continues to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to influence the vote in any election of directors and over decisions that require stockholder approval. Please read Part III - Item 13 - \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nConvertible debt not converting to equity can have an adverse effect on the Company\nOn March 6, 2017, the Company closed a transaction with Fir Tree and the ACM entities pursuant to which, among other things, Fir Tree purchased from the ACM entities $22 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding convertible notes due 2018. This transaction was part of a comprehensive recapitalization designed to create a path to a potential conversion to equity of substantially all the Company\u2019s debt, subject to shareholder approval and satisfaction of certain other conditions. As part of the transaction, the Company issued to Fir Tree an additional $19.4 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes. After giving effect to these transactions, the Company now has approximately $41.4 million of outstanding convertible notes due May 28, 2018 which accrue interest at 20% per annum. Fir Tree has agreed to convert all the outstanding convertible notes into common stock at a conversion price of $1.40 per share, subject to receipt of shareholder approval at the next shareholder meeting, and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Based on commitments from some of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders, we believe that the convertible notes will be exchanged for common stock at $1.40 per share at the next shareholder meeting, however, if the convertible notes remain outstanding following the next shareholder meeting, the Company will be required to make a semi-annual interest payment of approximately $3.7 million on August 15, 2017. At that time, we may not have sufficient cash to pay this interest payment, resulting in potential default of the loan.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 15290, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "ESESQ"}
