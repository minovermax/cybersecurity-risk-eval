RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated herein that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY\nWe have incurred net losses since inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have never generated revenue and may never be profitable.\nSince our inception in 2010, we have incurred net losses. Our net loss for the year ended February 28, 2017 was $8.8 million. We have only one customer, and have not earned any revenues to date. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock and have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, as well as to building out our team. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Although we believe that our business plan has significant profit potential, we may not attain profitable operations and our management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. Our ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our products, obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products and attract additional customers. We may not generate revenues from product sales for the next several years, if ever. If we are not able to develop our business as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur depolymerization business was started in October 2014 with the incorporation of Loop Holdings, Inc. and acquisition of intellectual property from Hatem Essaddam and 8198381 Canada Inc., a corporation organized under the federal laws of Canada and wholly-owned by Mr. Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and majority stockholder. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our technology. We have not yet demonstrated the ability to manufacture a commercial-scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company that is also capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe expect to suffer losses in the immediate future that may cause us to curtail or discontinue our operations.\nWe expect to incur operating losses in future periods. These losses will occur because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with the development of our PET depolymerization business and our business operations, generally. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will almost certainly fail.\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or stay in business without additional funding.\nOur ability to generate future operating revenues depends in part on whether we can obtain the financing necessary to implement our business plan. We will likely require additional financing through the issuance of debt and/or equity in order to establish profitable operations, and such financing may not be forthcoming. If there is no investor appetite to finance our specific business, we may not be able to acquire additional financing through credit markets or equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms favorable to us. Our failure to secure additional financing on favorable terms when it becomes required would have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.\nIf are unable to successfully scale our manufacturing processes, we may not meet customer demand.\nTo be successful, we will have to successfully scale our manufacturing processes while maintaining high product quality and reliability. If we cannot maintain high product quality on a large scale, our business will be adversely affected. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems with the supply of key components. Even if we are successful in developing our manufacturing capability, we do not know whether we will do so in time to satisfy the requirements of our customers. The current manufacturing facility is a pilot plant with limited production capacity. In order to fully implement our business plans, we will need to move the operations to a larger facility, develop strategic partnerships or find other means to produce greater volumes of finished product.\nDisruption at, damage to or destruction of our pilot plant or facilities could impede our ability to process the PET and make PTA and MEG, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently rely on our manufacturing facilities at a single location in Montreal. Any interruption in manufacturing operations at this location could result in our inability to satisfy the product demands of our customers. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions or failures, technology malfunctions, work stoppages or slow-downs, damage to or destruction of the facility or regional power shortages. As our equipment ages, it will need to be replaced. Replacement of equipment has the potential to introduce variations in the manufacturing process that may result in lot failures or manufacturing shut-down, delay in the release of lots, product recalls, spoilage or regulatory action. Any disruption that impedes our ability to process PET in a timely manner could reduce our revenues and materially harm our business.\nThe plastics manufacturing industry is extremely price competitive because of the commodity like nature of PET resin and its correlation to the price of crude oil. If our cost to manufacture recycled PET is not competitive with virgin PET or if the price of oil reduces significantly, it may adversely impact our ability to penetrate the market or be profitable.\nThe demand for recycled PET has fluctuated with the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices decline the cost to manufacture recycled PET may become comparatively higher than the cost to manufacture virgin PET. Our ability to penetrate the market will depend in part on the cost of manufacturing virgin PET and if we do not successfully distinguish our product from those of virgin PET manufacturers our entry into the market and our ability to secure customer contracts can be adversely affected.\nThe loss of the services of Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and majority stockholder, or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our business.\nThe development of our PET materials depolymerization business and the marketing of our prospective products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel, management, and other resources. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers who are developing our business, and on our ability to identify and retain competent consultants and employees with the skills required to execute our business objectives. The loss of the services of Daniel Solomita or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our business which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth.\nOur pilot plant was completed early this year and we have not yet fully implemented all policies, procedures, and controls for the operation of a chemical manufacturing facility as required under various federal, provincial and local regulations and codes.\nWe are subject to health and safety as well as environmental, zoning and any other regulatory requirements to operate our pilot plant. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, as well as discovery of previously unknown problems, may result in, among other things, costly regulatory inspections, fines or remediation plans. If regulatory issues arise, the value of our business and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, applicable regulations may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impact our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, are slow or unable to adopt new requirements or policies, or effect changes to existing requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive advantage.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection, nondisclosure and nonuse agreements to protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks and similar proprietary rights.\nIn addition, patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us, and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed. We may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which can demand significant financial and management resources. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. Moreover, our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.\nWe may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.\nWe may face costly intellectual property infringement claims, the result of which would decrease the amount of cash we would require to operate and complete our business plan.\nWe anticipate that from time to time we will receive communications from third parties asserting that we are infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others or seeking indemnification against alleged infringement. If anticipated claims arise, we will evaluate their merits. Any claims of infringement brought of third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation, damages for infringement, and the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to incur significant costs and require significant management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as amended, we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Section 404\"). Section 404 requires us to include an internal control report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must include management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities. Achieving continued compliance with Section 404 may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to fully comply with Section 404 or that we and our independent registered public accounting firm would be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year-end. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities, as well as subject us to civil or criminal investigations and penalties. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management's assessment or conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SECURITIES\nWe may, in the future, issue additional common shares, which would reduce investors' percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 250,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of May 11, 2017, we had 32,595,173 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and one share of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The future issuance of common stock and/or preferred stock will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Daniel Solomita, beneficially owns a majority of our capital stock, and accordingly, has control over stockholder matters, our business and management.\nAs of May 11, 2017, Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and majority stockholder, beneficially owns 18,600,000 shares of common stock, or 57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and also holds one share of Series A Preferred Stock. The one share of Series A Preferred Stock issued to Mr. Solomita holds a majority of the total voting power so long as Mr. Solomita holds not less than 7.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, assuring that Mr. Solomita retains control even if his presently-held 57% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock is diluted to a level below a majority.\nAdditionally, the one share of Series A Preferred Stock issued to Mr. Solomita contains protective provisions, which precludes us from taking certain actions without Mr. Solomita\u2019s (or that of any person to whom the one share of Series A Preferred Stock is transferred) approval. More specifically, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, we are not permitted to take certain actions without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, including for example and without limitation, amending our articles of incorporation, changing or modifying the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, including increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock, increasing or decreasing the size of the board of directors or remove the director appointed by the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and declaring or paying any dividend or other distribution.\nMoreover, because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders, new investors may not be able to effect a change in our business or management, and therefore, stockholders would have no recourse as a result of decisions made by management.\nIn addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Solomita, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management's stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our company.\nThough not now, we may be or in the future we may become subject to Nevada's control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada's control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a \"controlling interest\" which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the company in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.\nThe effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the company, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law.\nIf control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights, is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder's shares.\nIn addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \"interested stockholders\" for three years after the \"interested stockholder\" first becomes an \"interested stockholder,\" unless the company's board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an \"interested stockholder\" is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the company, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the company and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the company. The definition of the term \"combination\" is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the company's assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the company and its other stockholders.\nThe effect of Nevada's business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. Stockholders may not be able to sell shares when desired. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that there are various risks. You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 17116, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "LOOP"}
