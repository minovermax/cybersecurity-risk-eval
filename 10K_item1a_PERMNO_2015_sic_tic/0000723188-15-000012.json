Risk Factors\nThere are risks inherent in the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Adverse experience with these could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability, assets and liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s income and cash flow depends to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, which could reduce the amount of fee income generated, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (3) the average duration of the Company\u2019s various categories of earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income could be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect our earnings. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of its operations. The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation by the FRB and its banking subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC. These regulations affect deposit and lending practices, capital levels and structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. In addition, the non-bank subsidiaries are engaged in providing investment management and insurance brokerage services, which industries are also heavily regulated at both a state and federal level. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Company and its subsidiaries may engage. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Company and its operations. Changes to the regulatory laws governing these businesses could affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver or expand its services and adversely impact its operations and financial condition.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is sweeping legislation intended to overhaul regulation of the financial services industry. Its goals are to establish a new council of \u201csystemic risk\u201d regulators, create a new consumer protection division, empower the Federal Reserve to supervise the largest, most complex financial companies, allow the government to seize and liquidate failing financial companies, and give regulators new powers to oversee the derivatives market. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are so extensive that full implementation may require several years, and an assessment of its full effect on the Company is not possible at this time.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB and authorizes it to supervise certain consumer financial services companies and large depository institutions and their affiliates for consumer protection purposes. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the CFPB has responsibility to implement, examine for compliance with, and enforce \u201cFederal consumer financial law.\u201d As a depository institution, the Company is subject to the regulations promulgated by the CFPB, which will focus on the Company\u2019s ability to detect, prevent, and correct practices that present a significant risk of violating the law and causing consumer harm.\nThe CFPB\u2019s QM Rule became effective on January 10, 2014. The QM Rule is designed to clarify how lenders can manage the potential legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act which would hold lenders accountable for insuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. The QM Rule on qualified mortgages and similar rules could limit the Bank\u2019s ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and time-consuming to make these loans, which could limit the Bank\u2019s growth or profitability.\nCompliance with new laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs and/or decreases in revenue, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act restricting bank interchange fees, and any rules promulgated thereunder, may negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule, effective as of October 1, 2011, addressing interchange fees for debit card transactions that is expected to lower fee income generated from this source. This rule limits interchange fees on debit card transactions to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the Federal Reserve. Although technically the fee caps rule only applies to institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion, it is expected that smaller institutions, such as the Company, may also be impacted due to market reaction. The Company contracts with large debit card processors and clearing networks with which it could have weaker bargaining power due to the interchange fee limitations. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company continues to expect to earn lower revenues on these types of transactions.\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nAs discussed above, Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act require the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits for banks and bank holding companies. Under the legislation, the federal banking agencies are required to develop capital requirements that address systemically-risky activities. The capital rules must address, at a minimum, risks arising from significant volumes of activity in derivatives, securities products, financial guarantees, securities borrowing and lending and repurchase agreements; concentrations in assets for which reported values are based on models; and concentrations in market share for any activity that would substantially disrupt financial markets if the institutions were forced to unexpectedly cease the activity. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, or could require it to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nRegional economic factors may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s main markets are located in the states of New York and Pennsylvania. Most of the Company\u2019s customers are individuals and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit funding sources. A prolonged economic downturn in these markets could negatively impact the Company.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company\u2019s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.\nThe allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the creditworthiness of its customers. The Company reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. If the Company\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease its net income. It is possible that over time the allowance for loan losses will be inadequate to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets.\nChanges in the equity markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for other fee-based services.\nEconomic downturns could affect the volume of income from and demand for fee-based services. Revenue from the wealth management and benefit plan administration businesses depends in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility that can lead customers to liquidate investment, as well as lower asset values, can reduce our level of assets under management and administration and thereby decrease the Company\u2019s investment management and administration revenues.\nMortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, and real estate and refinancing activity. In lower interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income, but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In higher interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be lower. This has the effect of decreasing fee income opportunities.\nThe Company depends on dividends from its banking subsidiary for cash revenues, but those dividends are subject to restrictions.\nThe ability of the Company to satisfy its obligations and pay cash dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on the earnings of and dividends from the subsidiary bank. However, payment of dividends by the bank subsidiary is limited by dividend restrictions and capital requirements imposed by bank regulations. The ability to pay dividends is also subject to the continued payment of interest that the Company owes on its subordinated junior debentures. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $102 million of subordinated junior debentures outstanding. The Company has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated junior debentures for a period not exceeding 20 quarters, although the Company has not done so to date. If the Company defers interest payments on the subordinated junior debentures, it will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from paying cash dividends on the common stock until all deferred interest has been paid and interest payments on the subordinated junior debentures resumes.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and result of operations.\nThe business strategy of the Company includes growth through acquisition. Any other future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include among other things: the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the inability of the Company\u2019s management to maximize its financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a company may deteriorate after the acquisition agreement is signed or after the acquisition closes.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges in respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, the economic condition of state and local municipalities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment or a decision to change the operations or dispose of an operating unit could have a negative effect on the investment portfolio, goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and certain loans, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Company\u2019s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Company may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, it may experience material losses.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. The Company may be the subject of sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to assets or confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s online banking system, its general ledger, and its deposit and loan servicing and origination systems. Furthermore, if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Company\u2019s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company\u2019s systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems; however, any such failure, interruption or security breach could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations through loss of assets or by requiring it to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing the Company to customer dissatisfaction and civil litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nThe Company owns common stock of FHLB in order to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. The carrying value of the Company\u2019s FHLB common stock was $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014. There are 12 branches of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, including New York. Statutorily, to the extent that one Federal Home Loan Bank branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system\u2019s debt, other Federal Home Loan Bank branches can be called upon to make any required payments. Any such adverse effects on the FHLBNY could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investment in its common stock and negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is or may become involved in lawsuits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, many aspects of the Company\u2019s business involve substantial risk of legal liability. The Company and its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries\u2019 business activities (and in some cases from the activities of acquired companies). In addition, from time to time, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company\u2019s ultimate losses may be higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change and may have to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations.\nTrading activity in the Company\u2019s common stock could result in material price fluctuations.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nChanges in securities analysts\u2019 expectations of financial performance;\n\u25cf\nVolatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf\nIncorrect information or speculation;\n\u25cf\nChanges in industry valuations;\n\u25cf\nVariations in operating results from general expectations;\n\u25cf\nActions taken against the Company by various regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\nChanges in authoritative accounting guidance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\nChanges in general domestic economic conditions such as inflation rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, oil prices, labor and healthcare cost trend rates, recessions, and changing government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may have a materially adverse affect on the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Company or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Company is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Company\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could have a materially adverse affect.", "PERMNO": 86896, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBU"}
