{"cik": "928022", "company": "Callon Petroleum Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Oil & Natural Gas Industry\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and substantial or extended declines in prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our success is highly dependent on prices for oil and natural gas, which have in recent years been, and we expect will continue to be, extremely volatile. During the five years ended December 31, 2019, NYMEX WTI prices ranged from a high of $77.41 per barrel on June 27, 2018 to a low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016, and NYMEX Henry Hub prices ranged from a high of $6.24 per MMBtu on January 2, 2018 to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on March 4, 2016. The prices of oil and natural gas depend on factors we cannot control, such as macro-economic conditions, levels of production, domestic and worldwide inventories, demand for oil and natural gas, the capacity of U.S. and international refiners to use U.S. supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs, relative price and availability of alternative forms of energy, actions by non-governmental organizations, OPEC and other countries, legislative and regulatory actions, technology developments impacting energy consumption and energy supply, and weather. These factors make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs price movements with any certainty. We make price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of our cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancelable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.\nIn general, prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs affect the following aspects of our business:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows, earnings and returns;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract capital to finance our operations and the cost of the capital;\n\u2022\nthe amount we are allowed to borrow under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nthe profit or loss we incur in exploring for and developing our reserves; and\n\u2022\nthe value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nA substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and cause a significant portion of our development projects to become uneconomic. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. A reduction in production could also result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require us to reduce capital spending, which could negatively affect our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth, or require us to borrow funds to cover any such shortfall, which we may be unable to obtain at such time on satisfactory terms. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain depressed for extended periods of time, we may be required to make significant downward adjustments to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method, which we use to account for our oil and natural gas properties, the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the PV-10 of our estimated proved reserves, using the 12-Month Average Realized Price, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of our unproved properties. If such net capitalized costs exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This type of charge will not affect our cash flows, but will reduce the book value of our stockholders\u2019 equity. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly and once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date, even if prices increase. See \u201cNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Operations for additional information.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations. We compete with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of our business. Our competitors in development, exploration, acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and gas companies and smaller independents as well as numerous financial buyers. Some of our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. We also compete for the materials, equipment, personnel and services that are necessary for the exploration, development and operation of our properties. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. From time to time, our industry experiences a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, during periods in which the levels of exploration and production increase, the demand for, and wages and costs of, drilling rig crews and other experienced personnel, oilfield services and equipment typically also increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer.\nAll of our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in only two geographic regions. As a result of this concentration, as compared to\ncompanies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, or market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs. Such delays, interruptions or limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may be more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of recent acquisitions with our operations, and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. We have completed, and may in the future complete, acquisitions that include undeveloped acreage. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve the desired profitability from our acquisitions, including the Carrizo Acquisition, or from any acquisitions we may complete in the future. In addition, failure to integrate recent and future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions, including the recently completed Carrizo Acquisition, may involve numerous risks, including those relating to:\n\u2022\noperating a larger, more complex combined organization and adding operations;\n\u2022\nassimilating the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new geographic area;\n\u2022\nacquired oil and natural gas reserves not being of the anticipated magnitude or as developed as anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe loss of significant key employees, including from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity if we use a portion of our available cash to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could result in, among other things, performance shortfalls;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions;\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nintegrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. With respect to the Carrizo Acquisition in particular, we have incurred a number of costs associated with completing the Carrizo acquisition and expect to continue to incur significant costs to integrate the business of Carrizo. The elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of our two companies, may not initially offset integration-related costs or achieve a net benefit in the near term or at all.\nIf we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on current operations, which in turn, could negatively impact our future results of operations.\nWe may fail to fully identify problems with any properties we acquire, and as such, assets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities. We are actively seeking to acquire additional acreage in Texas or other regions in the future. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, adequacy of title, operating and capital costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. Although we conduct a review that we believe is consistent with industry practices, we can give no assurance that we have identified or will identify all existing or potential problems associated with such properties or that we will be able to mitigate any problems we do identify. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface, title and environmental problems that may exist or arise. We are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms.\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain, recycle and dispose of water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner. Water is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to secure water from local land owners and other third party sources for use in our operations. If drought conditions were to occur or demand for water were to outpace supply, our ability to obtain water could be impacted and in turn, our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing operations could be restricted or made more costly. Along with the risks of other extreme\nweather events, drought risk, in particular, is likely increased by climate change. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant amounts of water are produced in our operations. Inadequate access to or availability of water recycling or water disposal facilities could adversely affect our production volumes or significantly increase the cost of our operations.\nFactors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of gas processing facilities and pipelines and other transportation operations owned and operated by third parties, affect the marketability of our production. The ability to market oil and natural gas from our wells depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. A significant factor in our ability to market our production is the availability and capacity of gas processing facilities and pipeline and other transportation operations, including trucking services, owned and operated by third parties. These facilities and services may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, physical or mechanical disruption, weather, lack of contracted capacity, pipeline safety issues, or other reasons. In addition, in certain newer development areas, processing and transportation facilities and services may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production and it may be necessary for new interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Our failure to obtain access to processing and transportation facilities and services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells for lack of a market or because of inadequate or unavailable processing or transportation capacity. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until transportation arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. Furthermore, if we were required to shut in wells, we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners in order to maintain our leases. If we were required to shut in our production for long periods of time due to lack of transportation capacity, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOther factors that affect our ability to market our production include:\n\u2022\nthe extent of domestic production and imports/exports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nfederal regulations authorizing exports of liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d), the development of new LNG export facilities under construction in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, and the first LNG exports from such facilities;\n\u2022\nthe construction of new pipelines capable of exporting U.S. natural gas to Mexico and transporting Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin oil production to the Gulf Coast;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of hydrocarbon production to pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nthe effects of inclement weather; and\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulation of oil, natural gas and NGL marketing and transportation.\nWe have entered into firm transportation contracts that require us to pay fixed sums of money regardless of quantities actually shipped. If we are unable to deliver the minimum quantities of production, such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. We have entered into firm transportation agreements for a portion of our production in certain areas in order to improve our ability, and that of our purchasers, to successfully market our production. We may also enter into firm transportation arrangements for additional production in the future. These firm transportation agreements may be more costly than interruptible or short-term transportation agreements. Additionally, these agreements obligate us to pay fees on minimum volumes regardless of actual throughput. If we have insufficient production to meet the minimum volumes, the requirements to pay for quantities not delivered could have an impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nOur estimated reserves are based on interpretations and assumptions that may be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. This Annual Report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir and is therefore inherently imprecise. These assumptions include those required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from the estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, estimates of reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions, based on production history, development drilling and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas.\nYou should not assume that any PV-10 of our estimated proved reserves contained in this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K represents the market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. We base the PV-10 from our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2019 on the 12-Month Average Realized Price and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Further, actual future net revenues will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual development expenditures, the rate and timing of production, and changes in governmental regulations or taxes. Recovery of PUDs generally requires significant\ncapital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve estimates include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these PUDs and the actual costs, development schedule, and results associated with these properties may not be as estimated. In addition, the discount factor used to calculate PV-10 may not be appropriate based on our cost of capital from time to time and the risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry.\nUnless we replace our oil and gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline. Our future oil and gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our production, revenues, reserve quantities and cash flows will decline. In general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. We may not be successful in finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves, and our efforts may not be economic. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could prevent them from being drilled or delay their drilling. Our management team has identified drilling locations as an estimation of our future development activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these identified drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, availability and cost of drilling, completion and production services and equipment, lease expirations, regulatory approvals, and other factors discussed in these risk factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the identified locations are located, the leases for such acreage will expire. Therefore, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nOur exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks. We may invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that any leasehold acreage acquired will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, including wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return and wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Wells may have production decline rates that are greater than anticipated. Future drilling and completion efforts may impact production from existing wells, and parent-child effects may impact future well productivity as a result of timing, spacing proximity or other factors. Failure to conduct our oil and gas operations in a profitable manner may result in write-downs of our proved reserves quantities, impairment of our oil and gas properties, and a write-down in the carrying value of our unproved properties, and over time may adversely affect our growth, revenues and cash flows.\nThe development of our PUDs may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Developing PUDs requires significant capital expenditures, successful drilling operations, and a substantial amount of our proved reserves are PUDs which may not be ultimately developed or produced. Approximately 57% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, were PUDs. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume significant capital expenditures will be made to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated capital expenditures to develop these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled, or that the results of such development will be as estimated. We may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; lack of proximity to and shortage of capacity of transportation facilities; equipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment, personnel and services; and compliance with governmental requirements. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated PUDs and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nThe results of our planned development programs in new or emerging shale development areas and formations may be subject to more uncertainties than programs in more established areas and formations, and may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. The results of our horizontal drilling efforts in emerging areas and formations of the Permian Basin are generally more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have more established production from horizontal formations. Because emerging areas and associated target formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to rely on past drilling results in those areas as a basis to predict our future drilling results. In addition, horizontal wells drilled in shale formations, as distinguished from vertical wells, utilize multilateral wells and stacked laterals, all of which are subject to well spacing, density and proration requirements of the Texas Railroad Commission (the \u201cRRC\u201d), which requirements could adversely impact our ability to maximize the efficiency of our horizontal wells related to reservoir drainage over time. Further, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline takeaway capacity and the availability of drilling rigs and other services may be more challenging in new or emerging areas. If our drilling results in these areas are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program in these areas because of capital constraints, access to\ngathering systems and takeaway capacity or otherwise, or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate, we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur operations are subject to operating hazards that may adversely impact our ability to conduct business, and we may not be fully insured against all such operating risks. The operating hazards in exploring for and producing oil and natural gas include: encountering unexpected subsurface conditions that cause damage to equipment or personal injury, including loss of life; equipment failures that curtail or stop production or cause severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or other equipment; blowouts or other damages to the productive formations of our reserves that require a well to be re-drilled or other corrective action to be taken; and storms and other extreme weather conditions that cause damages to our production facilities or wells. Because of these or other events, we could experience environmental hazards, including release of oil and natural gas from spills, natural gas leaks, accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or fracturing fluids, including chemical additives, underground migration, and ruptures. If we experience any of these problems, we could incur substantial losses in excess of our insurance coverage.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or claim, not fully insured or indemnified against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Also, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable to cover our possible losses from operating hazards and we may elect no or minimal insurance coverage.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results. We utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production. In addition, problems affecting a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad, which would further cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production. These delays or interruptions may cause volatility in our operating results. Further, any delay, reduction or curtailment of our development and producing operations due to operational delays caused by multi-well pad drilling could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate. We depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our senior officers and other key employees, as well as other third-party consultants with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing drilling prospects and producing oil and natural gas and maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties. Our ability to retain our senior officers, other key employees, and third party consultants, many of whom are not subject to employment agreements, is important to our future success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry. The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats. A cyberattack or similar incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation or financial loss. The oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, manage operations, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period and could lead to disruptions in critical systems or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, disruption of operations, damage to our reputation or potential liability. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Cyber incidents have increased, and the U.S. government has issued warnings indicating that energy assets may be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyberattacks.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Opposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development.\nRisks Related to Financial Position\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial institutions, the sale of public debt and equity securities and asset dispositions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, participation of non-operating working interest owners, the cost and availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nIf the borrowing base under our Credit Facility or our revenues decrease, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. The failure to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, could result in a curtailment of our development activities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. As of December 31, 2019, we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.2 billion. As a result of the Carrizo Acquisition, our level of indebtedness has significantly increased. Our amount of indebtedness could affect our operations in many ways, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmaking it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under our Credit Facility may vary with prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our senior notes or other debt and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities. Our Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make investments; merge or consolidate with another entity; pay dividends or make certain other payments; hedge future production or interest rates; create liens that secure indebtedness; sell assets; or engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to make certain required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest. If we fail to comply with these provisions or other financial and operating covenants in the Credit Facility or the indentures governing our senior notes, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur borrowings under our Credit Facility expose us to interest rate risk. Our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our Credit Facility, which bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 0.25% to 2.25% depending on the interest rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base.\nThe borrowing base under our Credit Facility may be reduced below the amount of borrowings outstanding thereunder. The borrowing base under our Credit Facility is currently $2.5 billion, with an elected commitment amount of $2.0 billion, and as of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate principal balance of $1.3 billion outstanding thereunder. Our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations semi-annually, and a future decrease in borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations may cause us to not be able to access adequate funding under the Credit Facility. If our borrowing base were to be reduced, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness. In addition, we cannot borrow amounts above the elected commitments, even if the borrowing base is greater, without new commitments being obtained from the lenders for such incremental amounts above the elected commitments. In the event the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility exceeds the elected commitments, we must repay such amounts immediately in cash. In the event the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we are required to either (i) grant liens on additional oil and gas properties (not previously evaluated in determining such borrowing base) with a value equal to or greater than such excess, (ii) repay such excess borrowings over six monthly installments, or (iii) elect a combination of options in clauses (i) and (ii). We may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, an event of default would occur under our Credit Facility.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to certain financial, economic, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Also, we may not be able to consummate dispositions at such time on terms acceptable to us or at all, and the proceeds of any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet such debt service obligations. Furthermore, any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. For example, our Credit Facility currently restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition.\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or improve our leverage position. An element of our business strategy involves maintaining a disciplined approach to financial management. However, we are also seeking to acquire, exploit and develop additional reserves that may require the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Although we will seek to maintain or improve our leverage position, our ability to maintain or reduce our level of indebtedness depends on a variety of factors, including future performance and our future debt financing needs. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will also affect our ability to maintain or improve our leverage position. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nOur hedging program may limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices, result in losses, or be inadequate to protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in commodity prices. We enter into arrangements to hedge a portion of our production from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. Our hedges at December 31, 2019 are in the form of collars, swaps, put and call options, basis swaps, and other structures placed with the commodity trading branches of certain national banking institutions and with certain other commodity trading groups. These hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the market or spot prices for oil and natural gas. We cannot be certain that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in oil and natural gas prices. To the extent that oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or decline further, we would not be able to hedge future production at the same pricing level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, in a typical hedge transaction, we will have the right to receive from the other parties to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we are required to pay the other parties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of physical production.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk. Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract, particularly during periods of falling commodity prices. Disruptions in the financial markets or other factors outside our control could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform, and even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending on market conditions at the time. If the creditworthiness of any of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results. Our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, advances to joint interest parties and joint interest receivables. We are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our oil and natural gas accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to use our existing net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could be limited. A portion of our NOL carryforward balance was generated prior to the effective date of new limitations on utilization of NOLs imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) and are allowable as a deduction against 100 percent of taxable income in future years but will start to expire in the tax year 2035. The remainder was generated following such effective date and thus are allowable as a deduction against 80 percent of taxable income in future years and do not expire. Utilization of any NOL carryforwards depends on many factors, including our ability to generate future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes, upon the occurrence of an ownership change (discussed below), an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-ownership change NOLs we can utilize to offset our taxable income in any taxable year (or portion thereof) ending after such ownership change. The limitation is generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax exempt rate. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) at any time during a rolling three-year period. The Company has reduced the total recorded NOL balance and associated deferred tax asset for the NOLs to the amount expected to be fully utilizable before they expire. Future ownership changes or future regulatory changes could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows once we attain profitability.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U. S., and our domestic tax assets and liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in our taxing jurisdictions.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms. Our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook. Our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain. Because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth, adverse changes in our credit rating may have a negative effect on our future growth.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital. Certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting our future financial results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations which require compliance that could result in substantial costs, delays or penalties. Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. For a discussion of the material regulations applicable to us, see \u201cBusiness and Properties-Regulations.\u201d These laws and regulations may:\n\u2022\nrequire that we acquire permits before commencing drilling;\n\u2022\nregulate the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022\nimpose limitations on production or operational, emissions control and other conditions on our activities;\n\u2022\nrestrict the substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling and production activities or restrict the disposal of waste from our operations;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas, such as wetlands and wilderness;\n\u2022\nimpose penalties or other sanctions for accidental or unpermitted spills or releases from our operations; or\n\u2022\nrequire measures to remediate or mitigate pollution and environmental impacts from current and former operations, such as cleaning up spills or dismantling abandoned production facilities.\nSignificant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls or injunctions limiting or prohibiting operations.\nThe regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal, state and local agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and such changes could result in increased costs for environmental compliance, such as emissions control, permitting, or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation or disposal for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs. In general, the oil and natural gas industry recently has been the subject of increased legislative and regulatory attention with respect to public health and environmental matters. Even if regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the long-term.\nFurther, under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for costs of investigation, removal and remediation, damages to and loss of use of natural resources, loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity, property damages, costs of increased public services, as well as administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, and injunctive relief. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA, OPA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to investigate, clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or other waste products have been disposed of or otherwise released (i.e., liability may be imposed regardless of whether the current owner or operator was responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the release or contamination occurred). We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, engine and other equipment emissions, GHGs and hydraulic fracturing. Under common law, we could be liable for injuries to people and property. We maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages. We do not believe that insurance coverage for environmental damages that occur over time is available at a reasonable cost. Also, we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability in excess of our insurance coverage or we may be required to curtail or cease production from properties in the event of environmental incidents.\nFederal legislation and state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, from time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing but has not passed. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in February 2014, the EPA published permitting guidance addressing the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations, and issued an interpretive memorandum clarifying that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as \u201cClass II\u201d Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA has also published air emission standards for certain equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector, although the EPA proposed amendments in August 2019 that would rescind requirements related to the regulation of methane emissions. Additionally, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. Although the BLM subsequently rescinded the rule in December 2017, the rescission has been challenged in federal court by several environmental groups and states. In November 2016, the BLM also issued rules to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands, but subsequently relaxed and rescinded certain requirements of the rules in September 2018; a lawsuit challenging the September 2018 rule revision is pending.\nIn some areas of Texas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin, there has been concern that certain formations into which disposal wells are injecting produced waters could become over-pressured after many years of injection, and the RRC is reviewing the data to determine whether any regulatory action is necessary to address this issue. If the RRC were to decline to issue permits for, or limit the volumes of, new injection wells into the formations that we currently utilize, we may be required to seek alternative methods of disposing of produced waters, including injecting into deeper formations, which could increase our costs.\nSome states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, Texas law requires the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used, must be disclosed to the RRC and the public. Furthermore, the RRC issued the \u201cwell integrity rule\u201d in May 2013, which includes testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit to the RRC cementing reports after well completion or cessation of drilling, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. Additionally, in October 2014, the RRC adopted a rule requiring applicants for certain new water disposal wells to conduct seismic activity searches using the U.S. Geological Survey to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles. The rule also clarifies the RRC\u2019s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report \u201cHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States.\u201d This report concludes that hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources in certain circumstances but also noted that certain data gaps and uncertainties limited EPA\u2019s ability to fully characterize the severity of impacts or calculate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from activities in the hydraulic fracturing water cycle. This study could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could restrict our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, water usage and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally, and a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or water disposal wells are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill for and produce oil and natural gas as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHG, changes in the availability of financing for fossil fuel companies, and physical effects from climate change could adversely impact our operating costs and demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Several states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives. For a description of existing and proposed GHG rules and regulations, see \u201cRegulations.\u201d\nIn December 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change resulted in 195 countries, including the United States, coming together to develop the Paris Agreement, which calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016, and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. The United States formally announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2019, which withdrawal will become effective on November 4, 2020. Certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. A number of states have begun taking actions to control or reduce emissions of GHGs. Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Moreover, incentives or requirements to conserve energy, use alternative energy sources, reduce GHG emissions in product supply chains, and increase demand for low-carbon\nfuel or zero-emissions vehicles, could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could impact our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, some parties have initiated public nuisance claims under federal or state common law against certain companies involved in the production of oil and natural gas. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. Although our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFinally, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of droughts, storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced or cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to the effects of climatic events themselves. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from winds or floods or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects.\nCurrent or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the over-the-counter market.\nAlthough the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas, including the scope of relevant definitions or exemptions, remain pending. In one of the CFTC\u2019s rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has proposed but not yet finalized position limits for certain futures and options contracts in various commodities and for swaps that are their economic equivalents (with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions). Similarly, the CFTC has proposed but not yet finalized a rule regarding the capital that a swap dealer or major swap participant is required to post with respect to its swap business. The CFTC issued a final rule on margin requirements for uncleared swap transactions in January 2016, which it amended in November 2018. The final rule as amended includes an exemption for certain commercial end-users that enter into uncleared swaps in order to hedge bona fide commercial risks affecting their business. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception from the requirement to use cleared exchanges (rather than hedging over-the-counter) for commercial end-users who use swaps to hedge their commercial risks. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict the timing or contents of the CFTC\u2019s final rules on position limits or capital requirements. Depending on our ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for the various exemptions available for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate its commercial risks, the final rules may provide beneficial exemptions or may require us to comply with position limits and other limitations with respect to our financial derivative activities. When a final rule on capital requirements is issued, the Dodd-Frank Act may require our current counterparties to post additional capital as a result of entering into uncleared financial derivatives with us, which could increase the cost to us of entering into such derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to cease their current business as hedge providers or spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. These potential changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets which would reduce the ability of commercial end-users like us to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nIn addition, federal banking regulators have adopted new capital requirements for certain regulated financial institutions in connection with the Basel III Accord. The Federal Reserve Board also issued proposed regulations on September 30, 2016, proposing to impose higher risk-weighted capital requirements on financial institutions active in physical commodities, such as oil and natural gas. If and when these proposed regulations are fully implemented, financial institutions subject to these higher capital requirements may require that we provide cash or other collateral with respect to our obligations under the financial derivatives and other contracts in order to reduce the amount of capital such financial institutions may have to maintain. Alternatively, financial institutions subject to these capital requirements may require premiums to enter into derivatives and other physical commodity transactions to compensate for the additional capital costs for these transactions. Rules implementing the Basel III Accord and higher risk-weighted capital requirements could materially\nreduce our liquidity and increase the cost of derivative contracts and other physical commodity contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes).\nIf we reduce our use of derivative contracts as a result of any of the foregoing new requirements, our results of operations may become more volatile and cash flows less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTax laws and regulations may change over time, and the recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Act that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Tax Act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate, (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, (iii) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (iv) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (v) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and gas companies. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment has on us. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in interpretations or assumptions could adversely affect our business and financial condition. See \u201cNote 12 - Income Taxes\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn addition, from time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including (i) the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. While these specific changes were not included in the Tax Act, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of such U.S. federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to the actions of activist shareholders. We have been the subject of an activist shareholder in the past. Responding to shareholder activism can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. Activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers and joint venture partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. Moreover, if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives, retain and attract experienced executives and employees and execute on our long-term strategy may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, or other employee of our company to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, or other employee of our company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or our charter or bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, or other employee of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery shall be the Court of Chancery or, if and only if the Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.\nOur exclusive forum provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. To the extent the provision could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the forum selection provision with respect to such claims, and in any event, our shareholders would not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing forum selection provision. This provision may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, prospects, or results of operations.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which we are not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in our Board of Directors and management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transactions and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Our Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior notes limit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. We have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock and any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors at the time of such determination. Consequently, unless we revise our dividend plans, a shareholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in us will be by selling its shares of our common stock at a price greater than the shareholder paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will exceed the price at which a shareholder purchased its shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of our common stock or other securities may dilute a shareholder\u2019s ownership in us. In the future, we may issue securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using any combination of cash and our common stock or other securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. In addition, secondary sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Any such reduction in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.", "PERMNO": 80926, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CPE"}
