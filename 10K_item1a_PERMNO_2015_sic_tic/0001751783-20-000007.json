{"cik": "1751783", "company": "Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA deterioration in economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction and consumer lending, including the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products and services may decrease;\n\u00b7\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u00b7\nthe value of our securities portfolio may decrease; and\n\u00b7\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decrease, thereby impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by a pandemic, inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect our financial performance. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe continue to closely monitor developments related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak to assess any potential impact on our business. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of this event, it currently is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential effects the outbreak may have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe coronavirus pandemic could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Since first being reported in China, the novel coronavirus has spread to additional countries, including the United States. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict its impact. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, among others.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance. If we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis or if the outbreak and its effects lead to recessionary conditions or a deterioration in economic conditions, we could be subject to any of the following consequences, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u00b7\nloan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;\n\u00b7\na work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business may occur;\n\u00b7\nour allowance for loan losses may have to be increased, especially if we believe an increase in our qualitative factors is warranted;\n\u00b7\nfuture borrowing power of our clients may be reduced;\n\u00b7\nour wealth management revenues may decline with continuing market turmoil;\n\u00b7\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs;\n\u00b7\nthe value of our securities portfolio may decline; and\n\u00b7\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above, or other factors, could materially adversely affect impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur automobile lending exposes us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2019, $360.6 million, or 45.7% of our total loan portfolio and 37.0% of our total assets, consisted of indirect automobile loans, which represents loans originated through automobile dealers for the purchase of new or used automobiles. At that date, $8.0 million, or 1.0% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of automobile loans that we originated directly. We serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. Automobile loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that may be difficult to locate and can depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers. We intend to continue to originate indirect automobile loans and to increase this type of lending. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Loan Underwriting Risks.\u201d\nOur emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business lending involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to continue to originate commercial real estate and commercial business loans. At December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate (which includes multi-family real estate loans and commercial construction loans) and commercial business loans totaled $359.2 million, or 45.5% of our loan portfolio. While these types of loans are potentially more profitable than residential mortgage loans due primarily to bearing generally higher interest rates, they are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making future losses more difficult to predict, and possibly more likely. These loans also generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, any charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loans. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Loan Underwriting Risks.\u201d\nOur business strategy involves moderate growth, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur assets increased $91.5 million, or 10.4%, from $882.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $973.9 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in loans receivable. Over the next several years, we expect to experience moderate growth in our total assets and deposits, and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the availability of attractive business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBuilding market share through de novo branching may cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nWe plan to continue to build market share by opening three new or de novo branches in Orange County, New York in the next two years. There are considerable costs involved in de novo branching as new branches generally require time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their initial start-up costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until the branch attracts a sufficient level of depositors and borrowers to offset expenses. We cannot assure you that our new branches will be successful even after they have been established.\nOur allowance for lease and loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for lease and loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in our portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for lease and loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions and other qualitative factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for lease and loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and adjustments may be necessary to address different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Consequently, a problem with one or more loans could require us to significantly increase our provision for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for lease and loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. and Rhinebeck Bank for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or \u201cCECL\u201d, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of establishing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for lease and loan losses, and increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of our allowance for lease and loan losses.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our profits.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIf interest rates rise, and the interest rates on our deposits increase faster than the interest rates we receive on our loans and investments, our interest rate spread would decrease, which would have a negative effect on our net interest income and profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make\nloan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to reinvest such loan or securities prepayments into lower-yielding assets, which may also negatively impact our income.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. While we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions cannot fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our assets. Our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses may reduce our profits.\nOur non-interest expenses totaled $27.9 million and $26.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although we continue to monitor our expenses and have achieved certain efficiencies, we have experienced increased costs. Moreover, our efficiency ratio, comparative to peers, remains high as a result of our higher operating expenses, even though we have increased our net interest income. Our efficiency ratio totaled 73.73% and 77.35% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Failure to control or maintain our expenses may reduce future profits.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio may reduce our profits and our capital levels.\nOur securities portfolio may be affected by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand.\nManagement evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, we may take a charge to earnings to reflect such impairment. Changes in interest rates may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are affected by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value may result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which may lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Rhinebeck Bank rather than for the protection of our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets and determine the level of our allowance for lease and loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which\nfinancial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nStrong competition within our market area may reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes requires us to charge lower interest rates on our loans and pay higher interest rates on our deposits, and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors often aggressively price loan and deposit products when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. If we are unable to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability would be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For more information about our market area and the competition we face, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Market Area\u201d and \u201c- Competition.\u201d\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also require unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. We elected to exercise our one-time option to opt-out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating our regulatory capital requirements. The regulations established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, which resulted in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. See \u201cItem 1. Supervision and Regulation - Federal Bank Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers that open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. Several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur success depends on retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals who comprise our senior management team. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation and our wealth management business. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our income. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which would reduce our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nSystems failures or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures designed to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that we could incur significant costs associated with a breach of our computer systems. While we have cyber liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage. Furthermore, cyber incidents carry a greater risk of injury to our reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on our business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer losses.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing the periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of specified dates. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience at such times and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for lease and loan losses, the determination of our deferred income taxes, our fair value measurements, our determination of goodwill impairment, and our evaluation of our defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use broad and diversified risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses if we fail to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. We have certain trust preferred securities and limited commercial real estate loans that are indexed to LIBOR. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or \u201cSOFR\u201d). When LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under trust preferred securities and our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nFederal Reserve Board regulations and policy effectively prohibit Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC from waiving the receipt of dividends, which will likely preclude us from paying any dividends on our common stock.\nRhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s board of directors has the authority to declare dividends on our common stock subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. We currently intend to retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made by our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions under Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy, our business strategy and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. See \u201cItem1. Business - Waivers of Dividends by Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC\u201d\nOur common stock is not heavily traded, and the stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ. Certain brokers currently make a market in the common stock, but such transactions are infrequent and the volume of shares traded is relatively small. Management cannot predict whether these or other brokers will continue to make a market in our common stock. Prices on stock that is not heavily traded, such as our common stock, can be more volatile than heavily traded stock. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, publicity regarding the banking industry, and various other factors affecting the banking industry may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares the common stock. Management also cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nPersons who have purchased stock will own a minority of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock and will not be able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders.\nPublic stockholders own a minority of the outstanding shares of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock. As a result, stockholders other than Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC are not able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC owns a majority of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock and, through its board of directors, are able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. Generally, the same directors and officers who manage Rhinebeck Bank also manage Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. and Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC. Our board of directors and officers or Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC may take action that the public stockholders believe to be contrary to their interests. The only matters that stockholders other than Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC are able to exercise voting control currently include any proposal to implement stock-based benefit plans or a \u201csecond-step\u201d conversion. In addition, Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC may exercise its voting control to prevent a sale or merger transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium for their shares.\nOur stock value may be negatively affected by applicable regulations that restrict stock repurchases.\nApplicable regulations restrict us from repurchasing our shares of common stock during the second and third years following the offering to 5% of our outstanding shares, unless we obtain prior approval from the NYSDFS. Stock repurchases are a capital management tool that can enhance the value of a company\u2019s stock, and our inability to repurchase any of our shares of common stock during the second and third years following the offering may negatively affect our stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Maryland law may discourage a corporate takeover.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and Bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Company\u2019s board of directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. First, the board of directors is classified into three classes. Directors of each class serve for staggered three-year periods, and no director may be removed except for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting stock. Second, the board has the authority to classify and reclassify unissued shares of stock of any class or series of stock by setting, fixing, eliminating, or altering in any one or more respects the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications of, dividends on, and redemption, conversion, exchange, and other rights of, such securities. The board could use this authority, along with its authority to authorize the issuance of securities of any class or series, to issue shares having terms favorable to management to a person or persons affiliated with or otherwise friendly to management. In addition, the Bylaws require any stockholder who desires to nominate a director to abide by strict notice requirements.\nMaryland law also contains anti-takeover provisions that apply to the Company. The Maryland Business Combination Act generally prohibits, subject to certain limited exceptions, corporations from being involved in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (defined as a variety of transactions, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of five years following the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is defined generally as a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation after the date on which that corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of\nits stock or who is an affiliate or associate of that corporation and was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of that corporation at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question and after the date on which that corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock. The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act applies to acquisitions of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d, which, subject to certain exceptions, are shares the acquisition of which entitle the holder, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of a corporation in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more, but less than one-third of all voting power; one-third or more, but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares have limited voting rights.\nAlthough these provisions do not preclude a takeover, they may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or deferring a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common stock. Such provisions will also render the removal of the Company\u2019s board of directors and of management more difficult and, therefore, may serve to perpetuate current management. These provisions could potentially adversely affect the market prices of the Company\u2019s securities.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and if we elect to comply only with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions.\nAs an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the offering.
