RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these principal risks include the following:\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks and General Economic Conditions\n\u2022The global COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\nRisks Relating to Competition\n\u2022The gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could adversely affect our financial results.\nCompliance, Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\u2022We or certain third parties that we rely on may fail to establish and maintain effective and compliant anti-money laundering, counter terrorism financing, safer gambling, fraud detection, risk management and other regulatory policies, procedures and controls.\n\u2022Our business is subject to a variety of US and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business across jurisdictions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions and legalization may not occur in as many jurisdictions as we expect, or may occur at a slower pace than we anticipate which could adversely affect our future results of operations.\n\u2022We derive meaningful revenues from players located in jurisdictions in which we do not hold a license.\nBusiness Operational Risks\n\u2022Our profitability will be dependent, in part, on return to players.\n\u2022We extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\n\u2022Declining popularity of games and changes in device preferences of players could have a negative effect on our business.\n\u2022Our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.\n\u2022Our branded sites are heavily reliant on well-known brands owned by third parties.\n\u2022Future changes to US and non-US tax laws could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we fail to detect fraud, theft or cheating, including by our users and employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\n\u2022Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\n\u2022We are reliant on the reliability and viability of Internet infrastructure, which is out of our control, and the proper functioning of our own network systems.\n\u2022Our business may be harmed from cybersecurity incidents.\nFinancing Risks\n\u2022Our debt agreements and the Regulatory Agreement contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\n\u2022Servicing our indebtedness and funding our other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which will be beyond our control.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n\u2022Our largest shareholder owns a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock, which could limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\n\u2022We are not paying dividends and any decision to do so in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\n\u2022We are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks and General Economic Conditions\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\nThe global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, requirements that individuals wear masks or other face coverings, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. The pandemic and its consequences dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms and other casino resort amenities, which had a negative impact on our results in 2020 and 2021. While many restrictions have been relaxed at this point, there are no assurances that a resurgence of future COVID-19 variants will not cause similar disruptions that existed in 2020 and 2021. In addition, future demand for gaming activities may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth or reduced business spending due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business would also be impacted if the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic impact construction projects, including our project in Centre County, Pennsylvania. There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these disruptions, such as fixed property costs, reduced access to construction labor and unavailability of construction materials due to supply chain delays. Government measures intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as mandatory quarantines, vaccine mandates and regular testing requirements, could also impact the availability of our employees or other workers or could lead to attrition of key employees or reduced willingness of customers to come to our properties. Any of these factors may continue to disrupt our ability to staff our business adequately and could continue to generally disrupt our operations or construction projects.\nWe may experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of labor shortages, illness, absenteeism or government orders), access to supplies, capital and fundamental support services. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting supply chain disruptions and economic conditions. Furthermore, the impacts of potential worsening of global economic conditions, inflation resulting from government interventions and stimulus and continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.\nGiven the uncertainty around the extent and timing of any potential future spread or mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions from time to time in discretionary consumer spending. Demand for entertainment and leisure activities, including gaming, can be affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, sustained high levels of unemployment and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions, may reduce our users\u2019 disposable income or result in fewer individuals engaging in entertainment and leisure activities, such as visiting casinos and casino hotel properties,P, DFS, sports betting, iCasino and online bingo. Moreover, we rely on the strength of regional and local economies in the US for the performance of each of our properties. As a result, we cannot ensure that demand for our offerings will remain constant. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world including a general tightening of the availability of credit, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, significant declines in the stock market or epidemics, pandemics or other health-related events or widespread illnesses, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to a reduction in visitors to our properties, including those that stay in our hotels, or discretionary spending by our customers on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition\nThe gaming industry, including retail casinos and iGaming, is very competitive and increased competition, including through legislative legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we own facilities or through Native American gaming facilities, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe face significant competition in all of the areas in which we conduct our business. Increased competitive pressures may adversely affect our ability to continue to attract customers or affect our ability to compete efficiently.\nSeveral of our casinos and resorts are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas and/or may be affected by state laws that currently prohibit or restrict gaming operations. We also face the risk that existing casino licensees will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow. Budgetary and other political pressures faced by state governments could lead to intensified efforts directed at the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is currently prohibited. The legalization of gaming in such jurisdictions could be an expansion opportunity for our business, or create competitive pressures, depending on where the legalization occurs and our ability to capitalize on it. Our ability to attract customers to the existing casinos which we own could be significantly and adversely affected by the legalization or expansion of gaming in certain jurisdictions and by the development or expansion of Native American casinos in areas where our customers may visit.\nIn addition, our competitors may refurbish, rebrand or expand their casino offerings, which could result in increased competition. Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in improved quality of our competitors\u2019 facilities, which may make such facilities more competitive. Certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions can be expected. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at the corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull-tab games, card parlors, sportsbooks, pari-mutuel or simulcast betting on horse and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, instant racing machines, VLTs (including racetracks that offer VLTs) and video poker terminals and, in the future, we may compete with gaming or entertainment at other venues. Further competition from Internet lotteries and other Internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert customers from the facilities we own and thus adversely affect our business. Such Internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of US Department of Justice positions related to the application of federal laws to intrastate Internet gaming and initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate Internet wagering. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of Internet gaming in the US.\nIn addition, in May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling. This decision has the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports wagering and thus allows states to determine by themselves the legality of sports wagering. While new federal online gaming legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time, there has been no federal legislative response to the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nAs a result, numerous states, including states in which we have casino properties, have passed legislation authorizing fixed-odds sports betting, and certain of our properties now offer sports wagering pursuant to state law in each case.\nWe may also face competition from other gaming facilities which are able to offer sports wagering services (including mobile sports wagering) following the enactment of applicable legislation. Numerous states that border the states in which we operate have pending or proposed legislation which would allow for sports betting, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe online gambling industry is highly competitive and we expect more competitors to enter the sector. With several thousand online gambling sites accessible to potential customers around the world with little product differentiation, there is arguably an excess of suppliers. Online and offline advertising is widespread, with operators competing for affiliates and customers who are attracted by sign-up bonuses and other incentives.\nExisting and new competitors may also increase marketing spending, including to unprofitable levels, in an attempt to distort the online gambling market to build market share quickly. Some of our competitors have or will have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and sales resources and may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer needs. Additionally, these competitors may be able to devote a greater number of resources to the enhancement, promotion and sale of their games and gaming systems. Our future success is or will be dependent upon its ability to retain its current customers and to acquire new customers. Failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ownership and operation of casino gaming, horse racing facilities, sports betting, VLTs and online offerings are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of these businesses, and may revoke, suspend, condition, fail to renew or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present operations, but must periodically apply to renew many of these licenses and registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees renewed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such renewals or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly and we cannot be sure that we will be successful. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted in jurisdictions where we operate, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.\nGaming authorities in the US generally can require that any beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.\nOur officers, directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. If any applicable gaming authority were to find any of our officers, directors or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the applicable gaming authority may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could adversely affect our gaming operations.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations may restrict our ability to issue certain securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require notice and/or approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. Applicable gaming laws further limit our ability to engage in certain competitive activities and impose requirements relating to the composition of our Board and senior management personnel. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws that may expose us to liabilities or have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Changes to any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for alcoholic beverages, thus negatively impacting sales of our alcoholic beverages at our properties. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increases in taxes or fees or the adoption of additional taxes, fees or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation in various forms to ban or substantially curtail indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including some of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking restrictions can significantly impact business volumes. If additional smoking restrictions are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do business, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.\nWe handle significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Recently, US governmental authorities have evidenced an increased focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the gaming industry. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreement could result in a breach and could harm our business.\nWe are currently a party to the Regulatory Agreement with Rhode Island regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us. For more detail on the Regulatory Agreement see the section entitled \u201cGovernment Gaming Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem I. Business.\u201d A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island. Any such remedy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any gaming facilities in Rhode Island (other than Bally\u2019s Twin River and Bally\u2019s Tiverton), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, which may adversely affect our growth and market opportunity in those states.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include US Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In addition, our horse racing facility in Colorado is subject to state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations (\u201cCAFO\u201d) on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. For example, we may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from our property. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such materials may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, as an owner or manager of real property, we could be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination at or emanating from third-party sites. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or manager knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. In addition, environmental requirements address the impacts of development on wetlands.\nThe possibility exists that contamination, as yet unknown, may exist on our properties. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenditures for environmental investigations or remediation in the future.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our businesses. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, shareholders, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe or certain third parties that we rely on may fail to establish and maintain effective and compliant anti-money laundering, counter terrorism financing, safer gambling, fraud detection, risk management and other regulatory policies, procedures and controls.\nOnline gambling operators licensed in the UK and other jurisdictions are obliged to establish and maintain compliant anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d), anti-terrorism, safer gambling, fraud detection, risk management and other regulatory policies, procedures and controls to mitigate and effectively manage these risks. In the event that they fail to do so, they may be subject to enforcement action by gambling regulators or other governmental agencies or private action by affected third parties. In the event of a breach, a range of sanctions may be imposed, including financial penalties or regulatory settlements, public warnings, the imposition of special operating conditions and the suspension or revocation of gambling licenses.\nIn recent years the British gambling regulator, the Great Britain Gambling Commission (the \u201cGBGC\u201d), has repeatedly stated that the UK\u2019s online gambling industry needed to take greater steps to implement effective AML and safer gambling policies and procedures. By way of example, in January 2018, the GBGC sent a letter to operators in the UK\u2019s online casino sector indicating that the GBGC had identified significant concerns about the effectiveness of the online casino sector\u2019s management and mitigation of AML and safer gambling risks. The GBGC indicated that it had already started investigations into 17 remote operators and was considering whether to undertake a license review of five operators with a view to exercising the GBGC\u2019s regulatory powers. The GBGC re-emphasized its focus in this compliance area and the risk of license revocations in its enforcement report for 2018 and 2019. The GBGC has imposed financial penalties or regulatory settlements in lieu of a penalty on a number of different operators for failing to apply effective AML and/or safer gambling policies and procedures, including Gamesys, our wholly owned subsidiary.\nIn addition, there is a risk that increased safer gambling and AML regulatory measures in the UK will prove to be challenging for us. For example, our highest value customers may be unwilling to provide the additional detail required by us in the UK to ascertain their sources of wealth, the affordability of their leisure spending with us or their risk of gambling related harm or vulnerability, and to continue to verify such information. The GBGC is also consulting on tougher rules for online gambling operators for identifying and tackling gambling harm, including customer affordability, for all UK customers. The GBGC may impose requirements for a gambling business to act on information they have about a customer\u2019s vulnerability and to assess whether a customer\u2019s gambling is affordable at thresholds which will be set by the GBGC. The imposition of such requirements will significantly impact our business as we may be unable to establish the affordability of customers on the basis of available evidence and/or because customers are unwilling to provide the information requested.\nThe failure by any third-party providers or any relevant entity within the Company to establish and maintain effective and compliant AML, counter terrorism, anti-bribery, fraud detection, regulatory compliance and risk management processes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework which governs our business, and its interpretation, may be subject to change which we may fail to anticipate and/or respond to.\nWe hold licenses issued by the GBGC. The holders of such licenses are bound to meet stringent compliance requirements relating to matters such as anti-money laundering, safer gambling, data protection, advertising and consumer rights issues. Compliance with such requirements is incorporated into the relevant licenses as a licensing condition (or similar) with a corresponding requirement for us to comply with such onerous requirements.\nIn carrying out its functions, the GBGC is under a statutory duty to ensure that license holders are operating their businesses in ways that are reasonably consistent with the licensing objectives set out in the Gambling Act 2005 (the primary legislation governing the licensing and regulation of gambling in Great Britain) (the \u201cGambling Act\u201d), which are: (1) preventing gambling from being a source of (or associated with) crime or disorder, or being used to support crime; (2) ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and (3) protecting children and other vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by gambling.\nWhile the objectives of regulation may remain largely stable, the methods that operators are required to employ to meet those objectives is in a state of constant evolution and development. We must respond adequately to the challenges this presents. If we are found to be in breach of our obligation to comply with such licensing requirements, then the GBGC may impose a financial penalty on us or impose other penalties, including removing or imposing conditions on the relevant gambling licenses. Such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nNew legislation governing the online gaming industry may be introduced in the UK which limits or restricts our operating model in that market.\nIn December 2020, the UK government commenced a review of the Gambling Act. The stated objective of the UK government is to ensure there is an appropriate balance between consumer freedoms and choice on the one hand and the prevention of harm to vulnerable groups on the other, and to ensure that consumers are suitably protected whenever they gamble. The review of the Gambling Act is extensive in scope. Key areas under review are:\n\u2022the effectiveness of the existing online protections in preventing gambling harm and an evidence-based consideration of, for example, imposing greater control on online product design such as stake, speed and prize limits and the introduction of deposit, loss and spend limits;\n\u2022the benefits or harms caused by allowing licensed gambling operators to advertise and make promotional offers and the positive or negative impact of gambling sponsorship arrangements across sports, e-sports and other areas;\n\u2022the effectiveness of the regulatory system currently in place, including consideration of whether the GBGC has sufficient investigative, enforcement and sanctioning powers to both regulate the licensed market and address the unlicensed market;\n\u2022the availability and suitability of redress arrangements in place for an individual consumer who considers they may have been treated unfairly by a gambling operator, including consideration of the introduction of other routes for consumer redress, such as a gambling ombudsman; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of current measures to prevent illegal underage gambling and consideration of what extra protections may be needed for young adults in the 18-25 age bracket.\nThe UK government launched a 16-week call for evidence which closed on March 31, 2021. Its findings will be informed by the data from the call for evidence. It is anticipated that the UK government will issue its conclusions and any proposals to amend the Gambling Act in the first half of 2022. As yet, the implications for the industry as a whole and us, in particular, remain the subject of speculation. A variety of stakeholders continue to lobby the UK government and the policies to be pursued by the legislature have yet to be published. There is a risk that the introduction of more stringent, safer gambling and/or AML regulatory measures in the UK market may prove operationally onerous for us. Moreover, the potential for the introduction of stake, speed and prize limits and the introduction of deposit, loss and spend limits may operate to impact our financial performance and reduce the long-term growth opportunities for us in the UK market.\nOur business is subject to a variety of US and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business across jurisdictions. Any change in existing regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory or prosecutorial climate applicable to our products and services, or changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to our products and services, could adversely impact our ability to operate our business as currently conducted or as we seek to operate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally subject to laws and regulations relating to iGaming in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, as well as the general laws and regulations that apply to all e-commerce businesses, such as those related to privacy and personal information, tax and consumer protection. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction, and future legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental action, which may be affected by, among other things, political pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. Some jurisdictions have introduced regulations attempting to restrict or prohibit online gaming, while others have taken the position that online gaming should be licensed and regulated and have adopted or are in the process of considering legislation and regulations to enable that to happen. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFuture legislative and regulatory action, and court decisions or other governmental action, may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. Governmental authorities could view us as having violated local laws, despite our efforts to obtain all applicable licenses or approvals. There is also risk that civil and criminal proceedings, including class actions brought by or on behalf of prosecutors or public entities or incumbent monopoly providers, or private individuals, could be initiated against us, Internet service providers, credit card and other payment processors in the iGaming industry. Such potential proceedings could involve substantial litigation expense, penalties, fines, seizure of assets, injunctions or other restrictions being imposed upon our licensees or other business partners, while diverting the attention of key executives. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as impact our reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that legally enforceable legislation will not be proposed and passed in jurisdictions relevant or potentially relevant to our business to prohibit, legislate or regulate various aspects of the iGaming (or that existing laws in those jurisdictions will not be interpreted negatively). Compliance with any such legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, either as a result of our determination that a jurisdiction should be blocked or because a local license or approval may be costly for us or our business partners to obtain and/or such licenses or approvals may contain other commercially undesirable conditions.\nOur growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions and legalization may not occur in as many jurisdictions as we expect, or may occur at a slower pace than we anticipate. Additionally, even if jurisdictions legalize real money gaming, this may be accompanied by legislative or regulatory restrictions and/or taxes that make it impracticable or less attractive to operate in those jurisdictions, or the process of implementing regulations or securing the necessary licenses to operate in a particular jurisdiction may take longer than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our future results of operations and make it more difficult to meet our expectations for financial performance.\nSeveral jurisdictions have legalized or are currently evaluating the legalization of real money gaming, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects are significantly dependent upon the status of legalization in these jurisdictions. Our business plan is partially based upon the legalization of real money gaming in additional jurisdictions and the legalization may not occur as anticipated. Additionally, if a large number of additional jurisdictions enact real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain, or are otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate iGaming websites in jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in iGaming could be materially impaired.\nAs we enter new jurisdictions, governments may legalize real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. As a result, we may encounter legal, regulatory and political challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new opportunity. Jurisdictions also impose substantial tax rates on iGaming revenue. Tax rates, whether federal- or state-based, that are higher than we expect will make it more costly and less desirable for us to launch in a given jurisdiction, while tax increases in any of our existing jurisdictions may adversely impact profitability.\nTherefore, even in cases in which a jurisdiction purports to license and regulate iGaming, the licensing and regulatory regimes can vary considerably in terms of business-friendliness, and at times may be intended to provide incumbent operators with advantages over new licensees. Therefore, some \u201cliberalized\u201d regulatory regimes are considerably more economically viable than others.\nWe derive meaningful revenues from players located in jurisdictions in which we do not hold a license.\nIn certain jurisdictions, online gambling is either not regulated at all, is subject to very limited regulation or its legality is unclear. These jurisdictions are commonly referred to in the gaming industry as \u201cunregulated jurisdictions.\u201d Certain of our products are made available to players in unregulated jurisdictions. The relevant transactions in such unregulated jurisdictions and the associated player relationships that underpin them are generally regulated in either Malta or Gibraltar which use \u201cpoint of supply\u201d gambling regimes. We and our commercial partners hold point-of-supply licenses in Malta and Gibraltar. Therefore, such transactions are in fact heavily regulated but are not themselves regulated in the jurisdiction within which the player is ultimately located.\nOperators within the online gambling industry, including Bally\u2019s, have commonly taken a risk-based approach when supplying their online gambling services into jurisdictions in which it is not possible to obtain a gambling license. In these circumstances, online gambling operators may justify their remote supply of gambling services for a number of reasons, including a \u201ccountry of origin\u201d basis which asserts that it is lawful to supply online gambling services remotely from a jurisdiction in which a gambling license is held in another jurisdiction, unless there is something within the laws of that second jurisdiction that explicitly outlaws such provision and explicitly applies to such inward supply emanating from outside its borders. An example of this is Japan. Japan has been a focus of our international interactive segment and has yet to introduce its own licensing regime applicable to our business.\nThere is a risk that such jurisdictions may enact regulations relating to online real money gaming and that we may be required to register our activities or obtain licenses (or obtain further registrations or licenses, as applicable), pay taxes, royalties or fees or that the operation of online gambling businesses in such jurisdictions may be prohibited entirely. The implementation of additional licensing or regulatory requirements, prohibitions or payments in such jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on the viability of our revenue, operations, business or financial performance. Where we or our partners fail to obtain the necessary registrations or licenses, make the necessary payments or operate in a jurisdiction where online gambling is deemed to be or becomes prohibited, we or our partners may be subject to investigation, penalties or sanctions or forced to discontinue operations entirely in relation to that jurisdiction. Any such actions may also have an adverse impact on the way our regulators regulate us in the jurisdictions in which we hold licenses.\nCertain of our technology providers, payment processing partners or other suppliers of content or services (collectively, \u201cInfrastructure Services\u201d) may cease to provide, or limit the availability of, such Infrastructure Services to the extent we derive revenue from, or makes such Infrastructure Services available to customers in, unregulated jurisdictions. There is no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable or economical replacements if such Infrastructure Services become unavailable.\nThere is also a risk that civil and criminal proceedings, including class actions brought by or on behalf of prosecutors or public entities, incumbent monopoly providers or private individuals, could be initiated against us or providers of our Infrastructure Services in unregulated markets. Such potential proceedings could assert that online gambling services have not been lawfully supplied into the domestic market and could involve substantial litigation expense, penalties, fines, seizure of assets, injunctions or other restrictions being imposed on us or our business partners and may divert the attention of our key executives. If we become subject to any such investigations, proceedings and/or penalties in one jurisdiction, this may lead to investigations, proceedings and/or penalties arising in other jurisdictions in which we operate and/or hold a license. Such investigations, proceedings and/or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our reputation. We derive meaningful revenues from players located in jurisdictions in which we do not hold a license.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate risks.\nForeign exchange risk arises when individual group entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. Our policy is, where possible, to allow our entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Where our entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within Bally\u2019s. Apart from these particular cash flows, we aim to fund expenses and investments in the respective currency and to manage foreign exchange risk at a local level by matching the currency in which revenue is generated and expenses are incurred, as well as by matching the currency of our debt structure with the currency that cash is generated in. However, no assurance can be given that these policies will deliver all, or substantially all, of the expected benefits.\nA vast majority of the revenues currently generated by Gamesys, our wholly owned subsidiary, are from the UK market and are conducted in British Pound Sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and are therefore susceptible to any movements in exchange rates between GBP and US Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). Any exchange rate risk may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial activities in foreign jurisdictions may be affected by factors outside of our control.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted in non-US jurisdictions. As such, our operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign government policies and legislation (including gambling legislation) or social instability and other factors that are not within our control, including renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or licenses, changes in gambling policies, regulatory requirements or the personnel administering them, currency fluctuations and devaluations, exchange controls, economic sanctions, tax increases, retroactive tax claims, changes in taxation policies, risk of terrorist activities, revolution, border disputes, implementation of tariffs and other trade barriers and protectionist practices, volatility of financial markets and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, difficulties in the protection of intellectual property, labor disputes and other risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which operations are conducted. Our operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of such foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. Accordingly, our activities in foreign jurisdictions could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event of a dispute arising in connection with operations in a foreign jurisdiction where we conduct business, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of the courts of the UK or enforcing UK judgments in such other jurisdictions. We may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing their rights with respect to a governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\nWe may also enter into agreements and conduct activities outside of the jurisdictions in which we currently carry on business, which expansion may present challenges and risks as a result of the factors described above that we have not faced in the past, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and the wider political climate may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a multinational group with worldwide operations, including material revenues derived from the UK. The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d) which has resulted, and the medium- and long-term consequences of Brexit may result, in significant economic, political and social instability, not only in the UK and Europe, but across the globe generally. In particular, this has led to volatility in the value of GBP, which may affect our profitability. These developments and the prevailing uncertainty relating to these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and economic conditions in the UK in particular, and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility.\nDespite a new free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or maintain, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital and impact revenues. In particular, Brexit may lead to material changes to the regulatory regimes that would be applicable to our operations in the UK in the future. This could increase our compliance and operating costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther economic, political and social instability may also result from the Scottish public voting for Scotland to leave the UK in any future referendum. Scotland\u2019s First Minister has tabled draft legislation to set the rules for a second independence referendum (though any such referendum would be subject to UK government approval). The implications of any vote in favor of independence are uncertain, but could still be wide-ranging (for instance, in affecting the value of GBP, global markets and the ongoing relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK and, potentially, the introduction of a discrete gambling regulatory regime in Scotland). Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur activities are affected by the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nWe are required to comply with the GDPR to the extent that we either: (1) have customers located in the UK and the EU or (2) conduct the processing of personal data in the EU. The impact of the GDPR is of particular relevance to our marketing activities and information technology security systems and procedures. The GDPR and associated e-privacy laws impose constraints on the ability of a data controller to profile and market to customers. Data subjects have the right to object to a controller processing their data in certain circumstances, including the right to object to their data being processed for the purposes of direct marketing. Controllers of personal data are required to maintain written records as to how they comply with the GDPR and provide more detailed information to data subjects in relation to how their data is being processed. In addition, updated e-privacy laws are under consideration in the EU to update the legislative rules applicable to digital and online data processing and to align e-privacy laws to the GDPR.\nThe GDPR also increased the level of fines which may be imposed for a breach of data protection laws, with the maximum fine (in the most serious cases of a breach of the GDPR) being the higher of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million for the UK) or four percent of annual worldwide turnover. In certain instances, we could be held jointly responsible for breaches committed by the third-party service providers which we use or by other third parties with whom we share personal data.\nMany of the obligations imposed on controllers by the GDPR are expressed as high-level principles, such as the obligation to act fairly with respect to the processing of personal data. The manner in which the data regulators and courts will interpret and apply the GDPR is and will continue to evolve over time. These procedures and policies may adversely affect our business by constraining our data processing activities or by increasing our operational and compliance costs. Additional updates to these policies and procedures and associated operational changes may be required and costs incurred to comply with updates to e-privacy laws.\nIf our or any third-party service providers\u2019 data processing activities breach the GDPR (or associated e-privacy laws), then we could, whether as a result of a failure to implement adequate policies and procedures or otherwise, face significant fines and/or the revocation of existing licenses and/ or the refusal of new applications for licenses, as well as claims by customers and reputational damage. The resultant losses suffered could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that we would be able to recoup such losses, whether in whole or in part, from our third-party service providers or insurers.\nBusiness Operational Risks\nWe have expanded our business model, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results, creates uncertainty as to how investors will evaluate our prospects, and increases the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe have expanded our product offering to include sportsbook and iGaming product offerings. In November 2020, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with Sinclair that combines our sports betting technology with their local broadcast television stations and regional sports networks. During 2021, our acquisitions included Bet.Works Corp, MKF, SportCaller, AVP, Telescope and Gamesys. These acquisitions represent an expanded business model and new offerings. Accordingly, it will be difficult for us to forecast our future financial results, and it will be uncertain how our expanded business model will affect investors\u2019 perceptions and expectations, which can be idiosyncratic and vary widely, with respect to our prospects. It may be difficult for investors to evaluate our business due to the lack of similarly situated competitors. Furthermore, our expanded business model may not be successful. Consequently, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of our future financial performance, and our financial results and stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe will be reliant on effective payment processing services from a limited number of providers in each of the markets in which we operate.\nThe provision of convenient, trusted, fast and effective payment processing services to our customers and potential customers is critical to our business. If there is any deterioration in the quality of the payment processing services provided to these customers or any interruption to those services (including with respect to system intrusions, unauthorized access or manipulation), or if such services are only available at an increased cost to us or our customers or are terminated and no timely and comparable replacement services are found, our customers and potential customers may be deterred from using our products. In addition, our inability to secure payment processing services in markets into which we intend to expand may seriously impair our growth opportunities and strategies. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, a limited number of banks and credit card companies process online gambling related payments as a matter of internal policy and any capacity to accept such payments may be limited by the regulatory regime of a given jurisdiction. The introduction of legislation or regulations restricting financial transactions with online gambling operators, other prohibitions or restrictions on the use of credit cards and other banking instruments for online gambling transactions may restrict our ability to accept payments from our customers. These restrictions may be imposed as a result of concerns related to fraud, payment processing, AML or other issues related to the provision of online gambling services. A number of issuing banks or credit card companies may from time to time reject payments to us that are attempted to be made by our customers. Should such restrictions and rejections become more prevalent, or any other restriction on payment processing be introduced, gambling activity by our customers could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk of credit card chargebacks, which may also result in possible penalties. A chargeback is a credit card originated deposit transaction to a player account with an operator that is later reversed or repudiated. The risk of such chargeback transactions is greater in respect of certain markets and certain payment methods. We recognize revenue upon the first loss of the player on amounts tendered, and any credit card chargebacks are then deducted from their revenues. Even though security measures are in place, high rates of credit card chargebacks could result in credit card associations levying additional costs and fines or withdrawing their service and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur VLTs and table games hold percentages may fluctuate.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance and our casino guests\u2019 winnings depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the element of chance, hold percentages (the ratio of net win to total amount wagered) are affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. The variability of our hold percentages has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability will be dependent, in part, on return to players.\nThe revenue from certain of our gaming products depends on the outcome of random number generators built into the gaming software running the games made available to customers. Return to player is measured by dividing the amount of real money won by players on a particular game by the total real money wagers over a particular period on that game. An increasing return to player may negatively affect revenue as it represents a larger amount of money being won by players. Return to player is driven by the overall random number generator outcome, the mechanics of different games and jackpot winnings. Each game utilizes a random number generating engine; however, generally the return to player fluctuates in the short-term based on large wins or jackpots or a large share of wagers made for higher-payout games. To the extent we are unable to set, or fail to obtain, a favorable return to player in our (or a third-party supplier\u2019s) gambling software which maximizes revenue, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success, including win or hold rates, of existing or future sports betting and iGaming products depends on a variety of factors and is not completely controlled by us.\nThe sports betting and iGaming industries are characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of sports bet or iGame, on average, will win or lose in the long run. Net win is impacted by variations in the hold percentages, or actual outcomes, on our iGames and sports betting we offer to our users. We use the hold percentages as an indicator of an iGame\u2019s or sports bet\u2019s performance against its expected outcome. Although each iGame or sports bet generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary for any given period. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) may also (depending on the game involved) be affected by the spread of limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a user\u2019s skill, experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of users, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time spent gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates on our online iGames and sports bets may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our iGame\u2019s or sports bet\u2019s users exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and satisfy user preferences in a timely manner. As we will operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing industry and legal standards, our products will be subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We will need to continually introduce new offerings and identify future product offerings that complement our existing platforms, respond to our users\u2019 needs and improve and enhance our existing platforms to maintain or increase our user engagement and growth of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industries in which we compete, or trends in new gaming products.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table game players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \u201cmarker,\u201d and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all US states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the US Constitution; however, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the US of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from US courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nDeclining popularity of games and changes in device preferences of players could have a negative effect on our business.\nRevenue from online games tends to decline over time after reaching a peak of popularity and player usage. The speed of this decline is referred to as the decay rate of a game. As a result of this natural decline in the life cycle of our products, our business depends on our ability and the ability of our third-party partners to consistently and timely launch new games across multiple platforms and devices that achieve significant popularity. Our ability to successfully launch, sustain and expand games as applicable, largely will depend on our ability to, amongst other things: (1) anticipate and effectively respond to changing game player interests and preferences; (2) anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape; (3) develop, sustain and expand games that are fun, interesting and compelling to play; (4) minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new games; (5) minimize downtime and other technical difficulties; (6) acquire leading technology and high quality personnel; and (7) comply with constraints on game design and/or functionality imposed by regulators. There is a risk that we may not launch any new games according to schedule, or that those games do not attract and retain a significant number of players, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, more individuals are using non-PC/laptop devices to access the Internet and versions of our technology developed for these devices may not be widely adopted by users of such devices. The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile telephones, tablets and television set-top devices, has increased over the past several years. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device users to our gambling services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with non-PC/laptop communications devices relative to our competitors, we may fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online gambling services.\nIn addition to offering popular new games, we must extend the life of the existing games which we make available to users, in particular the most successful games. While it is difficult to predict when revenues from any such existing games will begin to decline, for a game to remain popular, we must constantly enhance, expand or upgrade the relevant game with new features that players find attractive. There is a risk that we may not be successful in enhancing, expanding or upgrading our current games or any new games in the future and, in addition, regulators may introduce new rules that limit functionality within existing games. Should we not succeed in sufficiently offsetting the effects of declining popularity in the games we make available, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe casino, hotel and hospitality industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance development, expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur casino and hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including room refurbishments, amenity upgrades and replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements of casino properties in particular require significant capital expenditures. In addition, any such renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to renovate and maintain gaming and entertainment venues from time to time may put us at a competitive disadvantage to gaming and entertainment venues offering more modern and better maintained facilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may invest in or acquire other businesses, and our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.\nWe cannot assure you that our recently completed, pending or any future acquisitions, will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively translate our strategies into revenue, our ability to retain and assimilate the acquired businesses\u2019 employees, our ability to retain existing customers and suppliers on terms similar to, or better than, those in place with the acquired businesses, our ability to attract new customers, the adequacy of our implementation plans, our ability to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand our operations, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and revenue goals. The integration of the businesses that we acquire might also cause us to incur costs that are unforeseen or that exceed our estimates, which would lower our future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of such acquisitions. In some cases, the services provided by the sellers are critical to the ongoing efficient operation of the properties and may involve costly payments from us to the provider of the services. If the provision of these services by the sellers is disrupted or given insufficient attention by the sellers, our ability to operate the properties may be negatively impacted until such time as we are able to take full control over the services. Moreover, we must pay the sellers for these services and the costs to us for these services may exceed our estimates and these expenses will negatively impact the results of operations of these properties during these transition periods. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions could result in decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results including, ultimately, a reduction in our stock price.\nWe face risks associated with growth and acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. In the future, we may also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures or partnerships, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming.\nAlthough we only intend to engage in acquisitions that, if consummated, will be accretive to us and our shareholders, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and may not result in the full benefits expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process that may negatively impact our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022the inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue increases, cost reductions and other benefits anticipated to result from any acquisitions;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulty addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquisitions.\nAdditionally, even if integration is successful, the overall integration of acquired assets and businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. There is also no guarantee that the acquired assets or businesses will generate any of the projected synergies and earnings growth, and the failure to realize such projected synergies and earnings growth may adversely affect our operating and financial results and derail any growth plans.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved.\nBallot measures or other voter-approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming, or certain types of gaming (such as slots and sports wagering), was not previously permitted could be challenged, and, if such challenges are successful, these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans, and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake, which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures or new business strategies.\nWe have invested in, formed strategic alliances with and announced proposed joint ventures with other companies, such as the proposed joint venture with IGT in Rhode Island (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d), and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies which may require various state approvals which may or may not be granted. These initiatives are typically complex and we may not be able to complete anticipated alliance or joint venture transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized or the benefits may be delayed. For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems. In addition, implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations. Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments in that strategy. Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWith respect to the proposed Joint Venture, any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price, future business and financial results. Moreover, uncertainty about the effect of the proposed transaction on employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners may have an adverse effect on us and the Joint Venture. These uncertainties may impair our and/or the Joint Venture\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel to execute the Joint Venture\u2019s strategy, and could cause customers, suppliers, distributors and others who deal with us and/or the Joint Venture to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us and/or the Joint Venture or fail to renew existing relationships.\nThe Joint Venture will be subject to the risks associated with the Company\u2019s gaming business, approvals by the state of Rhode Island, in addition to the risks associated with IGT\u2019s machine gaming business, and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those currently affecting the independent business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company\u2019s gaming business. Many of these factors are outside of our and the Joint Venture\u2019s control and could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture. Moreover, although we will have certain consent, board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture, the Company will be a minority owner of the Joint Venture. As a result, we will not have control over the Joint Venture, its management or its policies and we may have business interests, strategies and goals that differ in certain respects from those of IGT or the Joint Venture.\nOur growth will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. Overreliance on certain third parties or our inability to extend existing relationships or agree to new relationships may cause unanticipated costs for us and impact our financial performance in the future.\nWe have entered into strategic partnerships with Sinclair, the National Hockey League and others and may enter into relationships with advertisers, casinos and other third parties in order to attract users to our platform. These relationships along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses direct consumers to our platform. In addition, many of the parties with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including other fantasy sports and gaming platforms with whom we compete. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our platform, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fails to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, this could impact our ability to attract consumers cost effectively and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur branded sites are heavily reliant on well-known brands owned by third parties.\nWe operate certain branded sites, including sites branded as Virgin Games, Double Bubble Bingo and Monopoly Casino. All such branded sites operated by us are reliant on the use of highly trusted and recognizable brands which are owned by third parties (the \u201cThird Party Brands\u201d). We operate the Third Party Brands pursuant to brand licensing arrangements with the relevant third party brand owner (the \u201cBrand Owner\u201d). We are contractually required to operate such branded sites in accordance with those brand licensing arrangements, and any material breach of those requirements may expose us to claims for breach of contract and/or may lead to the Brand Owner terminating or failing to renew the brand licensing arrangements. We own the player data in respect of such branded sites, and in the event that the brand licensing arrangements for any of such branded sites were to be terminated early or not renewed, then we would seek to migrate those players to a different gaming site operated by us. However, there is a risk that any replacement branded site offered by us may not successfully retain the custom of those players, and in the event that we lose the right to use any of the Third Party Brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the risk that the reputation of the Third Party Brands may be adversely affected by the activities of third parties over whom we have no control. For example, we operate the Virgin Games site. The Virgin brand is used by a wide range of businesses. In the event that the reputation of the Virgin brand was to be adversely affected due to the actions of third parties, that may affect our business prospects.\nWe conduct our business in an industry that is subject to high taxes and may be subject to higher taxes in the future.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, with the exception of Rhode Island, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. In Rhode Island, the state takes all of the gaming win that comes into our Rhode Island operations and then pays us a percentage of the gaming win. We also pay property taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability will depend on generating enough revenues to cover variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases could significantly impact the profitability of our gaming operations.\nOur operations in other states are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. In addition, from time to time, federal, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Further, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of applicable state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could adversely affect our future financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that governments in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. General economic pressures have the potential to reduce revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nFuture changes to US and non-US tax laws could adversely affect our business.\nThe US Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where Bally\u2019s and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d including situations where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the US, the UK and other countries in which Bally\u2019s and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect Bally\u2019s and its affiliates.\nIn addition, the US government may enact significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase in the corporate income tax rate, an increase in the tax rate applicable to global intangible low-taxed income, the elimination of certain tax exemptions and the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income. No specific US tax legislation has been proposed at this time and the likelihood of these changes being enacted or implemented is unclear. We are currently unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business.\nIf we fail to detect fraud, theft or cheating, including by our users and employees, our reputation may suffer which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and can subject us to investigations and litigation.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of financial fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of unauthorized payments by a user and attempted payments by users with insufficient funds. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for use of funds on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction.\nActs of fraud may involve various tactics, including collusion. Successful exploitation of our systems could have negative effects on our product offerings, services and user experience and could harm our reputation. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in harm to our operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our existing platform or product offerings, substantial engineering and marketing resources and management attention, may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nIn addition, any misappropriation of, or access to, users\u2019 or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, force us to modify our business practices, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from our users, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite measures we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nIn addition, our officers, directors and key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. The time and effort needed to successfully complete the application process could impact our ability to attract, hire and retain top talent.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, our operations may be disrupted by strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions.\nMost of our employees in Rhode Island and New Jersey are represented by a labor union and are subject to collective bargaining agreements with us. As of December 31, 2021, we had 22 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 2,364 employees. All collective bargaining agreements have either been renegotiated for a three- or five-year term or extended until 2022. There can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements. We may also face organizing activities that could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of our workforce during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer defined benefit pension plans to which we are a party may adversely affect us.\nWe must contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\u2022assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\n\u2022if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\n\u2022if we choose to stop participating in some of our multi-employer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIn addition, the funding obligations for our pension plans will be impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and in the first quarter of 2022 have displayed meaningful volatility and, therefore, our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We annually review goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-lived assets or the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or reporting unit, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future.\nCasino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and may cause snowfall, flooding and other effects that result in the closure of our properties. In addition, our sports betting business may experience seasonality based on the relative popularity of certain sports at different parts of the year. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our properties and a reduction in our revenues. We may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as we could experience potentially higher utility, fuel and transportation costs.\nOur insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that we believe is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities, including employee healthcare benefits, up to certain stop-loss amounts which limit our exposure above the amounts we have self-insured. We estimate the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks we retain. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a considerable degree of variability. A considerable increase in claims as a result of a pandemic, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If actual losses incurred are greater than those anticipated, our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. If we suffer a substantial loss that exceeds our self-insurance reserves, and any excess insurance coverage, the loss and attendant expenses could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or underinsured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi properties are located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the US and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather such as hurricanes, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nWe rely on information technology and other systems and platforms, and any failures, errors, defects or disruptions in our systems or platforms could diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability, disrupt our business, affect our ability to scale our technical infrastructure and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe, or one of our state regulatory bodies, engage a number of third parties to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we own. As a result, we rely on such third parties to provide uninterrupted services in order to run our business efficiently and effectively. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services (whether due to technological or financial difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption to the wagering activity at the casinos which we own and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our user base and engagement continue to grow, and the amount and types of offerings continue to grow and evolve, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our users\u2019 needs. Such infrastructure expansion may be complex, and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. As such, we could fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures resulting from adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, cyber-attacks, public health emergencies (such as the coronavirus) or other catastrophic events. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations, cloud computing and lottery systems.\nWe believe that if our users have a negative experience with our offerings, or if our brand or reputation is negatively affected, users may be less inclined to continue or resume utilizing our products or recommend our platform to other potential users. As such, a failure or significant interruption in our service would harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nWe are reliant on the reliability and viability of Internet infrastructure, which is out of our control, and the proper functioning of our own network systems.\nThe growth of Internet usage has caused interruptions and delays in processing and transmitting data over the Internet. There can be no assurance that Internet infrastructure or our own network systems will continue to be able to support the demands placed on them by the continued growth of the Internet, the overall online gambling industry or that of our customers. The Internet\u2019s viability could be affected by delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of Internet activity or by increased government regulation. The introduction of legislation or regulations requiring Internet service providers in any jurisdiction to block access to our websites and products may restrict the ability of our customers to access products and services offered by us. Such restrictions, should they be imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet are not favorably resolved (including security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility and quality of service), if the necessary infrastructure is not sufficient or if other technologies and technological devices eclipse the Internet as a viable channel, this may negatively affect Internet usage, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, the increasing presence of viruses and cyber-attacks may affect the viability and infrastructure of the Internet and/or the proper functioning of our network systems and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be harmed from cybersecurity incidents and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third-party service providers. We have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems, or those of service providers and business partners, that maintain and transmit customer or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our customers\u2019 or employee\u2019s information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, third-party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information or customer, supplier and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancing Risks\nOur debt agreements and the Regulatory Agreement contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur current debt agreements and the Regulatory Agreement include, and our future debt agreements and regulatory agreements will likely include, numerous financial and other covenants, imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. The failure to comply with a financial covenant or other restriction contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness or in the Regulatory Agreement may result in an event of default under such agreements or sanctions or fines under the Regulatory Agreement. An event of default under our debt agreements could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness as well as other indebtedness of ours and the inability to borrow additional funds. We do not have, and cannot be certain we would be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated. Restrictions in our debt agreements or in the Regulatory Agreement might affect our ability to operate our business, might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.53 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $1.945 billion outstanding under our term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement we entered into on October 1, 2021 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto, and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.625% senior notes due 2029 and 5.875% senior notes due 2031 (collectively, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, we have a $620.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d or \u201cRevolver\u201d and, together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), of which there were $85.0 million in borrowings as of that date. This indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to satisfy obligations;\n\u2022increasing vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we conduct business;\n\u2022increasing vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in industry and economic downturns;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u2022subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u2022limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on outstanding debt;\n\u2022exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under that indebtedness (and other indebtedness of ours) and which, if not cured or waived, could adversely affect us; and\n\u2022affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nThough we have significant amounts of indebtedness outstanding, we have the ability to borrow the entire $620.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and may issue or incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations, including as necessary to execute on our growth strategy. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.\nServicing our indebtedness and funding our other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which will be beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:\n\u2022our future operating performance;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and businesses; and\n\u2022our future operating performance.\nSome of these factors will be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. The inability to generate cash flow could result in us needing to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, including through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. If needed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect Bally\u2019s business and results of operations.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility primarily bear interest based on LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the US Federal Reserve and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. The US Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to USD LIBOR. Our Credit Facility includes provisions addressing the future discontinuation of LIBOR that are broadly consistent with the \u201chardwired\u201d approach recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. Such provisions provide for a transition, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, to a SOFR-based interest rate or, under certain circumstances, interest rates based on another benchmark to be determined, together in each case with certain spread adjustments and other changes necessary to implement such replacement benchmark. At this time, we are not able to predict the effect any modification or discontinuation of LIBOR will have on us, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA market downturn may negatively impact our access to financing.\nSince emergence from a recession over ten years ago, the US economy has been expanding at various growth rates. Such growth could slow or reverse, and another economic downturn could occur, including as a result of a potential resurgence of another COVID-19 variant. A downturn in the financial markets or market volatility (like those now being experienced) could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing (including financing necessary for acquisitions or to refinance our existing indebtedness) on acceptable terms and prices, that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nThere have been and are periods of time when the US securities markets have experienced significant price fluctuations. These price fluctuations may be day-to-day or they may last for extended periods of time. Significant price fluctuations in the securities markets as a whole have caused, and may continue to cause, the market price of our common stock to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Additional factors that could cause fluctuations in, or adversely affect, our stock price or trading volume include:\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the gaming and hotel industries;\n\u2022actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by current shareholders seeking liquidity in the public market;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or significant investors; and\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.\nOur largest shareholder owns a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock.\nStandard General L.P. (\u201cStandard General\u201d), our largest shareholder, beneficially owned 22.1% of our outstanding common stock as of February 14, 2022. Standard General\u2019s Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer serves as the chairman of our Board. Standard General is authorized by Rhode Island regulatory authorities to acquire up to 40% of our outstanding common stock.\nOn January 25, 2022, Standard General proposed to acquire all Bally\u2019s common stock not owned by Standard General or its affiliates at $38.00 per share. The proposal was subject to various conditions, including among others the entry into definitive documents and the approval of a committee of our independent directors. There can be no assurance that any transaction will result or, if so, as to the timing or terms thereof, any alternative transaction or the impact on other shareholders.\nWe are not paying dividends and any decision to do so in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under our debt agreements and the Regulatory Agreement, legal considerations and other factors that our Board deems relevant. If we do not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend upon our future stock price and other forms of returning capital. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company, we will conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends, will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.", "PERMNO": 18425, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "TRWH"}
