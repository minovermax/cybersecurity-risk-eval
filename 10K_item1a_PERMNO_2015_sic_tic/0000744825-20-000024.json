RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nThe COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect Our Business Operations and Financial Condition\nThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and has been declared a national emergency. Many states and municipalities in the United States, including California, have announced aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). Across our business, healthcare resources are being prioritized for the treatment and management of the outbreak. Consequently, there are delays in delivering Gamma Knife, image guided radiation and proton therapy treatments. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, customers, government and third party payors and others may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nA broad, sustained outbreak of COVID-19 will negatively impact our results for the following reasons: (i) operations at medical facilities, including medical professionals and other medical facility employees, may continue to be subject to prolonged closure or shut down; (ii) medical facilities may continue to defer Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments for non-urgent patient cases in order to allocate resources to the care of patients with COVID-19; (iii) patients may continue to defer Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments due to real or perceived concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in a medical facility setting; (iv) deferred Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments may not be rescheduled for a later date; (v) the outbreak materially impacts our operations for a sustained period of time due to the current travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, including at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, which is currently subject to a shelter-in-place order that remains in force until April 7, 2020 and may be extended; and/or (vi) members of the board, management or employee team, some of whom are particularly at-risk for the severe symptoms of COVID-19, or of our small number of other employees, may become ill or have family members who are ill and are absent as a result, or they may elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or facilities.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe Federal Reimbursement Rate for Gamma Knife Treatments Has Fluctuated\nCongress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Prior to April 1, 2013, Medicare\u2019s reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment had been relatively stable. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and financial results.\nThe average Medicare reimbursement rate trends from 2016 to 2020 are outlined below:\nAverage Medicare Reimbursement Rate Trends\nThe Federal Reimbursement Rate for Proton Therapy May Fluctuate\nIn July 2019, CMS issued a proposed rule that would implement a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services. The proposed rule implementing the payment model has not been finalized and consequently the timing and details of the payment model are uncertain. Any reductions in the reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement methodology or administration for radiosurgery and radiation therapy could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s Capital Investment at Each Site is Substantial\nEach Gamma Knife, PBRT or IGRT device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment.\nThe Market for the Gamma Knife is Limited\nThere is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only seven (7) new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 120 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which fifteen (15) units were owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has two idle Gamma Knife units with a cumulative net book value of $943,000. There are currently no commitments to place into service or trade these units in during 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing these idle units or additional units at any sites in the future. The Company\u2019s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.\nThe Company Has a High Level of Debt and May Incur Additional Debt to Finance its Operations\nThe Company\u2019s business is capital intensive. The Company finances its Gamma Knife units through its GKF subsidiary. The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourse to ASHS. The Company financed its first proton therapy unit through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Orlando, and guaranteed the lease financing. The Company\u2019s combined long-term debt and finance leases totaled $15,366,000 as of December 31, 2019 and is collateralized by its Gamma Knife, MEVION S250 and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of the financed equipment. Depending on the Company\u2019s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company\u2019s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company\u2019s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife or MEVION S250 units or other equipment with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.\nA Small Number of Customers Account for a Major Portion of our Revenues\nA limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2019, three (3) customers in total accounted for approximately 50% of the Company\u2019s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company\u2019s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Market for the Company\u2019s Services is Competitive\nThe Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe there are no competitor companies that currently have more than three (3) Gamma Knife units in operation. The Company\u2019s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financing of proton therapy projects. The Company\u2019s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances that the Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customers purchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units.\nThere are Alternatives to the Gamma Knife\nOther radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company installed a Gamma Knife in Lima, Peru in 2017. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company\u2019s inability to operate in those locations.\nNew Technology and Products Could Result in Equipment Obsolescence\nThere is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgraded Gamma Knife which cost approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic Positioning System\u2122 (\u201cAPS\u201d), and therefore involved less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduced a new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Model 4C (\u201cModel 4C\u201d). The cost to upgrade existing units to the Model 4C with APS was approximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which costs approximately $4.5 million plus applicable taxes and duties. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon \u2122. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. Existing model 4Cs of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2020, all the Company\u2019s Gamma Knife units in the United States are Perfexion models and one (1) of these Perfexion units has the Icon upgrade. The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Company Has Invested in a Proton Beam Business\nWe have committed a substantial amount of our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December 2013. The Company\u2019s first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in April 2016. The Company has committed to purchase two (2) additional MEVION S250i systems and has already made deposits of $2,250,000 towards this commitment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance the two additional systems.\nThe Trading Volume of Our Common Stock is Low\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 10,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a more significant active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive to you.", "PERMNO": 13769, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "AMS"}
