These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected materially and adversely by other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial.\nPrices for our products can fluctuate widely and an extended period of low prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets are highly dependent on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be so. We are particularly dependent on Brent crude prices that have been as low as $27.88 per barrel and as high as $115.19 per barrel during the period between 2014 and 2018. Factors affecting oil, natural gas and NGL prices include:\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and global supply and demand;\n\u2022\ndomestic and global inventory levels;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments;\n\u2022\nchanges or disruptions in actual or anticipated production, refining and processing;\n\u2022\nworldwide drilling and exploration activities;\n\u2022\ngovernment energy policies and regulation, including with respect to climate change;\n\u2022\nthe effects of conservation;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other seasonal impacts;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading in derivative contracts;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\ntransportation and storage capacity, bottlenecks and costs in producing areas;\n\u2022\nthe price, availability and acceptance of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nregional market conditions; and\n\u2022\nother matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for these products.\nLower prices could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including:\n\u2022\nreducing our proved oil and gas reserves over time, including as a result of impairments of existing reserves;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to grow or maintain future production;\n\u2022\ncausing a reduction in our borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, which could affect our liquidity;\n\u2022\nreducing our ability to make interest payments or maintain compliance with financial covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which could trigger mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our lenders and bondholders against our assets;\n\u2022\nforcing monetization events and potential issues under our JV arrangements;\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to attract counterparties and enter into commercial transactions, including hedging transactions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to funds through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for asset sales or other monetization transactions or our equity and debt securities.\nA sustained period of low prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce our cash flows from operations and could reduce our borrowing capacity or cause a default under our financing agreements. Under these conditions, if we were unable to improve liquidity through additional financing, asset monetizations, restructuring of our debt obligations, equity issuances or otherwise, cash flow from operations and expected available credit capacity could be insufficient to meet our commitments. Successfully completing these actions could have significant adverse effects such as higher operating and financing costs, loss of certain tax benefits, dilution of equity and further covenant restrictions. Past refinancing activities have resulted in increases in our annual interest expense and future refinancing activities may have the same or greater effect.\nOur hedging program does not provide downside protection for all of our production in 2019 and beyond. As a result, our hedges do not fully protect us from commodity price reductions and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges in the future.\nOur lenders require us to comply with covenants that limit our borrowing capabilities and could restrict our ability to use or access capital.\nOur 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is an important source of our liquidity and we may need to rely on this facility to fund a portion of our future capital and operating costs. Our ability to borrow under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is limited by our borrowing base, the size of our lenders' commitments and our ability to comply with covenants, including a minimum monthly liquidity requirement of $150 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $298 million of available borrowing capacity, before taking into account the minimum monthly liquidity requirement.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the lenders' aggregate commitment under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was $1 billion. The borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is currently set at $2.3 billion and is redetermined each May 1 and November 1. The lenders take into account the $1.3 billion outstanding under our 2017 Credit Agreement in determining the total commitment that could be made available in the future under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. Our lenders determine our borrowing base by reference to the value of our reserves, which is influenced by commodity prices, expected future cash flows and other factors. If our lenders were to reduce our borrowing base significantly, the amount of availability under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility could be reduced which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe financial covenants that we must satisfy under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility include a monthly minimum liquidity test and certain financial ratios that measure our leverage and fixed interest charges on a quarterly basis and the present value of our reserves on a semi-annual basis. These covenants could limit our ability to borrow under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility or obtain additional financing through the capital markets or otherwise. Certain other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness also include financial ratios that are generally less restrictive than our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf we were to breach any of the covenants under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders would be permitted to cease lending under the facility, accelerate the repayment of the outstanding amounts due and foreclose against the assets securing them.\nFor a further description of our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and our other credit agreements, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreements.\nWe have significant indebtedness that could limit our financial and operating flexibility and make us more vulnerable in economic downturns.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the face value of our outstanding long-term consolidated indebtedness was $5.3 billion. Our financing agreements permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness as well as certain other obligations. In addition, we may seek amendments or waivers from our existing lenders and bondholders to the extent we need to incur indebtedness above amounts currently permitted by our financing agreements.\nOur level of indebtedness may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, including:\n\u2022\njeopardizing our ability to execute our business plans;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions related to our business;\n\u2022\nputting us at a disadvantage against competitors that have lower fixed obligations and more cash flow to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain favorable financing for working capital, capital investments and general corporate and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund capital investments, react to competitive pressures and engage in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us;\n\u2022\ndefaulting on commercial agreements with our JV partners; and\n\u2022\nfailing to redeem the interests held by our JV partners.\nOur financing agreements also include covenants that restrict management's discretion to operate our business in certain circumstances. These restrictions include limitations that could affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and granting additional liens;\n\u2022\nrepay junior indebtedness, including our Second Lien Notes and Senior Notes;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into JVs;\n\u2022\npay dividends and making other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nuse the proceeds of asset sales for certain purposes;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrelease collateral.\nThese limitations are further described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreements and the documents governing our indebtedness that are filed with the SEC.\nOur financing agreements, including the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, contain customary cross-default mechanisms that provide that an event of default under any one of those agreements may trigger an event of default under all of those agreements. In such an event, we might not be able to obtain alternative financing or, if we are able to obtain such financing, we might not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, which would negatively affect our ability to implement our business plan, make capital expenditures or finance our operations.\nA significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. Although we have purchased derivative contracts that limit our interest rate exposure for a portion of this indebtedness, a rise in interest rates will increase our interest expense to the extent we do not have interest-rate hedges and could limit our liquidity and our ability to comply with our debt covenants.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other financial needs will depend on our future performance, which is influenced by market, financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow is not sufficient, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or issue additional equity on terms that may be unattractive, if it can be done at all. Failure to make a scheduled payment or to comply with covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations and a default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of all of our debt and foreclosure against assets constituting collateral for our indebtedness.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments, which may include acquisitions. We may be unable to fund these investments which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital investments. Historically, we have funded our capital investments through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and JV arrangements. We seek to manage our capital investments to closely align with projected cash flow from operations. Accordingly, a reduction in projected operating cash flow could cause us to reduce our future capital investments. In general, the ability to execute our capital plan depends on a number of variables, including:\n\u2022the amount of oil, gas and NGLs we are able to produce;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022regulatory and third-party approvals;\n\u2022our ability to timely drill, complete and stimulate wells;\n\u2022our ability to secure equipment, services and personnel; and\n\u2022the availability of external sources of financing.\nFuture capital availability may be reduced by (i) our lenders, (ii) our JV partners, (iii) capital markets constraints, (iv) activist funds or investors or (v) poor stock price performance. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned, which may negatively impact our production levels and development activities and limit our ability to make acquisitions.\nUnless we make sufficient capital investments and conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent we have insufficient cash flow from operations or liquidity to fund those activities. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions that require significant judgment in the evaluation of available information. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, reservoir data may change over time as more information becomes available from development and appraisal activities.\nOur ability to add reserves, other than through acquisitions, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management's control and will affect whether the historical sources of proved reserves additions continue to provide reserves at similar levels.\nGenerally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although over 80% of our 2018 proved reserve estimates were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott Company, L.P., we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate. Reserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows from those reserves depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nproduction and operating costs;\n\u2022\nad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and facilities costs.\nChanges in these variables and assumptions could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions, which could affect our liquidity by reducing the borrowing base under our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions.\nAcquisition and disposition activities and our JVs involve substantial risks.\nOur acquisition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022\nnot fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances;\n\u2022\nbear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties;\n\u2022\nexperience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities that are greater than anticipated; and\n\u2022\nbe exposed to currency, political, marketing, labor and other risks, particularly associated with investments in foreign assets.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy.\nPart of our business strategy involves entering into JVs and divesting non-core assets. Our JVs and disposition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022\nnot be able to realize reasonable prices or rates of return for assets;\n\u2022\nbe required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated;\n\u2022\nexperience increased operating costs; and\n\u2022\nreduce our cash flows if we cannot replace associated revenue.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into new JVs or that JVs will occur in the time frames or with economic terms that we expect. We may also be unable to divest assets on financially attractive terms or at all. Our ability to enter into JVs and sell assets is also limited by the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nIf we are not able to make acquisitions, we may not be able to grow our reserves or develop our properties in a timely manner or at all. If we are not able to sell assets as needed or enter into JVs, we may not be able to generate proceeds to support our liquidity and capital investments. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business is highly regulated and government authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation methods, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and change or delay the implementation of our business plans.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. For example, the jurisdiction and enforcement authority of various state agencies have significantly increased with respect to oil and gas activities in recent years, and these state agencies as well as certain cities and counties have significantly revised their regulations, regulatory interpretations and data collection requirements and plan to issue additional regulations of certain oil and gas activities in 2019. In addition, certain of these federal, state and local laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nSee Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, maintenance, transportation, storage, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, fluid injection and disposal and water recycling and reuse. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or prohibiting certain operations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers, are also highly regulated. For example, various government authorities have sought to restrict the use of oil, natural gas or certain petroleum-based products such as fuels and plastics. Federal and state pipeline safety agencies have adopted or proposed regulations to expand their jurisdiction to include more gas and liquid gathering lines and pipelines and to impose additional mechanical integrity requirements. The state has adopted additional regulations on the storage of natural gas that could affect the demand for or availability of such storage, increase seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we receive from customers.\nCosts of compliance may increase and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and gas operations, including proposed setback distances from other land uses. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, or otherwise restrict our ability to access and develop mineral rights, any of which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nChanges in elected officials could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and gas industry. In 2018, California elected a new governor who took office in January 2019. Many representatives in the Legislature have also changed, with the commencement of a new two-year legislative session. We cannot predict the actions the Governor or Legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and gas industry or the state's economic, fiscal or environmental policies.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risk and uncertainty. We may not drill wells at the times we scheduled, or at all. Wells we do drill may not yield production in economic quantities or generate our expected VCI.\nThe exploration and development of oil and gas properties depend in part on our analysis of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data and processes, including the interpretation of 3D seismic data. This analysis is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. We also bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, unusual geological formations or unexpected pressure or irregularities within formations, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance (including lack of production response to workovers or improved and enhanced recovery efforts) and other associated risks.\nWe allocate capital by reference to a VCI metric. We calculate the VCI of a well or project at the time capital is allocated and frequently re-calculate the VCI after a well or project is completed. VCIs are calculated based on internal estimates of future cash flows and capital investment and are inherently uncertain. Our decisions and ultimate profitability are also affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, available transportation and storage capacity, political resistance and other factors. Our cost of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, maintaining and abandoning wells is also often uncertain.\nOur production cost per barrel is higher than that of many of our peers due to the extraction methods we use, the large number of wells we operate and the effects of our PSC-type contracts. Overruns in budgeted investments is a common risk associated with oil and gas operations.\nAny of the forgoing operational or financial risks could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected VCI or cause a well or project to become uneconomic or less profitable than forecast.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that these exploration drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 14% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2018.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe risk profile for our exploration drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular those exploration drilling locations in unconventional reservoirs, which are in unproven geologic plays. Our ability to profitably drill and develop our identified drilling locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, capital availability, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas or the costs of drilling completing and operating wells in these locations may be higher than initially expected. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. In either case, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOne of our important assets is our acreage in the Monterey shale play in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. The geology of the Monterey shale is highly complex and not uniform due to localized and varied faulting and changes in structure and rock characteristics. As a result, it differs from other shale plays that can be developed in part on the basis of their uniformity. Instead, individual Monterey shale drilling sites may need to be more fully understood and may require a more precise development approach, which could affect the timing, cost and our ability to develop this asset.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above any levels set in certain derivative instruments we may use to manage price risk. For example, in 2018, we settled hedges that had the effect of reducing our realized oil price by $7.51 per barrel. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, some of which are still ongoing. These regulations may affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, the effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. Recently, proposals have been made by U.S. regulators which would implement a new approach for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts under the applicable agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rules, referred to as the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk or SA-CCR. If adopted as proposed, certain financial institutions would be required to comply with the new SA-CCR rules beginning on July 1, 2020 and the rules could significantly increase the capital requirements for certain participants in the OTC derivatives market in which we participate. These increased capital requirements could result in significant additional costs being passed through to end-users like us or reduce the number of participants or products available to us in the OTC derivatives market. The effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities, or substantially increase the cost of hedging, which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nThe European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations, which could also adversely affect our hedging opportunities.\nAdverse tax law changes may affect our operations.\nIn California, there have been numerous proposals for additional income, sales, excise and property taxes, including taxes on oil and gas production. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to additional future taxes. The imposition of increased taxes could significantly reduce our profit margins and cash flow and could ultimately reduce our capital investments and growth plans.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are concentrated in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional conditions. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, transportation and storage capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. Our operations are also exposed to natural disasters and other nature-related events common to California, such as wildfires, mudslides, high winds and earthquakes. The concentration of our operations in California and limited local storage options also increase our exposure to mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties, including those affecting our operations, our supply chain and those who purchase, transport or use our products. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect our operations or results.\nConcerns about climate change and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues may materially affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services, and we may be unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues may increase our operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic, and potentially lower the value of our reserves and other assets. As these requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital. Both the EPA and California have implemented laws, regulations and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. California's cap-and-trade program operates under a market system and the costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as CARB tightens program requirements and annually increases the minimum state auction price of allowances and reduces the state's GHG emissions cap.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal and state laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels, electricity generation and other applications, prohibit future use of certain vehicles and equipment that require petroleum fuels, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy. For example, former Governor Brown issued executive orders in 2018 setting a target of at least five million \"zero-emission\" vehicles in California by 2030 and a goal for the state to be \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d by 2045. A bill has been introduced in the California Legislature that seeks to prohibit the sale or registration of new automobiles in California with internal combustion engines by 2040. Various claimants, including certain municipalities, have also filed litigation alleging that energy producers are liable for conditions the claimants attribute to climate change.\nGovernmental authorities can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations, and various state and local agencies are conducting increased regional, community and field air monitoring specifically with respect to oil and natural gas operations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in southern and central California where most of our operations are located, are in most instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations. For example, the San Joaquin Valley will be required to adopt more rigorous attainment plans under the Clean Air Act to comply with federal ozone and particulate matter standards, and these efforts could affect our activities in the region and our ability and cost to obtain permits for new or modified operations.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and production activities and our assets are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, equipment or information technology failures and industrial accidents, as are the assets and properties of third parties who supply us with energy, equipment and services or who purchase, transport or use our products. In addition, events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wildfires, high winds, droughts, cyber-security or terrorist attacks and other events may cause operations to cease or be curtailed and could adversely affect our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nInformation technology failures and cyber-security attacks could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our exploration, development and production activities. We also use these systems and networks to prepare our financial management and reporting information, to analyze and store data and to communicate internally and with third parties, including our service providers. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nCyber-security attacks on businesses have escalated and become more sophisticated in recent years and include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, malicious software, ransomware and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or the corruption of data. In addition, our vendors, customers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber-security attacks that, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. If we or the third parties with whom we interact were to experience a successful attack, the potential consequences to our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate could be significant including financial losses, loss of business, litigation risks and damage to reputation. As the sophistication of cyber-security attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our security.\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to our separation from Occidental in 2014.\nIn connection with our separation from Occidental, we entered into contracts that allocate risks and liabilities (including tax liabilities) between Occidental and ourselves. These contracts were not made on an arm\u2019s length basis and include mutual indemnity obligations. Indemnity payments that we may be required to provide Occidental may be significant and could adversely impact our business. Similarly, third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that Occidental has agreed to retain and the indemnity from Occidental may not be sufficient or paid timely.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
