{"cik": "813298", "company": "DESTINATION XL GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors are the important factors of which we are aware that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. We cannot assure you that our projected results or events will be achieved or will occur.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Industry\nThe global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and, based on the current status and uncertainty, will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial results, liquidity, supply chain and workforce until a significant portion of the U.S. population has been vaccinated.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. Federal, state and local agencies have mandated various restrictions including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, state of emergencies, stay-at-home orders and closure of all non-essential businesses, among others.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial results and liquidity until a significant portion of the U.S. population has been vaccinated and our customers begin to socialize outside the home. All of our stores were closed temporarily on March 17, 2020 and remained closed through the end of April 2020, at which point we began to open our stores on a gradual basis through June 30, 2020. During fiscal 2020, we focused on mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and preserving our liquidity. These efforts included, among other things, (i) the furloughing of substantially all of our associates while our stores remained closed, (ii) temporarily reducing, on a tiered basis, the salaries of all members of management through August 2, 2020, (iii) suspending merit increases, (iv) implementing a restructuring program in the third quarter to reduce SG&A costs by terminating services agreements, eliminating certain professional services and reduced marketing costs, (v) eliminating approximately 101 corporate positions and a total of 1,078 store associates since March 2020, (vi) suspending compensation for non-employee directors for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and reducing the size of the board from nine to six directors, (vii) eliminating capital expenditures and operating expenses, where possible, (viii) negotiating with vendors and landlords for extended and revised payment terms, (ix) cancelling approximately $148.0 million of on-order merchandise, at retail, (x) drawing $30.0 million under our credit facility and amending that facility to increase our borrowing base availability by delaying the step-down of our advance rates and amending the agreement to permit the Company the ability to enter into an aggregate of up to $15.0 million in promissory notes with merchandise vendors, and (xi) pursuing all opportunities that may be available to us under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, (\"CARES Act\").\nThese actions may not be successful in mitigating the effects of this pandemic, which remains highly uncertain and difficult to predict, especially given the existence of new variants, and the actions that we take may negatively impact or delay our strategic initiatives. For example, even though our stores are open, we cannot be assured that (i) consumer demand and, therefore, sales will return to levels experienced prior to the pandemic, (ii) if sales do not return to levels prior to the pandemic, sales will be at levels sufficient to support the ongoing business, (iii) new practices or protocols could impact our business and may continue and/or increase, for example, occupancy limitations, (iv) our stores can remain open if there is a resurgence of the virus and therefore need to close again, or (v) our associates will be willing to staff our stores, as a result of health concerns. Furthermore;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to effectively manage our operating costs on a lower sales base;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to effectively manage the availability under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to maintain or obtain favorable credit terms with our third-party vendors, making it harder to manage liquidity and receive inventory on a timely schedule;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to successfully renegotiate certain lease agreements commensurate with expected sales levels;\n\u2022\nwe cannot be assured that inventory costs will not increase or that inventory will be readily accessible from our vendors;\nand\n\u2022\nwe cannot be assured that we will not have further impairments of our long-lived assets.\nIn addition to the specific risks to our business noted above, we will also be subject to the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the U.S. economy as a whole. The U.S. experienced unprecedented unemployment and an economic recession during fiscal 2020 that has impacted consumer discretionary spending, and therefore consumer demand for our products. The magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, and while government authorities\u2019 measures relating to the pandemic may be relaxed as the pandemic abates, these measures may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of an economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future due to a continued erosion in consumer sentiment or the effect of\nunemployment on our customer base. Furthermore, our customers may have or will continue to have a decrease in in discretionary consumer spending which would have an adverse impact on our store traffic and sales.\nOur ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nThe operation of our business, the rate of our expansion and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. We will also need sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations under our existing debt agreements.\nThe amount that we are able to borrow and have outstanding under our credit facility at any given time is determined using an availability formula based on eligible assets. As a result, our ability to borrow is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as advance rates and the amount and quality of inventory, which could reduce the funds available to us under our credit facility. In addition, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, inventory levels have been reduced to align with expected decreased sales. This directly impacts our borrowing base and there can be no assurance that we can effectively manage the balance of maintaining inventory and sufficient availability, especially during peak selling periods.\nWe cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations or cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot ensure that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may not be successful in executing our strategy and growing our market share.\nFor us to be successful in the future and maintain growth, we must be able to continue increasing our share of the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market. Our growth is dependent on our ability to continue to build upon our DXL brand, maintain our existing customers and continue to attract new customers. Our failure to execute our strategy successfully could prevent us from growing our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including if we were unable to:\n\u2022\ngrow our DXL e-commerce business;\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective modern marketing program to build store and digital awareness as well as increase store and online traffic, attract customers across all channels, and grow sales;\n\u2022\npredict and respond to fashion trends, while offering our customers a broad selection of merchandise in an extended selection of sizes;\n\u2022\ngrow our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nattract and retain new customers across all channels;\n\u2022\nhire qualified store management and store associates;\n\u2022\ncontinue to grow and then sustain the number of transactions, units-per-transaction and share of wallet; and\n\u2022\noperate at appropriate operating margins.\nOur marketing programs and efforts to drive traffic and convert that traffic into an increased loyal customer base are critical to achieving market share growth within the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market and may not be successful.\nOur ability to increase our share of the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market is largely dependent on effectively marketing our merchandise to all of our target customers in several diverse market segments so that they will become loyal shoppers who spend a greater portion of their wallets on our product offerings. In order to grow our market share, we depend on the success of our marketing and advertising in a variety of ways, including television and radio advertising, advertising events, loyalty programs, catalogs, and digital marketing, including social media, e-commerce and customer prospecting. Our business is directly impacted by the success of these efforts and those of our vendors. Future marketing efforts by us, our vendors or our other licensors, may be costly and, if not successful, may negatively affect our ability to meet our sales goals and gain market share.\nOur direct business is a significant component of our growth strategy, and the failure to develop our e-commerce and internet infrastructure could disrupt our business and negatively impact our sales.\nWe continue to have increasing levels of sales made through online shopping and via mobile devices. We have made significant investments in capital spending and labor to develop these channels and invested in digital media to attract new customers. Growth of our overall sales is dependent on customers\u2019 continuing to expand their online purchases in addition to in-store purchases. During fiscal 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw significant growth in our DXL.com business with revenues increasing 38.6% from fiscal 2019. While it is our objective to continue to grow this business, there can be no assurance that this growth will continue or be sustainable.\nOur success in growing our direct business will depend in part upon our development of an increasingly sophisticated e-commerce experience and infrastructure. Increasing customer sophistication requires that we provide additional website features and functionality in order to be competitive in the marketplace and maintain market share. We continually update our website features, but we cannot predict future trends and required functionality or our adoption rate for customer preferences. In addition, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with e-commerce sales, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to respond to these risks and uncertainties successfully could reduce our direct sales, increase our costs and diminish our growth prospects, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop and implement our omni-channel initiatives successfully, our market share and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur customer\u2019s shopping behavior continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are working to meet his needs. This includes the expansion of our BOPIS (buy online pick up in stores) and BOPAC (buy online pick up curbside) during fiscal 2020 to help our customers continue to shop during the pandemic. While we consider ourselves an omni-channel retailer, we continue to make ongoing investments in our information technology systems to support evolving omni-channel capabilities.\nOmni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives.\nIf the investment in our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, our systems are unable to support such initiatives, or if our competitors are more successful, our financial results and our market penetration may be adversely affected.\nThe growth of our wholesale segment may not be successful.\nAs part of our strategic growth plan, we launched a wholesale segment in fiscal 2018 focused on product development and distribution relationships with key retailers. We are working on developing and distributing co-branded big & tall men\u2019s apparel lines. The success of this strategic initiative depends on a number of factors, including our ability to grow our wholesale customer base, develop a cost-effective infrastructure, and sustain adequate liquidity to meet the longer lead times associated with the wholesale business. In addition, because our wholesale customers order merchandise on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis, as our wholesale business grows, any decision by any customer to decrease their order volume or cease purchasing from us could adversely affect our wholesale revenues and profitability.\nThe loss of, or disruption in, our centralized distribution center could negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe majority of our merchandise for our stores and e-commerce operations is received into our centralized distribution center in Canton, Massachusetts, where it is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores or directly to our customers. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution center. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and well-positioned to support our strategic plans, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, employee matters or shipping problems, or disruptions in our distribution center, including potential closure if an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 or there is a governmentally-imposed quarantine, could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or directly to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in labor shortages, which may affect our ability to process and ship inventory in a timely manner.\nWith all of our management information systems centralized in our corporate headquarters, any disruption or destruction of our system infrastructure could materially affect our business. This type of disaster is mitigated by our offsite storage and disaster recovery plans, but we would still incur business interruption that may impact our business a significant period of time.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be sure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason or if we incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption from our distribution center.\nOur business may be adversely affected due to disruptions in the global supply chain.\nDisruptions in the global supply chain due to COVID-19 outbreaks in foreign ports and shortages of vessels and shipping containers may impact our ability to import inventory in a timely manner. The impact of COVID-19 on domestic ports has also created a similar disruption in the supply chain and may cause delays in the receipt and shipment of inventory. Furthermore, in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, we may not be able to maintain adequate inventory levels of important merchandise on a consistent basis, which would negatively impact our sales and potentially erode the confidence of our customer base, leading to further loss of sales and an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully manage our store portfolio.\nWe lease all of our store locations. Renewing and renegotiating these leases at acceptable lease terms is critical to the profitability of our stores. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we were able to negotiate short-term rent relief agreements, primarily through rent abatements and rent deferments, with the majority of our landlords due to the temporary store closures in response to the pandemic. Given the uncertainty as to the continued impact of the pandemic on store sales as well as our customers\u2019 shift to online shopping, we are continuing to engage with our landlords to restructure certain lease arrangements. If store sales do not return to levels prior to the pandemic and we are unable to renegotiate lease agreements, certain stores may not be profitable and we may not be able to renew existing agreements. At January 30, 2021, we have 131 stores that have either a natural lease expiration or a kick-out option within the next two years. This provides us an opportunity to right-size our store portfolio over the next few years, through lease renegotiations or lease-term expirations, to ensure that we are optimizing our store profitability and omni-channel distribution.\nOur business is highly competitive, and competitive factors may reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nThe United States big & tall men\u2019s apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty apparel retailers, discount stores and online retailers offering a broad range of apparel products similar to the products that we sell. Besides retail competitors, we consider any manufacturer of big & tall men\u2019s merchandise operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor. It is also possible that another competitor, either a mass merchant or a men\u2019s specialty store or specialty apparel catalog, could gain market share in big & tall men\u2019s apparel due to more favorable pricing, locations, brand and fashion assortment and size availability. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do.\nThe presence in the marketplace of various fashion trends and the limited availability of shelf space also can affect competition. We may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors in the future and could lose market share. A significant loss of market share would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, we maintain exclusivity arrangements with several of the brands that we carry. If we were to lose any of these exclusivity arrangements or brands altogether, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur business is seasonal and is affected by general economic conditions.\nOur business is seasonal. Historically, a significant portion of our operating income has been generated during our fourth quarter (November-January). If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products during our fourth quarter, our sales in that quarter could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could cause our annual operating results to suffer. In addition, our operations may be negatively affected by local, regional or national economic conditions, such as levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence. Due to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from such risks is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our fourth quarter.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of the merchandise we sell.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and are therefore entirely dependent on third parties to manufacture the merchandise we sell. Without adequate supplies of merchandise to sell to our customers in the merchandise styles and fashions demanded by our particular customer base, sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer. We are dependent on these third parties\u2019 ability to fulfill our merchandise orders and meet our delivery terms. In the event that manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner or continue to manufacture products for us, we would have to rely on other current manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new manufacturers. We might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for\nexisting or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers might not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Our inability to secure adequate and timely supplies of private label merchandise would negatively impact proper inventory levels, sales and gross margin rates, and ultimately our results of operations.\nIn addition, even if our current manufacturers continue to manufacture our products, they may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards. If we were forced to rely on manufacturers who produce products of inferior quality, then our brand and customer satisfaction would likely suffer which would negatively impact our business. These manufacturers may also increase the cost to us of the products we purchase from them. The Company publishes a Code of Conduct, which is a part of every agreement requiring compliance by the manufacturing facilities. The Company is working with its third-party audit vendor to ensure a responsible and ethical supply chain. We are and will continue to pursue our corporate responsibilities and create a positive effect on human rights as well as the environment. If, despite third-party audits, the manufacturing facilities engage in workplace or human rights violations and we are unable to identify or correct it, it may negatively affect our business and harm our brand.\nOur business may be negatively impacted and we may be liable if third parties misappropriate proprietary information of our customers and breach our security systems.\nWe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. The majority of our retail sales are settled through credit and debit card transactions. While our Board of Directors has a Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Committee to oversee the monitoring and management of cyber risk and data privacy for our Company, and we have not had any security breaches to date, any breach could expose us to risks of loss, litigation and liability and could adversely affect our operations as well as cause our shoppers to stop shopping with us as a result of their lack of confidence in the security of their personally identifiable information, which could have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. We attempt to limit exposures to security breaches and sensitive customer data through the use of \u201ctokens\u201d in connection with both in-store and online credit card transactions, which eliminates the storage of credit card numbers. Like many retailers, we have seen an increase in cyberattack attempts, predominantly through phishing and social engineering scams, and in particular, ransomware. While none of these attempts has been successful, there can be no assurance that our continued security measures will be effective or sufficient in the future. If third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate the personal information or credit card information of our customers or if third parties gain unauthorized and improper access to such information, we could be subject to liability. These liabilities could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, or claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes, and could ultimately result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could be significant.\nFurther, if a third party were to use this proprietary customer information in order to compete with us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and could result in litigation.\nWe may be unable to predict fashion trends and customer preferences successfully.\nCustomer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to predict effectively and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends to appropriate saleable product offerings. If we are unable to predict or respond to changing styles or trends successfully and misjudge the market for products or any new product lines, our sales will be impacted and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which would decrease our revenues and margins. In addition, the failure to satisfy consumer demand, specifically in our DXL stores and from our website, could have serious longer-term consequences, such as an adverse impact on our brand value and the loss of market share to our competitors.\nThe loss of any of our key trademarks or licenses could adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe own and use a number of trademarks and operate under several trademark license agreements. We believe that certain of these trademarks have significant value and are instrumental in our ability to create and sustain demand for and to market our products. We cannot be certain that these trademarks and licensing agreements will remain in effect and enforceable or that any license agreements, upon expiration, can be renewed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any future disputes concerning these trademarks and licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the disputed trademarks.\nGeneral Risks That May Affect Our Business\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.\nPeriodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Specifically, if an individual store location is unable to generate sufficient future cash flows, we may be required to record a partial or full impairment of that store\u2019s right-of-use assets and its property and equipment. In addition, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets (such as store relocations or closures) may also result in impairment charges. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business during fiscal 2020, the Company did incur significant asset impairment charges during fiscal 2020. Due to the uncertainty that remains regarding the duration of the pandemic and its impact on our store locations, we may need to take additional impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges to LIBOR may negatively impact us.\nThe London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Our current credit facility provides us an option to convert some of our prime-based borrowings into short-term LIBOR contracts.\nRegulators in the United Kingdom that oversee LIBOR have stated that they cannot guarantee LIBOR's availability beyond the end of 2021 and expects that reliance on LIBOR will be phased out through 2023. In the absence of a LIBOR rate, our credit facility provides for a comparable or successor rate to be used. It is expected that the LIBOR rate will be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. As such, while we do not expect that we will have to renegotiate our credit facility, we do not know whether it could result in increased interest costs. In the absence of a favorable LIBOR or successor rate, our borrowings bear interest based on the Federal Funds rate. At January 30, 2021, approximately $72.0 million of our total outstanding debt of $74.4 million was in short-term LIBOR-based contracts. We cannot provide assurance that future interest rate charges will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.\nOur success depends significantly on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur future success is dependent on the personal efforts, performance and abilities of our key management, which includes our executive officers as well as members of our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management may result in a loss of organizational focus, poor operating execution, an inability to identify and execute strategic initiatives, an impairment in our ability to identify new store locations, and an inability to consummate possible acquisitions. The competition is intense for the type of highly skilled individuals with relevant industry experience that we require and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain new employees of the caliber needed to achieve our objectives.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs due to new regulations could harm our business.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, during fiscal 2020 we experienced labor shortages in our distribution facility and in our stores. If such labor shortages continue, especially during peak-selling periods, it may negatively impact our ability to process inventory in a timely manner and effectively staff our stores. Furthermore, if the federal minimum wage is increased to $15 per hour, we may need to increase not only the rate of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. If we are unable to pass on these higher costs through price increases or reduced workforce hours, our margins and profitability may be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ban of Xinjiang cotton, we are starting to see cost increases in labor and across raw materials. We have secured raw materials in key item programs to reduce the impact on our gross margin. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin or on our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. The prices for fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. To the extent that we cannot offset these cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies, such higher costs will need to be passed on to our customers. Such increased costs could lead to reduced customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nFailure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations), privacy and information security regulations, unclaimed property laws, the Affordable Care Act and many others. The effect of some of these laws and regulations may be to increase the cost of doing business and may have a material impact on our earnings. In addition, the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement. In addition, as a result of operating in Canada, we must comply with their laws and regulations which may differ substantially from, and may conflict with, corresponding U.S. laws and regulations. We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, we may be subject to government enforcement action, class action litigation or other litigation, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, and increased cost of regulatory compliance, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Stock\nTrading of our common stock on the OTCQX market may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares.\nIn December 2020 we voluntarily delisted our common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market to the OTCQX tier of the OTC Markets. Our common stock is currently quoted under the symbol \u201cDXLG.\u201d Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQX may be thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. Our common stock will continue to trade on OTCQX so long as we meet their standards for continued qualifications, including having at least two brokers who choose to make a market for our common stock, however, there can be no assurances regarding any such trading.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, since January 4, 2021, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTCQX has ranged from a low of $0.26 to a high of $0.80 on January 29, 2021. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\noverall changes in the economy and general market volatility;\n\u2022\nnews announcements regarding our quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nquarterly comparable sales;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\ncompetitive developments;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation (such as increased wage and paid benefits laws);\n\u2022\nlitigation affecting us; or\n\u2022\nmarket views as to the prospects of the retail clothing industry generally.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, limits transfers of our common stock and may, along with state law, inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions that restrict any person or entity from attempting to purchase our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent stockholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent stockholder. These provisions provide that any transfer that violates such provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee, upon demand by us, to transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. These provisions would make the acquisition of our Company more expensive to\nthe acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring our Company without the approval of our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including, without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock. The provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11379, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "DXLG"}
