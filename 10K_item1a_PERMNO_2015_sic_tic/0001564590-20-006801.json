{"cik": "1669811", "company": "Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in the Annual Report. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nA significant part of the Company\u2019s business is derived from the use of DFIN\u2019s services and products in connection with financial and strategic business transactions. Trends that affect the volume of these transactions may negatively impact the demand for DFIN\u2019s services and products.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s net sales depends on the purchase of DFIN\u2019s services and products by parties involved in GCM compliance and transactions. As a result, the Company\u2019s business is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts, bankruptcy and claims processing and other transactions. These transactions are often tied to market conditions and the resulting volume of these types of transactions affects demand for the Company\u2019s services and products. Downturns in the financial markets, global economy or in the economies of the geographies in which the Company does business and reduced equity valuations create risks that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business. For example, in the past, economic volatility has led to a decline in the financial condition of a number of the Company\u2019s clients and led to the postponement of their capital markets transactions. To the extent that there is continued volatility, the Company may face increasing volume pressure. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s offerings for GIM clients can be affected by fluctuations in the inflow and outflow of money into investment management funds which determines the number of new funds that are opened and closed. As a result, the Company is unable to predict the impact of any potential worsening of macroeconomic conditions which could have impacts to the Company\u2019s results of operations. The level of activity in the financial communications services industry, including the financial transactions and related compliance needs DFIN\u2019s services and products are used to support, is sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including interest rates, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 competitive environments, business trends, terrorism and political change, such as the impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s (the \u201cUK\u201d) recent withdrawal from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d). While EU rules will continue to apply in the UK until the end of 2020 (which period may be extended by one or two years), there can be no assurance that an agreement between the UK and the EU with regard to future trade and co-operation will be reached prior to the end of this transition period. In addition, a weak economy could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts owed by clients. Failure of the Company\u2019s clients to pay the amounts owed or to pay such amounts in a timely manner, may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to credit risks and result in bad debt write-offs. Unfavorable conditions or changes in any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe quality of the Company\u2019s customer support and services offerings is important to the Company\u2019s clients, and if the Company fails to offer high quality customer support and services, clients may not use DFIN\u2019s solutions resulting in a potential decline in net sales.\nA high level of customer support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of DFIN\u2019s solutions. If the Company is unable to provide a level of customer support and service to meet or exceed clients\u2019 expectations, the Company could experience a loss of clients and market share, a failure to attract new clients, including in new geographic regions and increased service and support costs and a diversion of resources. Any of these results could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nA substantial part of the Company\u2019s business depends on clients continuing their use of DFIN\u2019s services and products. Any decline in the Company\u2019s client retention would harm the Company\u2019s future operating results.\nThe Company does not have long term contracts with most of GCM and GIM clients and, therefore, relies on their continued use of DFIN\u2019s services and products, particularly for compliance-related services. As a result, client retention, particularly during periods of declining transactional volume, is an important part of the Company\u2019s strategic business plan. There can be no assurance that clients will continue to use DFIN\u2019s services and products to meet their ongoing needs, particularly in the face of competitors\u2019 services and products offerings. Client retention rates may decline due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s inability to demonstrate to the value of its solutions;\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of DFIN\u2019s solutions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing services and products;\n\u2022\nclients\u2019 ceasing to use or anticipating a declining need for the Company\u2019s services in their operations;\n\u2022\nconsolidation in the Company\u2019s client base;\n\u2022\nthe effects of economic downturns and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnology and application failures and outages, interruption of service, security breaches or fraud which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and the Company\u2019s relations with its clients; or\n\u2022\nreductions in clients\u2019 spending levels.\nIf the Company\u2019s retention rates are lower than anticipated or decline for any reason, the Company\u2019s net sales may decrease and the Company\u2019s profitability may be harmed, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by new technologies enabling clients to produce and file documents on their own.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected as clients seek out opportunities to produce and file regulatory documentation on their own and begin to implement technologies that assist them in this process. For example, clients and their financial advisors have increasingly relied on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute reports required pursuant to the Exchange Act, prospectuses and other materials as a replacement for using the Company\u2019s EDGAR filing services. If technologies are further developed to provide clients with the ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations, and the Company does not develop products or provide services to compete with such new technologies, the Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by those clients who choose alternative solutions, including self-serving or filing themselves.\nThe Company\u2019s performance and growth depend on its ability to generate client referrals and to develop referenceable client relationships that will enhance the Company\u2019s sales and marketing efforts.\nThe Company depends on users of its solutions to generate client referrals for the Company\u2019s services. The Company depends, in part, on the financial institutions, law firms and other third parties who use DFIN\u2019s services and products to recommend solutions to their client base, which provides the Company the opportunity to reach a larger client base than it can reach through the direct sales and internal marketing efforts. For instance, a portion of the Company\u2019s net sales from GCM clients is generated through referrals by investment banks, financial advisors and law firms that have utilized the Company\u2019s services in connection with prior transactions. These referrals are an important source of new clients for the Company\u2019s services.\nA decline in the number of referrals could require the Company to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of its services, which would increase costs, potentially lead to a decline in net sales, slow the Company\u2019s growth and negatively impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $300 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024 (\u201cNotes\u201d) outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any amounts outstanding under its Credit Facilities, as defined below. The Company\u2019s ability to make payments on and to refinance indebtedness, as well as any future debt that it may incur, will depend on the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. The Company\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may not generate sufficient funds to service its debt and meet its business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company is not able to repay or refinance debt as it becomes due, it may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including facility closure, staff reductions, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, and restricting future capital return to stockholders. The lenders who hold the Company\u2019s debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event of a default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of the Company\u2019s debt.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s competitors who may be less leveraged, could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions, secure additional financing and may better withstand downturns in the Company\u2019s industry or the economy in general.\nThe agreements and instruments that govern the Company\u2019s debt impose restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility.\nOn September 30, 2016, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $350.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Facility\u201d) and a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility,\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Credit Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Agreement that governs the Company\u2019s Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThese covenants can have the effect of limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the Company\u2019s business and the markets in which it competes. In addition, the Credit Agreement that governs the Credit Facilities requires the Company to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in the Company being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in the Term Loan Credit Facility and indenture. If the Company violates covenants under the Credit Facilities and indenture and is unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders, the Company\u2019s debt under the Credit Facilities and indenture would be in default and could be accelerated by the Company\u2019s lenders. Due to cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing the Company\u2019s debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, other debt.\nIf the Company\u2019s debt is accelerated, the Company may not be able to repay its debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if the Company is able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable, or at all. If the Company\u2019s debt is in default for any reason, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause the Company to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the Notes and may make it more difficult for the Company to successfully execute its business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nDespite the Company\u2019s current level of indebtedness, it may be able to incur significantly more debt.\nDespite the Company\u2019s current level of indebtedness, the Company may be able to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities restrict the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Also, these restrictions do not prevent the Company from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had $231.6 million available for additional borrowing under the Revolving Facility. The more indebtedness the Company incurs, the further exposed it becomes to the risks associated with leverage described above.\nAdverse credit market conditions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing.\nThe Company may, from time to time, depend on access to credit markets. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial markets institutions to fail or may cause lenders to hoard capital and reduce lending. As a result, DFIN may not obtain financing on terms and conditions that are favorable, or at all.\nThe highly competitive market for DFIN\u2019s services and products and industry fragmentation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe financial communications services industry is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry and the industry remains highly fragmented in North America and internationally. Management expects that competition will increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging entrants. Additionally, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. As a result, competition may lead to additional pricing pressure on DFIN\u2019s services and products, which could negatively impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe business plan management announced at the Company\u2019s 2018 investor day relies on the Company\u2019s ability to transform into a software-as-a-service company, and a failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of clients may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, and if the Company fails to successfully develop, introduce or integrate new services or enhancements to its services and products platforms, systems or applications, DFIN\u2019s reputation, net sales and operating income may suffer.\nIn May 2018, management introduced the Company\u2019s new business plan that focuses on transitioning its business to a software and technology focused company. In order to do that, the Company must attract new clients for those businesses, and its ability to attract new clients and increase sales to existing clients will depend in large part on the Company\u2019s ability to enhance and improve existing services and products platforms, including application solutions, and to introduce new functionality either by acquisition or internal development. The Company\u2019s operating results would suffer if its innovations are not responsive to the needs of the Company\u2019s clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not brought to market effectively. In addition, it is possible that management\u2019s assumptions about the features that they believe will drive purchasing decisions for the Company\u2019s potential clients or renewal decisions for the existing clients could be inaccurate. There can be no assurance that new products or services, or upgrades to DFIN\u2019s products or services, will be released as anticipated or that, when released, they will not contain defects. If product defects arise, the Company could experience negative publicity, damage to its reputation, decline in net sales, delay in market acceptance or claims by clients brought against the Company. Moreover, upgrades and enhancements to the Company\u2019s platforms may require substantial capital investment without assurance that the upgrades and enhancements will enable the Company to achieve or sustain a competitive advantage in the product and service offerings. If the Company is unable to license or acquire new technology solutions to enhance existing product and service offerings, the results of operations, financial position and cash flow may be negatively impacted.\nUndetected errors or failures found in DFIN\u2019s services and products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of the services and products that could negatively impact its business.\nDFIN\u2019s services and products may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations during their life cycle, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released to the market. The Company releases enhanced versions of products including platforms during various stages of development. Despite production testing by the Company and operational testing by current and potential clients, errors may not be found in new services and products until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, client dissatisfaction and decline in net sales and operating income.\nModifications in the rules and regulations to which clients or potential clients are subject to may impact the demand for the Company\u2019s product and service offerings.\nClients are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications governing the form, content and delivery methods of such communications, such as SEC Rule 30e-3 which provides certain registered investment companies with an option to electronically deliver shareholder reports and other materials rather than providing such reports in paper. Modifications in these regulations may impact clients\u2019 business practices and could reduce demand for DFIN\u2019s services and products offerings. Modifications in such regulations could eliminate the need for certain types of communications altogether or impact the quantity or format of required communications.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its systems, software and solutions could seriously damage the Company\u2019s reputation and affect its ability to retain clients and attract new business.\nMaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of DFIN\u2019s systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for the Company and its clients and users who rely on DFIN\u2019s systems to prepare regulatory filings and store and exchange large volumes of information, much of which is proprietary, confidential and may constitute material nonpublic information. Given DFIN\u2019s systems contain material nonpublic information about public reporting companies and potential mergers and acquisitions activities prior to its public release, the Company may be a target of hacking or cybercrime. Inadvertent disclosure of the information maintained on DFIN\u2019s systems (or on the systems of the vendors on which the Company relies) due to human error, breach of the systems through hacking, cybercrime or a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct, could seriously damage the Company\u2019s reputation, could cause it to expend significant resources responding to document requests from government agencies and customers and could cause significant reputational harm for the Company and its clients. The Company\u2019s technologies, systems, networks and software have been and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attacks, which range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at the Company. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and the Company has in the past and may in the future be subject to security breaches. For example, during 2019 the Company experienced two cyber incidents, one of which was through a commercial partner. The incident involving the Company\u2019s commercial partner was a result of a compromise to the partner\u2019s email server and the DFIN incident was, the Company believes, the result of a compromised login credential, each of which allowed unauthorized viewing of client information on that system. In each incident, the Company believes the unauthorized access was limited to that system. The Company has contacted, and, in the future will contact, impacted customers as appropriate with respect to all cyber incidents.\nThe Company\u2019s customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate login credentials, including passwords, or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to its information systems, the information systems of its vendors or third-party service providers and/or its customers' computers. Though the Company endeavors to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyber attacks against the Company or its vendors and third-party service providers remain a serious issue. Further, to access the Company\u2019s services and products, the Company\u2019s customers use personal electronic devices that are beyond DFIN\u2019s security control systems. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until executed against a target. Consistent with all software solutions, DFIN\u2019s software may be vulnerable to these types of attacks. Breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm. An attack of this type could disrupt the proper functioning of the Company\u2019s software solutions, cause errors in the output of clients\u2019 work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information and other undesirable or destructive outcomes.\nAs a result of these types of risks and attacks, the Company has implemented and continuously reviews and updates systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. For example, in 2019 the Company refreshed relevant security standards to reflect changes in current security threats, increased the number of cyber security resources monitoring DFIN systems for cyber threats, enhanced intrusion and detection capabilities and refreshed mandatory information security awareness training content, including awareness around phishing. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt their respective systems and processes and overall security environment. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.\nFurthermore, DFIN\u2019s systems allow the Company to share information that may be confidential in nature to its clients across the Company\u2019s offices worldwide. This design allows the Company to increase global reach for its clients and increase its responsiveness to client demands, but also increases the risk of a security breach or a leak of such information as it allows additional points of access to information by increasing the number of employees and facilities working on certain jobs. In addition, DFIN\u2019s systems leverage third party outsourcing arrangements, which expedites the Company\u2019s responsiveness but exposes information to additional access points. If an actual or perceived information leak or breach of security were to occur, the Company\u2019s reputation could suffer, clients could stop using DFIN\u2019s services and products offerings, the Company could have to respond to document requests from government agencies and customers and it could face lawsuits and potential liability, any of which could cause DFIN\u2019s financial performance to be negatively impacted. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, expenses to prevent, investigate and remediate security breaches and vulnerabilities, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. Though the Company maintains professional liability insurance that includes coverage if a cybersecurity incident were to occur, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available, responsive, or that the available coverage will be sufficient to cover losses and claims related to any cybersecurity incidents the Company may experience.\nA number of core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, client service and financial transactions, rely on DFIN\u2019s IT infrastructure and applications. Defects or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s IT infrastructure and applications could cause DFIN\u2019s services and products offerings not to perform as clients expect, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation and business. In addition, malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types described above could cause an outage in DFIN\u2019s infrastructure, which could lead to a substantial delay of service and ultimately downtimes, recovery costs and client claims, any of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nSome of DFIN\u2019s systems and services are developed by third parties or supported by third party hardware and software. The Company\u2019s business and reputation could suffer if these third party systems and services fail to perform properly or are no longer available to the Company.\nSome of DFIN\u2019s systems and services are developed by third parties or rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties. These systems and services, or the hardware and software required to run the Company\u2019s existing systems and services, may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of DFIN\u2019s services, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business until equivalent technology is either developed by the Company or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. In addition, it is possible that the Company\u2019s hardware vendors or the licensors of third party software could increase their prices, which could have an adverse impact on DFIN\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Further, changing hardware vendors or software licensors could detract from management\u2019s ability to focus on the ongoing operations of the Company\u2019s business or could cause delays in the operations of the business.\nAdditionally, third party software underlying DFIN\u2019s services can contain undetected errors or bugs, or be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches described above. The Company may be forced to delay commercial release of its services until any discovered problems are corrected and, in some cases, may need to implement enhancements or modifications to correct errors that the Company does not detect until after deployment of its services.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact DFIN\u2019s software products and expose the Company to increased liability.\nPrivacy and data security laws apply to DFIN\u2019s various businesses in all jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In particular, clients use DFIN\u2019s software services, including Venue, to share personal data and information on a confidential basis, and such sharing may be subject to privacy and data security laws. DFIN\u2019s global business operates in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States. These data protection laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. New laws, such as the GDPR which went into effect in May 2018 in Europe, and industry self-regulatory codes have been or are being enacted to protect personal data. Complying with these regulations has been, and will continue to be, costly, and there are or will be significant penalties for failure to comply with these regulations, including significant penalties for failing to comply with GDPR. Further, any perception of DFIN\u2019s practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject the Company to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt DFIN\u2019s business and expose the Company to liability.\nTransferring personal data and information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, Europe has stringent regulations regarding transfer of personal data and information. The mechanisms that DFIN and many other companies rely upon for data transfers from Europe to the United States (e.g., Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are being contested in the European court systems. The Company is closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data and information. These requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required to provide DFIN\u2019s services in the EU or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including Australia and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. These developments in Europe and elsewhere could harm DFIN\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in the costs and availability of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials may adversely impact the Company.\nIncreases in the costs of these inputs may increase DFIN\u2019s costs and the Company may not be able to pass these costs on to clients through higher prices. Moreover, rising raw materials costs, and any consequent impact on pricing, could lead to a decrease in demand for DFIN\u2019s services and products.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its proprietary technology and other rights, the value of DFIN\u2019s business and its competitive position may be impaired.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property, the Company\u2019s competitors could use its intellectual property to market services and products similar to DFIN\u2019s, which could decrease demand for its services. The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, licensing and other proprietary rights laws, as well as third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures, to protect its intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate to prevent competitors from copying or reverse-engineering DFIN\u2019s technology and services to create similar offerings. Additionally, any of DFIN\u2019s pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of protection the Company seeks, if at all. The scope of patent protection, if any, the Company may obtain is difficult to predict and the patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or of insufficient scope to prevent competitors from offering similar services. DFIN\u2019s competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company\u2019s technology. To protect DFIN\u2019s proprietary information, the Company requires employees, consultants, advisors, independent contractors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and maintain policies and procedures to limit access to the Company\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary information. These agreements and the other actions may not provide meaningful protection for DFIN\u2019s proprietary information or know-how from unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Further, existing patent laws may not provide adequate or meaningful protection in the event competitors independently develop technology, products or services similar to DFIN\u2019s. Even if the laws governing intellectual property rights provide protection, the Company may have insufficient resources to take the legal actions necessary to protect its interests. In addition, DFIN\u2019s intellectual property rights and interests may not be afforded the same protection under the laws of foreign countries as they are under the laws of the United States.\nDFIN\u2019s business is dependent upon brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance the Company\u2019s brand or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on its business.\nDFIN\u2019s brand recognition and reputation are important aspects of the Company\u2019s business. Maintaining and further enhancing DFIN\u2019s brands and reputation will be important to retaining and attracting clients for DFIN\u2019s products. The Company also believes that the importance of DFIN\u2019s brand recognition and reputation for products will continue to increase as competition in the market for DFIN\u2019s products and industry continues to increase. The Company\u2019s success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the efficacy of the Company\u2019s marketing efforts, its ability to retain existing and obtain new clients and strategic partners, human error, the quality and perceived value of DFIN\u2019s services and products offerings, actions of the Company\u2019s competitors and positive or negative publicity. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for DFIN\u2019s services and products offerings and negatively impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe Company may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management.\nDFIN\u2019s success depends, in part, on its general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain additional skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on DFIN\u2019s business. Management believes the Company\u2019s ability to retain its client base and to attract new clients is directly related to DFIN\u2019s sales force and client service personnel, and if the Company cannot retain these key employees, its business could suffer. In addition, many members of DFIN\u2019s management have significant industry experience that is valuable to competitors. The Company expects that its executive officers will have non-solicitation agreements contractually prohibiting them from soliciting clients and employees within a specified period of time after they leave DFIN. If one or more members of the senior management team leave and cannot be replaced with a suitable candidate quickly, the Company could experience difficulty in managing its business properly, which could negatively impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to employees and retirees may continue.\nDFIN provides health care and other benefits to both employees and retirees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, the cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. and internationally may also increase cost of providing such benefits.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, or lower returns on assets may increase required pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of DFIN\u2019s pension and other post-retirement benefits plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with historically low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions may increase the level of expected required pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions in future years. Various conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate, or worsen, the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, the Company\u2019s costs and required cash contributions associated with pension and other post-retirement benefit plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nThe Company is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which it does business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of non-U.S. activities, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into DFIN\u2019s financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, net sales and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that its efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses.\nThere are risks associated with operations outside the United States.\nThe Company has operations outside the United States. DFIN works with capital markets clients around the world, and in 2019 the International segment accounted for 13% of DFIN\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s operations outside of the United States are primarily focused in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of customizing services and products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\nincreased infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting and information technology;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npotentially greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, including currency conversion and cash repatriation from foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nincreased licenses, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nincreased burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including employment-related laws, which may be more stringent than U.S. laws;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable anti-corruption and sanction laws and regulations.\nThe Company cannot be sure that its investments or operations in other countries will produce desired levels of net sales or that one or more of the factors listed above will not affect the Company\u2019s global business.\nThe Company has in the past acquired and may in the future to acquire other businesses, and it may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon DFIN\u2019s ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and the Company may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the Company or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt the businesses of the Company or the acquired businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on strategic partnerships as part of its business strategy may adversely affect the development of DFIN\u2019s business in those areas.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes pursuing and maintaining strategic partnerships in order to facilitate its entry into adjacent lines of business. This approach may expose the Company to risk of conflict with its strategic arrangement partners and the need to divert management resources to oversee these partnership arrangements. Further, as these arrangements require cooperation with third party partners, these strategic arrangements may not be able to make decisions as quickly as DFIN would if it was operating on its own or may take actions that are different from what the Company would do on a standalone basis in light of the need to consider DFIN partners\u2019 interests. As a result, the Company may be less able to respond timely to changes in market dynamics, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16277, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DFIN"}
