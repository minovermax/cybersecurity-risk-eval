Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Related to our NobelClad Segment\nNobelClad operates a cyclical business and its sales are down significantly from its 2008 peak.\nNobelClad operates a somewhat cyclical business. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad\u2019s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. Higher metal prices make it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. Year-end backlog was $36.9 million, $41.2 million, and $41.8 million, respectively, in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nThe explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. If demand from such industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our revenue and margins are also affected by the price of the base metals we use; lower prices generally lead to lower revenue and often lower margins.\nOur backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.\nWe define \u201cbacklog\u201d at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. The percentage increase or decrease in NobelClad's annual sales may be substantially greater or less than the change in backlog at the previous year-end.\nThere is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.\nOur cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France. These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives. There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities. The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer. See \u201cOur use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites or DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities\u201d under \"Risk Factors Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation\" below.\nCertain raw materials NobelClad uses are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions.\nThe markets for certain metals and other raw materials used by NobelClad are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices. While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices. We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers. We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects.\nRisk Factors Related to DynaEnergetics\nPrices and pricing trends of oil and natural gas affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of DynaEnergetics\u2019 customers. The steep decline in oil and gas prices since the middle of 2014 has\nadversely affected DynaEnergetics\u2019 sales and economic performance.\nThe oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Demand for DynaEnergetics\u2019 products is linked to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies and oilfield services companies. With the worldwide decrease in oil prices and the increased supply levels of these resources, drilling for new wells has decreased sharply. For example, rig count in the United States and Canada at the end of 2015 is down approximately 68% from the highest level during 2014. DynaEnergetics\u2019 revenues in 2015 were 27.0% less than in 2014. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or expectations about lower future prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity, which negatively impacts DynaEnergetics\u2019 sale of products and economic performance.\nThe adoption of any future laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could cause a decrease in natural gas and oil well perforating and could materially adversely affect DynaEnergetics\u2019 sales and economic performance.\nDynaEnergetic\u2019s perforating products are used for oil and gas well hydraulic fracturing processes, among other uses. Various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken, which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of these or other laws or implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to use hydraulic fracking for natural gas and oil well development, which would reduce the demand for some of DynaEnergetic\u2019s products and could have a material adverse effect on its sales and financial performance.\nDynaEnergetics\u2019 continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry.\nDynaEnergetics\u2019 position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field. The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel. DynaEnergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field.\nDynaEnergetics\u2019 growth and market position relies on the development of demand for its innovative new technologies and products.\nDynaEnergetics is developing new and innovative products, including its DynaStage factory assembled perforating system, which it believes will drive sales at improved margins and improve its position as a technology-focused leader in the perforating market. To the extent the market for DynaStage and other new technologies and products does not develop from its existing and target customers as expected, DynaEnergetic\u2019s growth and market position may be diminished and may have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nThe manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws.\nDynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties. DynaEnergetics\u2019 continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues. While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.\nRisk Factors Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation\nOur use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites and DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities.\nWe use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals and manufacturing of perforating shaped charges and detonating cord. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the shooting site or manufacturing facility were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is\nundertaken or repairs are made. Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products. In addition, if a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations.\nWeakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations.\nNobelClad supplies products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries. Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our NobelClad products. Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DynaEnergetics products. The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations.\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of significant orders by customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions. The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results.\nWe typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries.\nMany of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency such as the Russian Ruble. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 23%, 32%, and 36% of total sales for the years ended 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DynaEnergetics KG\u2019s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $27.5 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging and pledging or disposition of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios\non a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.\nAny failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales.\nA significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn past years, the majority of NobelClad\u2019s revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDynaEnergetics has customers throughout the world. Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DynaEnergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia and other oil-producing countries with unsettled economic or political situations, could have a material adverse effect on DynaEnergetics\u2019 business and operating results.\nCustomers have the right to change orders until products are completed.\nCustomers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad and perforating companies.\nOur explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China and in South Korea that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets. There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.\nExplosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another. Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers.\nDynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products. DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value. There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction R\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Industrie, de la Recherche et de l\u2019Environnement) and the Pr\u00e9fecture des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Orientales. In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a mountain plan (\u201cBergplan\u201d), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years.\nChanges in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessor\u2019s past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives. Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations. We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.\nWe are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under \u201cLiabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal\nliabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability\u201d and \u201cThe use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\u201d\nThe export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations. These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries. In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a total of 11 days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations. The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Besides the previously mentioned work stoppage at our France facility, we have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any other location in the last three years. However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future.\nThe unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results.\nWe continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition. If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the restatement of previously-issued financial statements. The material weakness could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and in early 2015 restated our previously-issued financial statements included in our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K. These material weaknesses and the resulting restatement may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures. Although we have been working since early 2015 to remedy the ineffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk of additional material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which may also reduce investor confidence in the Company. For more information relating to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (and disclosure controls and procedures) and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d", "PERMNO": 33823, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "BOOM"}
