{"cik": "863894", "company": "VERU INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to the Regulation and Commercialization of Our Products and Drug Candidates\n\ufeff\nWe have no experience in obtaining regulatory approval for a drug.\n\ufeff\nAlthough our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Scientific Officer have experience in obtaining regulatory approval for a drug under development, the Company has never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that our applications are insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure. Any delay or inability in obtaining regulatory approvals would delay or prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates, generating revenue from these proposed products and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA we submit. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our planned NDAs for one or more of our drug candidates, which would materially adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for any of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe could experience delays in our planned clinical trials.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials that will be required to be conducted for our drug candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might need to be redesigned; might not enroll a sufficient number of patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the FDA, a DSMB, a clinical trial site's IRB or us;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u00b7\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredients; or\n\u00b7\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB for a trial.\n\ufeff\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue as to the affected drug candidate.\n\ufeff\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or discontinued.\n\ufeff\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our zuclomiphene citrate, VERU-111 and VERU-100 drug candidates, we may be required to complete preclinical development with respect to such drug candidates and/or extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates. To date, regulatory approval has not been obtained for any of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nUnfavorable results from preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated. In addition, we may report top-line data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data. Such top-line data may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the applicable clinical trial. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to our zuclomiphene citrate, VERU-111 or VERU-100 drug candidates, or any other potential future drug candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that drug candidate. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to any of our zuclomiphene citrate, VERU-111 or VERU-100 drug candidates, or any other potential future drug candidate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any proposed product that we develop, the commercial prospects of such proposed product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these proposed products will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be subject to risks relating to collaboration with third parties.\n\ufeff\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into collaboration arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize our drug candidates. For our collaboration efforts to be successful, we must identify partners whose competencies complement our competencies. We may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements. Also, we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources and capabilities of these collaborators with our own. In addition, we may face a disadvantage in seeking to enter into or negotiating collaborations with potential partners because other potential collaborators may have greater management and financial resources than we do. Our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than originally expected. If we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts, our ability to develop and market drug candidates could be severely limited.\n\ufeff\nWe intend to rely on CROs to conduct our research and development activities.\n\ufeff\nWe will not have the resources to independently conduct research and development activities. Therefore, we intend to rely on CROs to conduct research and development activities for our drug candidates and for the execution of our clinical studies. Although we will control only certain aspects of our CROs' activities, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We cannot be sure that the CROs will conduct the research properly in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis, or that the results will be reproducible. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA's cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our drug products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or invalid and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our drug candidates. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness compared to placebo of our drug candidates to a statistically significant degree, our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we will not employ the personnel of our CROs, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such organizations, we cannot control whether or not they will devote sufficient time and resources to our research and development and our clinical studies. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including one or more of our competitors, for which they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised because of the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates that we seeks to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue from such drug candidates could be delayed or ended.\n\ufeff\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and can increase our costs significantly. We may encounter challenges or delays in entering into or maintaining these relationships, and any such delays or challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe expect to rely on third party manufacturers for our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of any future drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. These drug candidates are complicated and expensive to manufacture. If our future third-party manufacturers fail to deliver our drug candidates for clinical use on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our drug candidates. While we may be able to identify replacement third-party manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for these drug candidates, this process would likely cause a delay in the availability of our drug candidates and an increase in costs. In addition, third-party manufacturers may have a limited number of facilities in which our drug candidates can be produced, and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, regulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our drug candidates. Third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA's cGMPs. As a result, the facilities used by any of future manufacturers of our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA. Holders of NDAs, or other forms of FDA approvals or clearances, or those distributing a regulated product under their own name, are responsible for manufacturing even though that manufacturing is conducted by a third-party contract manufacturing organization (CMO). Our third-party manufacturers will be required to produce our drug candidates under FDA cGMPs in order to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials. Our third-party manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to gain approval for or commercialize our drug candidates. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMPs could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, recalls, withdrawals, issuance of safety alerts and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we also could experience manufacturing delays if our CMOs give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us.\n\ufeff\nIf any supplier for our drug candidates experiences any significant difficulties in its manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our drug candidates, which could impair our ability to supply our drug candidates at the levels required for our clinical trials and commercialization and prevent or delay their successful development and commercialization.\n\ufeff\nChanges in law could have a negative impact on the approval of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials for our drug candidates. In addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. The political environment in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, specific proposals that have been discussed or implemented which could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, potential changes to the ACA, recently issued regulations offering employers religious and moral exemptions from the ACA\u2019s requirement to provide insurance covering birth control, and the enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may fail or elect not to commercialize our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot be sure that, if our clinical trials for any of our zuclomiphene citrate, VERU-111 and VERU-100 drug candidates are successfully completed, we will be able to submit an NDA to the FDA or that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all, or that the submission of any NDA is commercially feasible. We also cannot be sure that, if bioequivalence studies for Tamsulosin XR capsules or the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination are successfully completed, any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all. After completing clinical trials for a drug candidate in humans, a drug dossier is prepared and submitted to the FDA as an NDA, and includes all preclinical studies and clinical trial data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the product at the suggested dose and duration of use for the proposed indication as well as manufacturing information, in order to allow the FDA to review such drug dossier and to consider a drug candidate for approval for commercialization in the United States. If we are unable to submit an NDA with respect to any of our current drug candidates, if any NDA we submit is not approved by the FDA, or we elect not to file an NDA, we will be unable to commercialize that product. The FDA can and does reject NDAs and require additional clinical trials, even when drug candidates achieve favorable results in Phase 3 clinical trials. If we fail to commercialize any of these drug candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation, including healthcare reform measures that may negatively impact sales of FC2.\n\ufeff\nOur products, including FC2, PREBOOST\u00ae, and our drug candidates, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under various regulatory provisions. The FTC also regulates the advertising, marketing, and promotion of the Company\u2019s products. Any of our products that are tested or marketed abroad are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\n\ufeff\nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to the entirety and certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to essentially repeal and replace certain aspects of the ACA through regulatory action, and we expect such challenges to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA, while Congress has considered legislation that would repeal and replace all or part of the ACA and bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. In addition, on December 14, 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and any other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA or any of the 20+ states providing reimbursement for FC2 will impact sales. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held oral arguments in the Texas case on July 9, 2019, and a decision is expected at any time.\n\ufeff\nSpecific to the contraception coverage mandate, ACA regulations provide exemptions from this requirement for qualifying religious employers and individuals and non-governmental entities that object to providing the coverage on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs. The Trump administration issued interim final regulations in October 2017 expanding the exemptions to those entities objecting to the requirement on the basis of moral convictions, which were finalized in November 2018. Federal court judges in Pennsylvania and California separately blocked enforcements of these exemption regulations, with appellate courts upholding the decisions. Nevertheless, challenges or future regulatory efforts to erode the contraception mandate may persist and, if successful, may adversely impact sales of FC2 in states that do not separately provide for reimbursement of FC2.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGovernment regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing and selling products. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in, by way of example, significant fines, criminal and civil liability, product seizures, recalls or withdrawals, withdrawals of approvals, and exclusion and debarment from government programs. Any of these actions, including the inability of our products to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under government health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act that prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.\n\ufeff\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of health care reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\n\ufeff\nWe could experience misconduct by our employees.\n\ufeff\nWe will be exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to comply with anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products.\n\ufeff\nMarket acceptance and sales for our drug candidates, if approved, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our drug candidates, if approved. We also cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to gain and retain market acceptance for our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nPhysicians may not prescribe our drug candidates, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, which would prevent any such drug candidate from generating revenue. Market acceptance of our drug candidates, by physicians, patients and payors, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which our drug candidates are approved, if at all;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the symptoms for which they are intended;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product's FDA or other applicable regulatory agency\u2019s approved labeling; and\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\n\ufeff\nEven if the medical community accepts that our drug candidates are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt such products as an accepted treatment for the symptoms for which they are intended. We cannot be sure that any labeling approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agency will permit us to promote our products as being superior to competing products. If our drug candidates, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, even if our drug candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nnew products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen complications arise with respect to use of our products; or\n\u00b7\nsufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement does not remain available.\n\ufeff\nOur drug products may be subject to governmental pricing controls.\n\ufeff\nIn many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our likelihood of launching a product and on the profitability of any marketed product.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThird parties may obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity to our detriment.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our drug candidates and any other drug candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has expired, FDA marketing exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. Marketing exclusivity can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. Potentially competitive products may also seek marketing exclusivity and may be in various stages of development, including some more advanced than our drug candidates. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with marketing exclusivity before we do, which could delay our ability to submit a marketing application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our drug candidates and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\n\ufeff\nWe have incurred net losses in recent fiscal years and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n\ufeff\nWe incurred a net loss of $12.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2019, a net loss of $23.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2018 and a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2017. Pharmaceutical product development is a speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk and is a capital-intensive business. We expect to incur significant expenses until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and subsequently sell one or more of our drug candidates under development in significant quantities, which may not happen. We expect to devote most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. Our drug candidates will require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they can provide us with any revenue. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.\n\ufeff\nAdditional financing will be needed to support our development activities.\n\ufeff\nWe expect to incur significant expenditures over the next several years to support our preclinical and clinical development activities, particularly with respect to clinical trials for certain of our drug candidates and to commence the commercialization of our drug candidates. This will require us to obtain additional financing for our business as revenues from our current commercial operations will not independently fund our drug development programs. We may also need to obtain additional financing to complete the development of any additional drug candidates we might acquire or to pay other operating expenses.\n\ufeff\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our shareholders' ownership will be diluted. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\n\ufeff\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe size, complexity, results and timing of our development programs and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain sufficient supply of the compounds necessary for our drug candidates at a reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements we may establish;\n\u00b7\ncash requirements of any future acquisitions or the development of other drug candidates;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nour receipt of funds from other potential sources, including cash flow from licenses and sales, and payments on outstanding receivables;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in manufacturing and commercializing our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of sales or other revenues from drug candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such drug candidates and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nregulatory changes;\n\u00b7\nchanges to federal, state or local health care or prescription drug programs;\n\u00b7\nmarket and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\ncompeting technological and market developments.\n\ufeff\nThese factors could result in variations from currently projected operating and liquidity requirements.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to obtain additional capital, we may need to reduce the scope of our development programs or we could be forced to share our rights to technologies with third parties on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n\ufeff\nWe need large amounts of capital to support our development and commercialization efforts for our drug candidates. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operations, we will not be able to continue these efforts and we might have to enter into strategic collaborations that could require us to share commercial rights to one or more of our drug candidates with third parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may also need to raise additional funds if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our current business plan. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms and not enter into strategic collaborations, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nOur FC2 business may be affected by contracting risks with government and other international health agencies.\n\ufeff\nOur customers for FC2 have primarily been large international agencies and government health agencies which purchase and distribute FC2 for use in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Sales to such agencies may be subject to government contracting risks, including the appropriations process and funding priorities, potential bureaucratic delays in awarding contracts under governmental tenders, process errors, politics or other pressures, and the risk that contracts may be subject to cancellation, delay, or restructuring. A governmental tender award indicates acceptance of the bidder\u2019s price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be \u201cup to\u201d the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. As a result, government agencies may order and purchase fewer units than the full maximum tender amount and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments under government tenders. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors, including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections, and changes in demand. These contracting risks may cause significant quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results and could adversely affect our net revenues and profitability. Budget issues, spending cuts, and global health spending priorities affecting government health agencies may also adversely affect demand for FC2 and our net revenues.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms as Class II medical devices, which may result in increased competition for FC2 in the U.S. market.\n\ufeff\nOn September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them \u201csingle-use internal condoms\u201d and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various \u201cspecial controls.\u201d Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against infection transmission, and product tolerability. While FC2 is the only currently available female condom approved for marketing by the FDA in the U.S., this reclassification by the FDA may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience intense competition.\n\ufeff\nWe are engaged in the marketing and development of products in industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, that are highly competitive. The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by extensive research and rapid technological progress. Potential competitors with respect to our drug candidates in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could have a negative effect on our net revenues and profit margins.\n\ufeff\nOther parties have developed and marketed female condoms, although only two such products presently have WHO pre-clearance and none of these female condoms have been approved for market by the FDA. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S., and WHO pre-clearance is required to sell female condoms to U.N. agencies. The FDA\u2019s recent reclassification of female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification. We have experienced increasing competition in the global public health sector, and competitors received part of the last three South African tenders and the latest Brazilian tender. Increasing competition in FC2\u2019s markets has put pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affected sales of FC2, and some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, may prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. It is also possible that other companies will develop a female condom, and such companies could have greater financial resources and customer contacts than us. In addition, other contraceptive methods may compete with FC2 for funding and attention in the global public health sector.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to grow sales of FC2 in the U.S. market.\n\ufeff\nWhile the global public health sector has been the main market for FC2, we have recently implemented a strategy to grow sales for FC2 in the U.S. market, focusing on prescription sales because FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the ACA. As part of this growth strategy, we have developed relationships with distributors and telemedicine providers in the U.S. It is difficult to predict the degree of market acceptance and consumer demand we may achieve for FC2 in the U.S., and we may ultimately not be able to achieve or sustain significant sales growth in the U.S. market. Our prescription sales in the U.S. may also be adversely affected by regulations offering employers religious and moral exemptions from the ACA\u2019s requirement to provide insurance covering birth control. In addition, while we experienced fast growth in prescription sales of FC2 in fiscal 2019 largely through our agreement with a leading telemedicine provider, we may not be able to achieve sales growth with other telemedicine providers, which could cause us to be dependent on this leading telemedicine provider and could limit our growth in this market. Any failure to achieve and sustain sales growth for FC2 in the U.S. market may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may not be able to sustain price levels for sales of FC2 in the U.S. market.\n\ufeff\nPrice levels for sales of FC2 in a developed country such as the U.S. are typically higher than for sales to less developed countries in the global public health sector. Over time, due to increased competition or other factors, we may experience price erosion in the U.S. market. Negative pressure on our price levels for U.S. sales may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and gross margin in the U.S. market.\n\ufeff\nAn inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect our future growth.\n\ufeff\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of new products, technologies, and/or businesses that enable us to leverage our competitive strengths. While we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions where required, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could limit our future growth.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nThe integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may experience losses that could adversely affect our profitability;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses;\n\u00b7\npossible failure to accomplish the strategic objectives for an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in achieving planned cost-savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may require significant expenditures for product development or regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may lack adequate internal controls or have other issues with its financial systems;\n\u00b7\nthere may be regulatory compliance or other issues relating to the business practices of an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges and we may also incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, we may borrow funds or issue equity to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions could adversely affect our operating margins and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Equity issuances may dilute our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on three major customers for a significant portion of our net revenues.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's three largest customers in fiscal 2019 accounted for 64% of the Company\u2019s net revenues, with one customer accounting for 36% of the Company\u2019s net revenues. An adverse change in our relationship with our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability. In addition, we may have a concentration of accounts receivable with one or more of our largest customers, and a delay in payment by a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSince we sell FC2 in foreign markets, we are subject to international business risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\neconomic and political instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in international regulatory requirements, import duties, or export restrictions, including limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u00b7\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u00b7\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, including GDPR, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, immigration laws, labor laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u00b7\ncomplications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws and greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, distributors or other agents to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the FCPA and other anti-bribery or corruption laws, and trade regulations;\n\u00b7\nprice controls and other restrictions on foreign currency; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\n\ufeff\nAny of these risks might disrupt the supply of our products, increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues. The cost of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws increases our expenses, and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.\n\ufeff\nDisruptions from an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d At this time, the exact timing of Brexit and the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union after Brexit takes effect are uncertain. We have operations and government oversight in the United Kingdom relating to our FC2 business and a modest amount of sales of FC2 in the European Union. It is possible that changes made as a result of Brexit could subject us to heightened risks in that region, including disruptions to trade, changes in regulatory oversight, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty. Such changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and other costs used to manufacture FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience increased costs of raw materials, including the nitrile polymer used in FC2, and increased labor costs. We may not be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with manufacturing FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\n\ufeff\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses.\n\ufeff\nBecause we manufacture FC2 in a leased facility located in Malaysia, a portion of our operating costs are denominated in a foreign currency. While a material portion of our future sales of FC2 are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales of FC2 are denominated in U.S. dollars. Manufacturing costs are subject to normal currency risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) relative to the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency risk.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on a single facility to manufacture FC2, which subjects us to the risk of supply disruptions.\n\ufeff\nWe manufacture FC2 in a single leased facility located in Malaysia. Difficulties encountered by this facility, such as fire, accident, natural disaster, labor disruptions, or an outbreak of a contagious disease could halt or disrupt production at the facility, delay the completion of orders, or cause the cancellation of orders. Any of these risks could increase our expenses or reduce our net revenues.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\n\ufeff\nIf general economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate decline, or if consumers fear that economic conditions will decline, consumers may reduce expenditures for products such as our existing and potential products. Adverse changes may occur as a result of adverse global or regional economic conditions, fluctuating oil prices, declining consumer confidence, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our existing or development of future products, increase the cost, and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with producing and distributing our products and potential drug candidates. In addition, a substantial portion of the sales of FC2 are made in the public market to government agencies, including USAID and other government agencies around the world. Worsening economic conditions as well as budget deficits and austerity measures may cause pressures on government budgets and result in a reduction in quantities or prices for purchases of FC2 by governmental agencies.\n\ufeff\nSales of FC2 fluctuate, which causes our operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Sales of FC2 fluctuate based upon demand from our commercial partners and the public sector and the nature of government procurement processes. Historically, our net revenues and profitability have varied from quarter-to-quarter due to such buying patterns. Quarterly variations in operating results may cause us to fail to meet market expectations for our operating results and may tend to depress our stock price during such quarters.\n\ufeff\nMaterial adverse or unforeseen legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements could have an adverse impact on our profits and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, become a party to legal proceedings incidental to our business, including, but not limited to, alleged claims relating to product liability, environmental compliance, patent infringement, commercial disputes, securities laws, antitrust and competition laws, regulatory or administrative actions, corporate matters and employment matters. The current and future use of our drug candidates by us and potential collaborators in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to product liability claims. We will face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our drug candidates, and will face an even greater risk if we obtain FDA approval and commercialize our drug candidates in the U.S. or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of proposed new products or commercialize any additional products. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our existing products or drug candidates, if approved. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in any of the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty recruiting subjects for clinical trials or withdrawal of these subjects before a trial is completed;\n\u00b7\nlabeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls or withdrawals;\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products or products that we may develop in the future;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ninjury to reputation;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the value of our shares.\n\ufeff\nLitigation could require us to record reserves or make payments which could adversely affect our profits and cash flows. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs, may divert management's attention and resources away from our business, may prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and may substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future products and impair the ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our strategic alliance partners.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe currently maintain limited general commercial liability insurance coverage. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for liabilities in excess of our insurance limits, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\n\ufeff\nOur business and operations would suffer if we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches.\n\ufeff\nOur information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our data, as well as the data of our business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\n\ufeff\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners, participants in our clinical trials or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials as a result of a data security incident or other systems failure could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make additional investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability. As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act.\n\ufeff\nAny failure to comply with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\n\ufeff\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the importance of the global public health sector for sales of FC2, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nWe will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.\n\ufeff\nOur management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support our business plan and future growth. We will need to further expand our scientific, sales and marketing, managerial, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development and commercialization activities.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur need to manage our operations, growth and various projects effectively requires that we:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nimprove our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u00b7\nattract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees;\n\u00b7\nmanage our commercialization activities for our drug candidates effectively and in a cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7\nmanage our relationship with our partners related to the commercialization of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nmanage our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7\nmanage our internal manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner while increasing production capabilities for our current drug candidates to commercial levels; and\n\u00b7\nmanage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to partners and other third parties.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, historically, we have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants to perform a number of tasks for us, including tasks related to preclinical and clinical testing. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our use of consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. Because we rely on consultants for certain functions of our business, we will need to be able to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside consultants, as needed, on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our use of consultants, we might be unable to implement successfully the tasks necessary to execute effectively on our planned research, development and commercialization activities and, accordingly, might not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\n\ufeff\nOur credit agreement contains debt covenants which restrict our current and future operations, including our ability to take certain actions.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with SWK Funding, LLC for a synthetic royalty financing transaction. This credit agreement contains provisions that place limitations on a number of our activities, including our ability to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens on our assets or make guarantees;\n\u00b7\nmake certain acquisitions;\n\u00b7\npay dividends;\n\u00b7\nbuy back shares of our common stock; or\n\u00b7\ndispose of our assets outside the ordinary course of business or enter into a merger or similar transaction.\n\ufeff\nOur credit agreement also contains a number of financial covenants. The restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could result in a default under our credit agreement. If a default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding obligations (including a return premium) to be immediately due and payable and to exercise any other rights they have under the credit agreement or applicable law.\n\ufeff\nUntil its maturity on March 5, 2025, we are required to make quarterly payments under our credit agreement based on our product revenue from net sales of FC2. Because such product revenue is based on when product revenue is recognized rather than when we collect on the related receivables, we may owe significant payments to the lenders before receipt of the cash for the sales. Upon maturity under our credit agreement, or an earlier change of control of Veru or sale of the FC2 business, we are required to make a payment to the lenders of all outstanding obligations (including a return premium) under the credit agreement.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of tax rules in the various jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our deferred tax assets, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Changes in enacted tax rates and the assumptions and estimates we have made, as well as actions we may take, could result in a write down of deferred tax assets or otherwise materially affect our tax obligations or effective tax rate, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our products.\n\ufeff\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights to our products, drug candidates and technology as well as successfully defending these rights against third party challenges. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical products are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot be certain that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States, such as the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We are limited in protecting our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties by the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\n\ufeff\nThese risks include the possibility of the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe patent applications that we have filed may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged or discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient, incomplete or incorrect information, and thus held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u00b7\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensor was not the first to make the invention covered by an issued patent or pending patent application;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensor was not the first inventor to file a patent application for the technology in the United States or was not the first to file a patent application directed to the technology abroad;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u00b7\nfuture drug candidates or our proprietary technologies may not be patentable or legal decisions limit patent-eligible subject matter;\n\u00b7\nothers will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights that we hold or license;\n\u00b7\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our drug candidates under patent protection;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products; and\n\u00b7\ninability to control patent prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any in-licensed intellectual property.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nOur or our licensors\u2019 patents may expire or be invalidated, found to be unenforceable, narrowed or otherwise limited or our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications may not result in issued patents or may result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims.\n\ufeff\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our licensors own or control such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\n\ufeff\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and our licensor\u2019s ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\n\ufeff\nWhile we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate, many third parties may already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities' applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with our patent applications or other intellectual property rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents, could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, commercialize or market our products. In addition, if third parties file patent applications which include claims covering any technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the USPTO, or foreign patent regulatory authorities to determine our rights in the technology, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged in the courts or in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO, or in similar proceedings in foreign countries. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims.\n\ufeff\nIf we or our licensors or strategic partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our drug candidates or future drug candidates, if approved, may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to patents prior to, or immediately following, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as \u201cat risk\u201d launches and compulsory licensing to challenge relevant patent rights.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nOur business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and trade secrets. If the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached, it could adversely impact our business.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent in part on some license relationships.\n\ufeff\nWe have acquired by license intellectual property and technology relating to our VERU-111 drug candidate, and might enter into additional licenses in the future. Licenses to which we are a party contain, and we expect that any future licenses will contain, provisions requiring up-front, milestone and royalty payments to licensors. If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to a licensor, that licensor might have the right to terminate the license on relatively short notice, in which event we would not be able to commercialize the drug candidates that were covered by the license. Also, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe have continuing obligations under our purchase agreements to acquire certain intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to an upfront payment that we made in connection with the acquisition of the intellectual property rights associated with Tamsulosin XR capsules and the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination, there are significant installment payments and milestone payments that are required to be made pursuant to the terms of the applicable purchase agreements. In addition, in some cases we granted a security interest in the purchased assets to the sellers to secure our present and future payment and performance obligations under the purchase agreements. Accordingly, there will be significant payments that we will be required to make in the future to the sellers of these assets and the failure to make such payments may result in us losing our rights to the intellectual property we acquired. If we fail to retain such rights, we would not be able to commercialize any products relating to the rights. In such event, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe may face claims that our intellectual property infringes on the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to commercialize our product candidates.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends, in part, on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any license, collaboration or other agreements we enter into with regard to our technologies and products. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in, and for the therapeutic targets for, which we intend to develop drugs. Patent applications are confidential when filed and remain confidential until publication, approximately 18 months after initial filing, while some patent applications remain unpublished until issuance. As such, there may be other third-party patents and pending applications of which we will be unaware with claims directed towards composition of matter, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or drug candidates. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty the nature or existence of every third-party patent filing. We cannot be sure that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our drug candidates as planned or that us or our licensors' and partners' patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties. If any third-party patent was held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of any of our drug candidates, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. We may not be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain such license may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThere is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensor\u2019s pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or our licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\n\ufeff\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims would be costly and time-consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, and could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management's attention from our business;\n\u00b7\nwe may have to pay substantial damages for past infringement if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor's patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\na court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless a third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u00b7\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; or\n\u00b7\nwe may need to redesign our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology or other intellectual property licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe must submit patent certifications in connection with the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway.\n\ufeff\nWe intend to submit NDAs for certain of our drug candidates under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA's prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product's listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time.\n\ufeff\nIf we cannot certify that all of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates have expired, we will be compelled to include a Paragraph IV certification in the NDA for such drug candidate. Our inability to certify that all of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates could have a serious and significant adverse effect on the timing for obtaining approval of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors.\n\ufeff\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may need to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or our licensor regarding our product candidates or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies create a regulatory environment that encourages companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\n\ufeff\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights, generally.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents or one of our licensor's patents is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of ours licensors, do not cover the technology in question or on other grounds. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries in which the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States or in those countries in which we do not file national phase patent applications. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may fail to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n\ufeff\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\ufeff\nOwnership in our common stock is highly concentrated and your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited as a result.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 10, 2019, our executive officers and directors collectively beneficially owned approximately 26.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including approximately 12.6% beneficially owned by each of Mitchell S. Steiner, M.D., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Harry Fisch, M.D., our Vice Chairman and Chief Corporate Officer. These shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning director elections, amendments to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders. The interests of such stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\n\ufeff\nCharges to earnings resulting from the APP Acquisition may cause our operating results to suffer.\n\ufeff\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we allocated the total purchase price of the APP Acquisition to APP's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their respective fair values as of the date of the APP Acquisition, and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Management's estimates of the fair value of such assets was based upon assumptions that they believed to be reasonable but that will be inherently uncertain. The following factors, among others, could result in material charges that would cause our financial results to be negatively impacted:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nimpairment of intangible assets, including in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d); and\n\u00b7\nimpairment of goodwill.\n\ufeff\nConsidering the high-risk nature of research and development and the industry\u2019s success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, charges relating to impairment of acquired IPR&D are likely to occur in future periods. Charges would be accounted for as expenses that would decrease net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required annually to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to deliver an annual attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be a non-accelerated filer if the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $75 million or more, in which case we would again be subject to the requirement for an annual attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements, and investors may therefore lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\n\ufeff\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\ufeff\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d We will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250 million or more and annual revenue as of our most recently completed fiscal year is $100 million or more, or the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700 million or more, regardless of annual revenue.\n\ufeff\nThere are provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law and our credit agreement that might prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a number of provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law and our credit agreement with SWK Funding LLC that may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe authority provided to our Board of Directors in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that permits shareholders to act by written consent only if such consent is unanimous;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that requires for a corporation such as us, that was formed before January 1, 1973, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our voting stock to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation, a merger submitted to a vote of our shareholders, or a sale of substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u00b7\nthe Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin's \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions which limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances; and\n\u00b7\nour credit agreement with SWK Funding LLC requires a mandatory prepayment upon a change of control of Veru or a sale of our FC2 business.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet market expectations for our performance;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product developments, acquisitions, or financial performance;\n\u00b7\nadverse results or delays in our clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or operating results;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new or updated research reports from securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions; or\n\u00b7\nother economic or external factors.\n\ufeff\nYou may be unable to sell your stock at or above your purchase price.\n\ufeff\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\n\ufeff\nIf the closing bid price of our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we may receive a letter from the staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC stating that our common stock will be delisted unless we are able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule requiring that we maintain a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share. We cannot guarantee that our stock price will continue to trade above $1.00 per share or otherwise meet the NASDAQ listing requirements and therefore our common stock may in the future be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\n\ufeff\nA substantial number of shares may be sold in the market, which may depress the market price for our common stock.\n\ufeff\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and shares of common stock we may issue under a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, including 4,021,467 shares of common stock that we have issued thereunder through the date of this report. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, sales of our common stock by our executive officers or directors, even when done during an open trading window under our policies with respect to insider sales may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Although we do not expect that the relatively small volume of such sales will itself significantly impact the trading price of our common stock, the market could react negatively to the announcement of such sales, which could in turn affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our shareholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\n\ufeff\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock since May 2014. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, our credit agreement with SWK Funding LLC restricts the payment of dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our shareholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 76461, "SIC": 3060, "TIC": "VERU"}
