RISK FACTORS\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect how we and our customers are operating our businesses.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the broader economies, financial markets and may affect the overall demand environment for our products and services.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized employee, customer and partner safety and temporarily shut down, slowed or limited activity in certain locations, including limiting production in certain locations to essential business needs, all in conjunction with federal, state and local health and safety regulations and shelter-in-place orders. As we transition to a hybrid work model, we have resumed the majority of our normal business operations with certain continued limitations on business travel, participation in trade shows, marketing activities, sales and development activities.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience disruption of our facilities, suppliers and contract manufacturers, which has and may continue to negatively impact our sales and operating results. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience shipping and logistics challenges and higher than expected supply chain and commodity costs, including manufacturing, logistics and procurement costs, due to inflationary pressure, among other factors. NSE has experienced some impact to customer demand. Customer demand will continue to be challenging to calibrate, due to the nature and timing of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs normal business operations resume and we transition to a hybrid work model, we are expanding globally the safety measures we have already undertaken at sites conducting essential business, such as enhanced sanitation procedures, health checks and social distancing protocols, none of which can completely eliminate the risk of exposure or spread of COVID-19. There could be additional waves or spikes in infection, again causing widespread social, economic and operational impacts.\nWe intend to comply with governmental vaccine and/or quarantine mandates. Such mandates, could, in some circumstances, result in skilled labor impacts including voluntary attrition or difficulty finding labor, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities, obtain supplies, or deliver our products in a timely manner. Some laws and directives may also hinder our ability to move certain products across borders. Economic conditions can also influence order patterns. These factors could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flow.\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets in many countries. In December 2021, we entered into a $300 million asset-based secured credit facility. If there is a long-term economic downturn or a prolonged recession as a result of the pandemic, we could face additional liquidity needs and challenges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.\nAny prolonged disruption of manufacturing of our products, commerce and related activity caused by the pandemic or significant decrease in demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Surges in infection rate, new shutdowns or quarantines, emergence of new and potentially more contagious variants of the virus and staffing and labor supply challenges may impact our suppliers and our ability to source materials in a timely manner. Further, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure could have a negative impact on our results. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our quarterly revenue and operating results as well as on our liquidity and on our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations, including the compliance with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness.\nWe refer you to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations\u201d under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Industry\nOur future profitability is not assured.\nOur profitability in a particular period will be impacted by revenue, product mix and operational costs that vary significantly across our product portfolio and business segments.\nSpecific factors that may undermine our profit and financial objectives include, among others:\n\u2022Uncertain future telecom carrier and cable operator capital and R&D spending levels, which particularly affects our NE and SE segments;\n\u2022Adverse changes to our product mix, both fundamentally (resulting from new product transitions, the declining profitability of certain legacy products and the termination of certain products with declining margins, among other things) and due to quarterly demand fluctuations;\n\u2022Pricing pressure across our NSE product lines due to competitive forces, advanced chip component shortages, and a highly concentrated customer base for many of our product lines, which may offset some of the cost improvements;\n\u2022Our OSP operating margin may experience some downward pressure as a result of a higher mix of 3D sensing products and increased operating expenses;\n\u2022Limited availability of components and resources for our products which leads to higher component prices;\n\u2022Resource rationing, including rationing of utilities like electricity by governments and/or service providers;\n\u2022Increasing commoditization of previously differentiated products, and the attendant negative effect on average selling prices and profit margins;\n\u2022Execution challenges, which limit revenue opportunities and harm profitability, market opportunities and customer relations;\n\u2022Decreased revenue associated with terminated or divested product lines;\n\u2022Redundant costs related to periodic transitioning of manufacturing and other functions to lower-cost locations;\n\u2022Ongoing costs associated with organizational transitions, consolidations and restructurings, which are expected to continue in the nearer term;\n\u2022Cyclical demand for our currency products;\n\u2022Changing market and economic conditions, including the impacts due to tariffs, the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, supply chain constraints, pricing and inflationary pressures;\n\u2022Ability of our customers, partners, manufacturers and suppliers to purchase, market, sell, manufacture and/or supply our products and services, including as a result of disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Financial stability of our customers, including the solvency of private sector customers and statutory authority for government customers to purchase goods and services; and\n\u2022Factors beyond our control resulting from pandemics and similar outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing restrictions, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders to control the spread of a disease regionally and globally, and limitations on the ability of our employees and our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 employees to work and travel.\nTaken together, these factors limit our ability to predict future profitability levels and to achieve our long-term profitability objectives. If we fail to achieve profitability expectations, the price of our debt and equity securities, as well as our business and financial condition, may be materially adversely impacted.\nRapid technological change in our industry presents us with significant risks and challenges, and if we are unable to keep up with the rapid changes, our customers may purchase less of our products.\nThe manufacture, quality and distribution of our products, as well as our customer relations, may be affected by several factors, including the rapidly changing market for our products, supply chain issues and internal restructuring efforts. We expect the impact of these issues will become more pronounced as we continue to introduce new product offerings and when overall demand increases.\nOur success depends upon our ability to deliver both our current product offerings and new products and technologies on time and at an acceptable cost to our customers. The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, substantial capital investment, changes in customer requirements and a constantly evolving industry. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these issues and provide solutions that meet our customers\u2019 current and future needs. As a technology company, we also constantly encounter quality, volume and cost concerns such as:\n\u2022Our continuing cost reduction programs which include site and organization consolidations, asset divestitures, outsourcing the manufacture of certain products to contract manufacturers, other outsourcing initiatives, and reductions in employee headcount, requirements related to re-establishment and re-qualification by our customers of complex manufacturing lines, and modifications to systems, planning and operational infrastructure. During this process, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, additional costs, delays in re-establishing volume production levels, planning difficulties, inventory issues, factory absorption concerns and systems integration problems.\n\u2022We have experienced variability of manufacturing yields caused by difficulties in the manufacturing process, the effects from a shift in product mix, changes in product specifications and the introduction of new product lines. These difficulties can reduce yields or disrupt production and thereby increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our margin.\n\u2022We may incur significant costs to correct defective products (despite rigorous testing for quality both by our customers and by us), which could include lost future sales of the affected product and other products, and potentially severe customer relations problems, litigation and damage to our reputation.\n\u2022We are dependent on a limited number of vendors, who are often small and specialized, for raw materials, packages and standard components. We also rely on contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture certain products. Our business could continue to be adversely affected by this dependency. Specific concerns we periodically encounter with our suppliers include stoppages or delays of supply, insufficient vendor resources to supply our requirements, substitution of more expensive or less reliable products, receipt of defective parts or contaminated materials, increases in the price of supplies and an inability to obtain reduced pricing from our suppliers in response to competitive pressures. Additionally, the ability of our contract manufacturers to fulfill their obligations may be affected by economic, political or other forces that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such failure could have a material impact on our ability to meet customers\u2019 expectations and may materially impact our operating results.\n\u2022New product programs and introductions involve changing product specifications and customer requirements, unanticipated engineering complexities, difficulties in reallocating resources and overcoming resource limitations and increased complexity, which expose us to yield and product risk internally and with our suppliers.\nThese factors have caused considerable strain on our execution capabilities and customer relations. We have and could continue to see periodic difficulty responding to customer delivery expectations for some of our products, and yield and quality problems, particularly with some of our new products and higher volume products which could require additional funds and other resources required to respond to these execution challenges. From time to time, we have had to divert resources from new product R&D and other functions to assist with resolving these matters. If we do not improve our performance in all of these areas, our operating results will be harmed, the commercial viability of new products may be challenged, and our customers may choose to reduce or terminate their purchases of our products and purchase additional products from our competitors.\nUnfavorable, uncertain or unexpected conditions in the transition to new technologies may cause our growth forecasts to be inaccurate and/or cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may not prove to be accurate. Our estimates of the market opportunities related to 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other developing technologies are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis, industry experience and third-party data. Accordingly, these markets may not develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate and our estimated market opportunities may prove to be materially inaccurate.\nIf domestic and global economic conditions worsen, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, pricing and inflationary pressures, overall spending on 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other developing technologies may be reduced, which would adversely impact demand for our products in these markets. In addition, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to such technologies may limit or slow the rate of global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations in these markets.\nOur growth and ability to serve a significant portion of these markets is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy and market adoption and expansion of 5G infrastructure, 3D sensing and other applications for consumer electronics. We cannot assure you that we will be able to serve a significant portion of these markets and the growth forecasts should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. Even if the markets and rates of adoption develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G platforms and systems, 3D sensing products and other technologies, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may experience increased pressure on our pricing and contract terms due to our reliance on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales.\nWe believe that we will continue to rely upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Any failure by us to continue capturing a significant share of these customers could materially harm our business. Dependence on a limited number of customers exposes us to the risk that order reductions from any one customer can have a material adverse effect on periodic revenue. Further, to the extent that there is consolidation among communications equipment manufacturers and service providers, we will have increased dependence on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms. Customer consolidation activity and periodic manufacturing and inventory initiatives could also create the potential for disruptions in demand for our products as a consequence of such customers streamlining, reducing or delaying purchasing decisions.\nWe have a strategic alliance with SICPA to market and sell our OVP and OVMP product lines for banknote anti-counterfeiting applications worldwide. A material reduction in sales, or loss of the relationship with SICPA, may harm our business and operating results as we may be unable to find a substitute marketing and sales partner or develop these capabilities ourselves in a timely manner.\nMovement towards virtualized networks and software solutions may result in lower demand for our hardware products and increased competition.\nThe markets for our NE and SE segments are increasingly looking towards virtualized networks and software solutions. While we are devoting substantial resources to meet these needs, this trend may result in lower demand for our legacy hardware products. Additionally, barriers to entry are generally lower for software solutions, which may lead to increased competition for our products and services.\nWe face a number of risks related to our strategic transactions.\nOur strategy continues to include periodic acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and technologies. Strategic transactions of this nature involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022Diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process R&D;\n\u2022Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022Difficulties in obtaining or providing sufficient transition services and accurately projecting the time and cost associated with providing these services;\n\u2022An acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments;\n\u2022Expected earn-outs may not be achieved in the time frame or at the level expected or at all;\n\u2022We may not be able to recognize or capitalize on expected growth, synergies or cost savings;\n\u2022Insufficient net revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022Potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u2022Difficulty in forecasting revenues and margins;\n\u2022The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any other adverse public health developments, epidemic disease or other pandemic in the countries in which we operate or our customers are located, including regional quarantines restricting the movement of people or goods, reductions in labor supply or staffing, the closure of facilities to protect employees, including those of our customers, disruptions to global supply chains and both our and our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver materials and products on a timely or cost-effective basis, shipment, acceptance or verification delays, the resulting overall significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and economic instability affecting customer spending patterns; and\n\u2022Inadequate internal control procedures and disclosure controls to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or poor integration of a target company\u2019s or business\u2019s procedures and controls.\nAcquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u2022Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership and may decrease earnings per share;\n\u2022Assume liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of the acquisitions;\n\u2022Record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022Incur additional debt to finance such acquisitions;\n\u2022Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; or\n\u2022Acquire, assume, or become subject to litigation related to the acquired businesses or assets.\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development strategy.\nDeveloping our products is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. We expect to continue to invest heavily in R&D in order to expand the capabilities of 3D sensing and smart phone sensors, handheld spectrometer solution and portable test instruments, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology. We expect that our results of operations may be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. In addition, these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\nOperational Risks\nRestructuring\nWe have from time to time engaged in restructuring activities to realign our cost base with current and anticipated future market conditions. Significant risks associated with these types of actions that may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated cost reductions or disrupt our business include delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the U.S. and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of key employees. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to our international operations and revenue.\nOur customers are located throughout the world. In addition, we have significant operations outside North America, including product development, manufacturing, sales and customer support operations.\nOur international presence exposes us to certain risks, including the following:\n\u2022Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and among the currencies of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our operating results by negatively impacting our revenues or increasing our expenses;\n\u2022Our ability to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business, including, among other things, customs, import/export, anti-bribery, anti-competition, tax and data privacy laws, which may be subject to sudden and unexpected changes;\n\u2022Difficulties in establishing and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022Tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022Political, legal and economic instability in foreign markets, particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and product development facilities;\n\u2022Strained or worsening relations between the United States, Russia and China and related impacts on other countries;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and management;\n\u2022Language and cultural barriers;\n\u2022Seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located;\n\u2022Integration of foreign operations;\n\u2022Longer payment cycles;\n\u2022Difficulties in management of foreign distributors; and\n\u2022Potential adverse tax consequences.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has and is likely to continue to affect the manufacturing and shipment of goods globally. Any delay in production or delivery of our products due to an extended closure of our suppliers\u2019 plants as a result of efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact our business. Worldwide travel restrictions have been imposed by many countries, including air travel and transport, that have caused and are likely to continue to cause delays in shipment of our products as well as increased logistics costs.\nWe expect that net revenue from customers outside North America will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue. Lower sales levels that typically occur during the summer months in Europe and some other overseas markets may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, the revenues we derive from many of our customers depend on international sales and further expose us to the risks associated with such international sales.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nCertain of our products are subject to governmental and industry regulations, certifications and approvals.\nThe commercialization of certain of the products we design, manufacture and distribute through our OSP segment may be more costly due to required government approval and industry acceptance processes. Development of applications for our anti-counterfeiting and special effects pigments may require significant testing that could delay our sales. For example, durability testing by the automobile industry of our special effects pigments used with automotive paints can take up to three years. If we change a product for any reason, including technological changes or changes in the manufacturing process, prior approvals or certifications may be invalid and we may need to go through the approval process again. If we are unable to obtain these or other government or industry certifications in a timely manner, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nU.S. Government trade actions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, and results of operation.\nThe United States and China have been engaged in protracted negotiations over the Chinese government\u2019s acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. For example, the United States has increased tariffs on certain categories of high-tech and consumer goods imported from China pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, including a current 25% tariff on List 1, List 2 and List 3 goods, which lists cover certain materials and/or products that we import from China.\nOn May 16, 2019, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and 68 designated non-U.S. affiliates (collectively, Huawei) were added to the Entity List of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei. On August 17, 2020, BIS issued final rules that further restrict access by Huawei to items produced domestically and abroad from U.S. technology and software. While the majority of our products were unaffected, the final rules prevent us from selling certain products to Huawei entities without a license issued subject to the Export Administration Regulations. If we are unable to obtain such a license, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThese measures, along with any additional tariffs or other trade actions that may be implemented, may increase the cost of certain materials and/or products that we import from China, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. These actions could require us to raise our prices, which could decrease demand for our products. As a result, these actions, including potential retaliatory measures by China and further escalation into a potential \u201ctrade war\u201d, may adversely impact our business.\nFurthermore, the geopolitical and economic uncertainty and/or instability that may result from changes in the relationship among the United States, Taiwan and China, may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain of our suppliers are dependent on products sourced from Taiwan which has been distinguished in its prevalence in certain global markets, most specifically semiconductor manufacturing. Hence, greater restrictions and/or disruptions of our suppliers\u2019 ability to operate facilities and/or do business in and with Taiwan may increase the cost of certain materials and/or limit the supply of products sourced from Taiwan and may result in deterioration of our profit margins, a potential need to increase our pricing and, in so doing, may decrease demand for our products and thereby adversely impact our revenue or profitability.\nDue to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S., E.U. and U.K. have broadened restrictions on exports to Russia, thereby blocking shipments of technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics products to Russia. This caused us to suspend transactions in the region effective February 2022 and has negatively impacted our business in the region. Sales in the region are not material to our total consolidated revenues or net income and we are not aware of any specific event or circumstances that would require an update to the estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities at this time. However, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates assumptions or conditions due to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing situation in Ukraine as well as the potential for additional trade actions or retaliatory cyber-attacks aimed at infrastructure or supply chains, the impact on our future operations and results in the region remains uncertain.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may harm our business.\nComplex local, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and allow such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, there are five new state privacy laws that will go into effect in 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and a number of other states are considering similar laws. In addition, a federal privacy bill, called the American Data Privacy and Protection Act was recently published. The new state privacy laws and proposed federal law will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The new and proposed privacy laws may result in further uncertainty and would require us to incur additional expenditures to comply. These regulations and legislative developments have potentially far-reaching consequences and may require us to modify our data management practices and incur substantial compliance expense.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.\nInformation Security, Technology and Intellectual Property Risks\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. In some cases, we rely upon third-party hosting and support services to meet these needs. The internet has experienced an increase in cyber threats in the form of phishing emails, malware attachments and malicious websites. The growing and evolving cyber-risk environment means that individuals, companies, and organizations of all sizes, including ourselves and our hosting and support partners, are increasingly vulnerable to attacks and disruptions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors on an ongoing and regular basis. We also design and manage IT systems and products that contain IT systems for various customers, and generally face the same threats for these systems as for our own internal systems.\nWe maintain information security tools and technologies, staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our networks and information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber-security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber-security threats. Our network security controls are comprised of administrative, physical and technical controls, which include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, anti-virus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, off-site storage, network audits and other routine updates and modifications. We also routinely monitor and develop our internal information technology systems to address risks to our information systems. Despite our implementation of these and other security measures and those of our third-party vendors, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions and attacks that continue to emerge and evolve. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our business processes, network degradation, and system down time, along with the potential that a third-party will gain unauthorized access to, or acquire intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to our employees, customers, suppliers, and business partners, including personal data. To the extent that any disruption, degradation, downtime or other security event results in a loss or damage to our data or systems, or in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or personal information, it could adversely impact us and our clients, potentially resulting in, among other things, financial losses, loss of customers or business, our inability to transact business on behalf of our clients, adverse impact on our brand and reputation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, litigation, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. We may also incur additional costs related to cyber-security risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events. No assurances can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.\nIf we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those we have, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe seek to protect our products and our product roadmaps in part by developing and/or securing proprietary rights relating to those products, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. The steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. Other companies may be investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to our own. It is possible that patents may not be issued from any of our pending applications or those we may file in the future and, if patents are issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from making, using or selling products that are similar to ours. We do not own patents in every country in which we sell or distribute our products, and thus others may be able to offer identical products in countries where we do not have intellectual property protection. In addition, the laws of some territories in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including Europe, Asia-Pacific or Latin America, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nAny patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Additionally, we are currently a licensee in all of our operating segments for a number of third-party technologies, software and intellectual property rights from academic institutions, our competitors and others, and are required to pay royalties to these licensors for the use thereof. Unless we are able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, patents or other intellectual property held by others could inhibit our development of new products, impede the sale of some of our current products, substantially increase the cost to provide these products to our customers, and could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. In the past, licenses generally have been available to us where third-party technology was necessary or useful for the development or production of our products. In the future licenses to third-party technology may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur products may be subject to claims that they infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nLawsuits and allegations of patent infringement and violation of other intellectual property rights occur in our industry on a regular basis. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, notices from third parties claiming that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Over the past several years there has been a marked increase in the number and potential severity of third-party patent infringement claims, primarily from two distinct sources. First, large technology companies, including some of our customers and competitors, are seeking to monetize their patent portfolios and have developed large internal organizations that have approached us with demands to enter into license agreements. Second, patent-holding companies, entities that do not make or sell products (often referred to as \u201cpatent trolls\u201d), have claimed that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights. We will continue to respond to these claims in the course of our business operations. In the past, the resolution of these disputes has not had a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition; however, this may not be the case in the future. Further, the litigation or settlement of these matters, regardless of the merit of the claims, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful. If we are unsuccessful, we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation. We may not be successful in such development, or such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Without such a license, we could be enjoined from future sales of the infringing product or products, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nThe use of open-source software in our products, as well as those of our suppliers, manufacturers and customers, may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property position.\nCertain of the software and/or firmware that we use and distribute (as well as that of our suppliers, manufacturers and customers) may be, be derived from, or contain, \u201copen source\u201d software, which is software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Such open-source software is often made available under licenses which impose obligations in the event the software or derivative works thereof are distributed or re-distributed. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our own software products. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open-source software, in the event that a court rules that these licenses are unenforceable, or in the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work. Additionally, open-source licenses are subject to occasional revision. In the event future iterations of open-source software are made available under a revised license, such license revisions may adversely affect our ability to use such future iterations.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Risks\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities which could increase our expenses and harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the environment, including those governing pollution and protection of human health and the environment and, recently, those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and holding producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, are often complex and are subject to frequent changes. We will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, as well as all environmental laws and regulations, and as appropriate or required, that our component suppliers also comply with such laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with such laws, we could face sanctions for such noncompliance, and our customers may refuse to purchase our products, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in general, we have incurred, and in the future could incur, substantial costs for the cleanup of contaminated properties, either those we own or operate or to which we have sent wastes in the past, or to comply with such environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, we could be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics as a result of such clean-up or compliance obligations. If we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines and liability for damages resulting from such violations. If we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws, or if we are subject to significant expenditures in connection with a violation of these laws, our financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur disclosures, initiatives and goals related to ESG matters expose us to numerous risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. We may communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG matters, in our ESG Report, on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to risks related to climate change, natural disasters and catastrophic events.\nWe operate in geographic regions which face a number of climate and environmental challenges. Our new corporate headquarters are located in Chandler, Arizona, a desert climate, subject to extreme heat and drought. The geographic location of our Northern California offices and production facilities subject them to drought, earthquake and wildfire risks. It is impossible to predict the timing, magnitude or location of such natural disasters or their impacts on the local economy and on our operations. If a major earthquake, wildfire or other natural disaster were to damage or destroy our facilities or manufacturing equipment, we may experience potential impacts ranging from production and shipping delays to lost profits and revenues. In October 2017 and again in October 2019, we temporarily closed our Santa Rosa, California facility resulting in production stoppage, due to wildfires in the region and the facility\u2019s close proximity to the wildfire evacuation zone. The location of our production facility could subject us to production delays and/or equipment and property damage. Moreover, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), the public electric utility in our Northern California region, has previously implemented and may continue to implement widespread blackouts during the peak wildfire season to avoid and contain wildfires sparked during strong wind events by downed power lines or equipment failure. While we have not experienced damage to our facilities or a material disruption to operations as a result of these power outages, ongoing blackouts, particularly if prolonged or frequent, could impact our operations going forward.\nManagement transitions and talent retention create uncertainties and could harm our business.\nManagement changes could adversely impact our results of operations and our customer relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Our executives and other key personnel are at-will employees and we generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our other employees, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. We have recently and could continue to experience changes in our leadership team. Competition for people with the specific technical and other skills we require is significant. Moreover, we may face new and unanticipated difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees in connection with the change of our headquarters to Chandler, Arizona. As remote work has become more available the competition for highly qualified talent has intensified. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified executives and employees, or to successfully integrate any newly hired personnel within our organization, we may be unable to achieve our operating objectives, which could negatively impact our financial performance and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Liquidity and Indebtedness\nAny deterioration or disruption of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding.\nGlobal economic conditions have caused and may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. When the capital or credit markets deteriorate or are disrupted, our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of our working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, or to refinance maturing obligations as they become due, may be constrained. In the event that we were to seek to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. We may seek to access the capital or credit markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. For example, in December 2021, we entered into a $300 million asset-based secured credit facility which has certain limitations based on our borrowing capacity. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and terms we receive in the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in financial markets and interest rates. In addition, if we do access the capital or credit markets, agreements governing any borrowing arrangement could contain covenants restricting our operations.\nOur notes increased our overall leverage and our convertible notes could dilute our existing stockholders and lower our reported earnings per share.\nThe issuance of our 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024, our 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, and our 3.75% Senior Notes due 2029 (together the \u201cNotes\u201d) substantially increased our principal payment obligations. The degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully obtain financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures. In addition, the holders of the 2023 and 2024 Notes are entitled to convert the Notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock under certain circumstances which would dilute our existing stockholders and lower our reported per share earnings.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur outstanding indebtedness may limit our operational and financial flexibility.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022Impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations;\n\u2022Limiting our ability to grow and make capital expenditures due to the financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements;\n\u2022Impairing our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, invest in new or developing technologies, or take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022Making us more vulnerable if a general economic downturn occurs or if our business experiences difficulties; and\n\u2022Resulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or our other debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the Notes, or any other debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.\nWe will need to implement our business strategy successfully on a timely basis to meet our debt service and working capital needs. We may not successfully implement our business strategy, and even if we do, we may not realize the anticipated results of our strategy and generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and working capital needs. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the event our cash flow is inadequate to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required, to the extent permitted under the indentures covering the Notes and any other debt agreements, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Any insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures that govern the Notes and the agreement that governs our secured credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the agreements governing our existing debt.\nThe terms of the indentures that govern the Notes and the agreement that governs our secured credit facility restrict our current and future operations.\nThe indentures governing the Notes and the agreement governing the secured credit facility contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022Incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness;\n\u2022Make investments;\n\u2022Consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022Sell assets;\n\u2022Pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022Amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022Enter into certain restrictive agreements;\n\u2022Engage in a new line of business;\n\u2022Amend certain material agreements, including material leases and debt agreements; and\n\u2022Enter into sale leaseback transactions.\nTax Risks\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and/or changes in regulations.\nChanges in U.S. federal income or other tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, as recently passed by Congress, may impact our tax liabilities. Utilization of our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation if the ownership change limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions are triggered by changes in the ownership of our capital stock. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Accordingly, purchases of our capital stock by others could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in the future.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Due to uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of our future profitability, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset our U.S. and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets because of uncertainty related to our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards before they expire.\nIf any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards.\nGeneral Risks\nCertain provisions in our charter and under Delaware laws could hinder a takeover attempt.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section\u202f203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short-term, to the interests of the stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions providing for the limitations of liability and indemnification of our directors and officers, allowing vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, granting our Board of Directors the authority to establish additional series of preferred stock and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares (commonly known as \u201cblank check preferred\u201d) and providing that our stockholders can take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders, which may only be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. These provisions may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or change in our management.", "PERMNO": 79879, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "VIAV"}
