As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock;\n\u25cf Risks Related to Doing Business in China\n\u25cb Substantial uncertainties and restrictions on the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition and may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors;\n\u25cb Adverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like us with China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements;\n\u25cb Compliance with China\u2019s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business; The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval;\n\u25cb It may be difficult for U.S. regulators, such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, and other authorities, to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China;\n\u25cb The economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected;\n\u25cb Changes in currency conversion policies in China and fluctuation in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our securities;\n\u25cb Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us or our management;\n\u25cb Changes to the government\u2019s subsidy support policies and further delays in subsidy payments may have negative impacts on our operations;\n\u25cf Risks Associated With the Export of Kandi Electric Vehicles to and sale in the United States\n\u25cb Failures in our overseas business and export trade processes may present a risk of significant losses to our business;\n\u25cb The developed countries that import our products have strict environmental laws and regulations which may cause us to expend significant sums to comply with such laws and regulations;\n\u25cb Our short-term financial performance may suffer due to our investment in expanding our presence and sales in the United States;\n\u25cb Lack of authorized dealers and absence of after-sales maintenance may adversely affect our business in the United States;\n\u25cf Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities\n\u25cb Our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses for our shareholders;\n\u25cb We do not anticipate paying cash dividends to our common shareholders;\n\u25cb Limited monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware Law and the existence of statutory indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees;\n\u25cb We may require additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders;\n\u25cb Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance;\n\u25cb Techniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur future growth is dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt our products.\nOur PRC operating entities\u2019 growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and they are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles in particular. The market for alternative fuel vehicles and pure electric off-road vehicles is relatively new and rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. If the market for EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles in China does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our Products.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced EV products and Pure Electric off-road vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nIf our PRC operating entities are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle and pure electric off-road vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.\nOur PRC operating entities may be unable to keep up with changes in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology, and they may suffer a resulting decline in the competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology would result in a decline in their competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology. As technologies change, our PRC operating entities plan to upgrade or adapt the vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our PRC operating entities\u2019 vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles and pure electric off-road vehicles if they are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into their vehicles. For example, our PRC operating entities do not manufacture battery cells, which makes them dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success depends substantially on the continued services of our executive officers, especially our CEO and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Hu Xiaoming. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers. If any of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Therefore, our business may be severely disrupted, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers. In addition, if any of our executive officers joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers.\nOur PRC operating entities may be subject to product liability claims or recalls which could be expensive, damage our reputation or result in a diversion of management resources.\nOur PRC operating entities may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of the vehicles that they sell or produce. We may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.\nOur PRC operating entities may also be required to participate in recalls involving our vehicles, if any (including the products SC Autosports sell in the U.S.) proves to be defective, or our PRC operating entities may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships. Such a recall would result in a diversion of resources. While our PRC operating entities do maintain product liability insurance, we cannot assure investors that it will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nWe and our PRC operating entities retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.\nWe and our operating companies use the electronic systems of our vehicles to log information about each vehicle\u2019s condition, performance and use in order to aid us in providing customer service, including vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance, as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers\u2019 charge time, battery usage, mileage and efficiency habits and to improve our vehicles. We also collect information about our customers through our website, at our stores and facilities, and via telephone.\nOur customers may object to the processing of this data, which may negatively impact our ability to provide effective customer service and develop new vehicles and products. Collection and use of our customers\u2019 personal information in conducting our business may be subject to national and local laws and regulations in China, and such laws and regulations may restrict our processing of such personal information and hinder our ability to attract new customers or market to existing customers. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nOur PRC operating entities\u2019 business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\nAny failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in the weakening or loss of such rights, which may allow our competitors to offer similar or identical products or use identical or confusingly similar branding, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage, a decrease in our revenue or an attribution of potentially lower quality products to us, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright protection, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.\nThe protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities. However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u25cf our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our commercial endeavors;\n\u25cf the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented technology or for other reasons;\n\u25cf the costs associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable; or\n\u25cf current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our intellectual property.\nExisting trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protections. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and seek licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf cease selling, incorporating or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u25cf redesign our vehicles or other goods or services.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nWe may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others. In such cases, we may seek indemnification from our licensors/suppliers under our contracts with them. However, indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors.\nOur PRC operating entities\u2019 vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have the potential to catch fire or vent smoke and flame. This may lead to additional concerns about batteries used in automotive applications.\nThe battery packs in our EV products and pure electric off-road vehicles make use of lithium-ion cells. Our PRC operating entities also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in battery packs on any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and EV battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells.\nThese events have raised concerns about batteries used in EV products and pure electric off-road vehicles applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of battery cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. Our PRC operating entities may have to recall their vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains their battery packs, or redesign their battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, our PRC operating entities store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While our PRC operating entities have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our EV products. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nCompliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines.\nThe business operations of our PRC operating entities generate noise, waste water, gaseous byproduct and other industrial waste. Our PRC operating entities are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding the protection of the environment. Our PRC operating entities are in compliance with current environmental protection requirements and have all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. However, if more stringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new regulations could be substantial. Additionally, if our PRC operating entities fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, they may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by our PRC operating entities to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the unauthorized discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions to our business operations. Certain laws, ordinances and regulations could limit our ability to develop, use, or sell our products.\nOur high concentration of sales to relatively few customers may result in significant impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our operating subsidiaries\u2019 major customers (above 10% of the total revenue), in the aggregate, accounted for 29% and 38%, respectively, of their sales. Due to the concentration of sales to relatively few customers including the Affiliate Company, loss of one or more of these customers will have relatively high impact on their operational results.\nOur business is subject to the risk of supplier concentrations.\nOur operating subsidiaries depend on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of major components and parts and principal raw materials. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the major suppliers (above 10% of the total purchases) of our operating subsidiaries accounted for 50% and 71% of their purchases, respectively. As a result of this concentration in our supply chain, our operating subsidiaries\u2019 business and operations would be negatively affected if any of their key suppliers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of these suppliers, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of these suppliers, could result in lost revenue, added costs and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, concentration in our supply chain can exacerbate our exposure to risks associated with the termination by key suppliers of our distribution agreements or any adverse change in the terms of such agreements, which could have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability.\nOur facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters, epidemics or other unpredictable events.\nOur headquarters and facilities are located in several cities in China such as Jinhua, Yongkang and Haikou. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. For example, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the outbreak of COVID-19. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in China, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers. Any disruption or delay of our operation and those of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers would adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of China and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and we may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPandemic COVID-19 may adversely impact the transportation industry and our business.\nOur PRC operating entities\u2019 ability to manufacture and/or sell their products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of their suppliers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from factors that are hard to predict or are beyond our control, such as natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events.\nThe spread of COVID-19 around China and other parts of the world has caused significant volatility in the markets of China, U.S., and the rest of the world. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in China and elsewhere. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our PRC operating entities\u2019 operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or minimize its harm, among others.\nFailure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results. Disputes with significant suppliers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results. Our PRC operating entities are actively monitoring the recent coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact on their supply chain and operations. Due to current and potential future port closures and other restrictions resulting from the outbreak, global supply may become constrained, which may cause the negative impact on our sale of off-road vehicles to the U.S. While we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and effectiveness of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities.\nOur EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles may not perform in line with customer expectations.\nOur EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles may not perform in line with customers\u2019 expectations. For example, our vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of other vehicles in the market, and may not be as easy and convenient to repair as other vehicles in the market. Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIn addition, the range of our vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. For example, a customer\u2019s use of his or her EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles as well as the frequency with which he or she charges the battery can result in additional deterioration of the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge.\nFurthermore, our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. While we have performed extensive internal testing on our vehicles\u2019 software and hardware systems, we have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our systems and vehicles. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. If any of our vehicles fail to perform as expected, we may need to delay deliveries, initiate product recalls and provide servicing or updates under warranty at our expense, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports.\nAlthough we continue to maintain and improve our internal control procedures, we cannot provide assurance that we will not fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment on an ongoing basis, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nSubstantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations conducted through our PRC operating entities may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing reform policies which have adversely affected China-based operating companies whose securities are listed in the United States, with significant policies changes being made from time to time without notice. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements. Only after 1979 did the Chinese government begin to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws that regulate economic affairs in general, deal with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, as well as encourage foreign investment in China. Although the influence of the law has been increasing, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Also, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. In addition, there have been constant changes and amendments of laws and regulations over the past 30 years in order to keep up with the rapidly changing society and economy in China. Because government agencies and courts provide interpretations of laws and regulations and decide contractual disputes and issues, their inexperience in adjudicating new business and new polices or regulations in certain less developed areas causes uncertainty and may affect our operating entities\u2019 business. Consequently, we cannot predict the future direction of Chinese legislative activities with respect to either businesses with foreign investment or the effectiveness on enforcement of laws and regulations in China. The uncertainties, including new laws and regulations and changes of existing laws, as well as judicial interpretation by inexperienced officials in the agencies and courts in certain areas, may cause possible problems to foreign investors. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the securities being offered. Any adverse changes in Chinese laws and regulations and the Chinese government\u2019s significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nAdverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like us with China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements.\nThe recent regulatory developments in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition, we may be subject to industry-wide regulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of restricting the scope of our operations in China, or causing the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner or at all.\nOn July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies before their registration statements will be declared effective. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in China, and that both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to tightened regulatory review and we could be exposed to government interference in China.\nCompliance with China\u2019s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.\nChina has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China\u2019s new Data Security Law took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on \u201cdata classification and hierarchical protection system\u201d for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s Cyber Security Law requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity\u2019s information and network systems belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to a series of national standards on the grading and implementation of the classified protection of cyber security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval.\nRecently, the Cyberspace Administration of China has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at \u201cpreventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public interests.\u201d On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.\nIt is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on our business. China\u2019s regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.\nAlso, recently, the National People\u2019s Congress released the Personal Information Protection Law, which has become effective on November 1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year and may also be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities.\nInterpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market.\nThe approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, require an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Currently, there is no consensus among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.\nBased on our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations in effect at the time of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of an offering in a foreseeable future and the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq. However, there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and our belief is subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules or overseas offering approval. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.\nRecently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the \u201cOpinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law,\u201d or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which required that, among others, in addition to \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d, any \u201cdata processor\u201d controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities. We do not believe we are among the \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d or \u201cdata processor\u201d as mentioned above. Based on the above and our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations currently in effect as of the date of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC or the CAC for the approval of a future offering and the listing and trading of our securities on the Nasdaq. However, the revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review is in the process of being formulated and the Opinions remain unclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. Thus, it is still uncertain how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals. Furthermore, if the CSRC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for future offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain such approvals which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. For instance, in the event that the CSRC approval or any regulatory approval is required for a future offering, or if the CSRC or any other PRC government authorities promulgates any new laws, rules or regulations or any interpretation or implements rules before our listing that would require us to obtain the CSRC or any other governmental approval for a future offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies if we fail to seek CSRC approval for such future offering. These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from a future offering into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt a future offering before the settlement and delivery of the securities that we offer. Consequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement and delivery of the securities we offer, you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur. Any uncertainties or negative publicity regarding such approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete any follow-on offering of our securities or the market for and market price of our common stock.\nIt may be difficult for U.S. regulators, such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, and other authorities, to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigations initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with regulatory authorities in the Unities States-including the SEC and the Department of Justice-may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the PRC territory. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase the difficulties you face in protecting your interests.\nOur auditor, Paris, Kreit & Chiu CPA LLP is headquartered in New York, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. To the extent that our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company become located in China, the PCAOB may not be able inspect such audit documentation and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our ordinary shares could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nAs auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor\u2019s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. We are required by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. While our present auditor is located in the United States and the PCAOB is able to conduct inspections on such auditor, to the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB, our ordinary shares could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nThe economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe rapid growth of the Chinese economy had historically resulted in widespread growth opportunities for industries across China. This growth has slowed in the recent years. As a result of the global financial crisis and the inability of enterprises to gain comparable access to the same amounts of capital available in past years, there may be an adverse effect on the business climate and growth of private enterprises in China. An economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on our sales and may increase our costs. Further, if economic growth continues to slow, and if, in conjunction, inflation continues unchecked, our costs would be likely to increase, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to increase our prices to an extent that would offset the increase in our expenses.\nIn addition, a tightened labor markets in our geographic region may result in fewer qualified applicants for job openings in our facilities. Further, higher wages, related labor costs and other increasing cost trends may negatively impact our results.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has significantly slowed down China\u2019s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth. According to an article titled \u201cChina\u2019s Economy Shrinks, Ending a Nearly Half-Century of Growth\u201d published on the New York Times on April 18, 2020, Chinese officials said that China\u2019s economy shrank 6.8 percent in the first three months of 2020 compared with a year ago. The data reflects China\u2019s drastic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people. Although China has managed a turnaround during the fourth quarter of 2020, we cannot predict how China\u2019s economy will develop amid the significant uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could have a material adverse effect on us and may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors.\nChina\u2019s legal system is based on statutory law. Unlike the common law system, statutory law is based primarily on written statutes. Previous court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have a binding effect. Since 1979, the Chinese government has been promulgating and amending laws and regulations regarding economic matters, such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new, and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretation of many laws, regulations and rules is not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us.\nIn addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. The legal system in China cannot provide investors with the same level of protection as in the U.S. The Company is governed by laws and regulations generally applicable to local enterprises in China. Many of these laws and regulations were recently introduced and remain experimental in nature and subject to changes and refinements. Interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the existing laws and regulations can be uncertain and unpredictable and therefore may restrict the legal protections available to foreign investors.\nChanges in currency conversion policies in China may have a material adverse effect on us.\nRenminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) is still not a freely exchangeable currency. Since 1998, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China has promulgated a series of circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under Chinese entity\u2019s current account items, and has imposed strict requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors.\nThis may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans, the creation of foreign security, and the borrowing of RMB under guarantees in foreign currencies. Moreover, the value of RMB may become subject to supply and demand, which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments. Any fluctuations in the exchange rate of RMB could have an adverse effect on the operational and financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries in China.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations.\nInvestors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us or our management.\nWe, through our PRC operating entities, conduct substantially all of our operations in China and almost all of our assets are located in China. In addition, almost all of our senior executive officers reside in China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process on our senior executive officers within the United States or elsewhere outside China, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court orders and final judgments.\nChanges to the government\u2019s subsidy support policies and further delays in subsidy payments may have negative impacts on our operations.\nOn March 31, 2020, in order to promote automobile consumption, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to extend two preferential policies of new energy vehicle purchase subsidy and vehicle purchase tax exemption for another two years, which were originally due at the end 2020. However, there is no assurance that such favorable policies will be further extended when they become due in two years. Any unfavorable changes of the policies, the unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Associated With the Export of Kandi Electric Vehicles to and sale in the United States\nOur intellectual property rights may be harmed by competitors preemptively filing legitimate and illegitimate patents, which could create significant barriers for our business by preventing us from adequately protecting our intellectual property.\nMultinational automobile companies usually obtain patent portfolios consisting of basic patents and peripheral patents on improvements and related technologies, thereby creating patent barriers in the industry. At the same time, certain multinational automobile companies also maliciously apply for patents, in order to obtain an unlawful competitive advantage or to directly receive invalid rights and use patents as weapons in litigation. New energy vehicles are emerging products in worldwide markets in recent years, while relevant and related patents in the industry are still in force. Kandi may be seriously adversely affected by intellectual property rights barriers through participation in the competitive international automobile market. Therefore, Kandi faces risks of patent barriers and intellectual property litigation in the future.\nFailures in our overseas business and export trade processes may present a risk of significant losses to our business.\nOur automobile product export and overseas operations sections involve import and export currency exchange, insurance, ocean transportation, customs clearance and various other logistical procedures. A loss of trust in any part of the chain can lead to the failure of transactions, which in turn causes huge losses to our enterprise. In the future, the Company will expand its overseas market. An insufficient assessment of the capital strength and commercial credit of its partners, or any fraud in risk prevention and risk control systems may cause economic losses for the Company due to its business partners\u2019 breach of contract or even fraud. In short, the export of Kandi electric vehicles to the United States may have risks in the overseas operation and export trade process.\nThe developed countries that import our products have strict environmental laws and regulations which may cause us to expend significant sums to comply with such laws and regulations.\nThe United States and other developed countries have strong awareness of environmental protection and product safety regulations. The penalties for violating environmental laws in such countries are extremely high. Developed countries have mature and highly saturated automobile markets. Costs associated with maintaining controls over atmospheric emissions, harmful toxic substances, and products safety are getting higher in an accelerated manner. The process for a company to obtain the applicable certifications is time-consuming, complicated and expensive. Kandi will also face the adverse impact of compliance with policy and regulatory standards in the United States. Thus, Kandi may face the risk of not being able to sustain its business in accordance with US and state environmental protection and product safety policies and regulations.\nOur short-term financial performance may suffer due to our investment in expanding our presence and sales in the United States.\nChinese auto products have market competition disadvantages in terms of technology content, product structure, product quality and brand influence. It is difficult to reverse the sentiment of \u201clow quality and low price\u201d that has followed Chinese automobiles for a long time, resulting in weakened bargaining power for Chinese auto companies and generally low gross profit margins. Kandi is expanding into the US market and rely on overseas distributors to establish a marketing network and after-sales service guarantee system. All actions require the Company to invest a certain amount of resources. Additionally electric vehicle sales may face a slow growth period. In a certain period of time, the growth of operating income lags behind the increase in sales inputs. At the same time, the Company cannot predict the direct economic loss caused by an unsatisfactory market expansion caused by the adverse factors of market competition. Cash flows for Kandi and SC Autosports may be significantly adversely affected by large investments and small revenues in the short term. Therefore, there may be a risk that the short-term financial performance indicators will fall due to factors such as the expansion of resources in overseas markets.\nRisks Associated With lack of authorized dealer and the absence of after-sales maintenance.\nOur electric vehicles in China are mainly directly sold to the online car-hailing platform, not through dealers.\nIn U.S. market, without authorized dealers, the delivery of EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles may be delayed. Hence customers may delay, reduce or cancel the purchase orders of our EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles, and our business operations may be adversely affected. At the same time, in the absence of after-sales maintenance by the dealers, not only the cost and complexity of maintenance will be increased, it will also affect customers\u2019 access to warranty and other after-sales service support, which may then weaken customers\u2019 confidence in our brand, and we may even encounter potential lawsuits due to lack of support to the customers. This can affect our brand and business, and bring an adverse impact to the financial condition and operating performance of the Company.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses for our shareholders.\nThe stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations. Although our stock has been trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since January 2, 2014, the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel; or\n\u25cf general sentiment on China-based companies\u2019 securities.\nDomestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nMr. Hu, our CEO, President and Chairman of our Board, is the beneficial owner of a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which may enable Mr. Hu to exert significant influence on corporate actions.\nExcelvantage Group Limited controls approximately 16.72% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2021. Hu Xiaoming, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, is the sole stockholder of Excelvantage Group Limited. Together with the shares held through Excelvantage Group Limited, Mr. Hu controls 18.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in control, even if these actions would benefit our other shareholders and the Company. This control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends to our common shareholders.\nWe presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board. We presently intend to retain all earnings in order to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future.\nThe limitation of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware Law and the existence of statutory indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation does not contain any specific provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the Company or shareholders; however, we are prepared to indemnify our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Delaware law. We may also have included contractual indemnification obligations in our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against its directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage the Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and shareholders.\nWe may require additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nIn the future, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure investors that financing will be available, if at all, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometimes known as \u201cdisclosed shorts\u201d) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions or reports regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base.\nShort seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S. and are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation AC (Regulation Analyst Certification) and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attack, often times we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law (often called \u201cAnti-SLAPP statutes\u201d), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy - oftentimes blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements - should we be targeted for such an attack, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price should the rumors created not be dismissed by market participants.", "PERMNO": 92589, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "KNDI"}
