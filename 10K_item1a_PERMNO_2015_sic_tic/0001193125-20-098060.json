{"cik": "1525769", "company": "Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. In addition to the information contained elsewhere in this report and other filings that we make with the SEC, the risk factors described below could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows or the trading price of our common stock. It is not possible to identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nCOVID-19 has had an adverse effect that is material on our business and may continue to do so.\nDuring March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the rapidly growing coronavirus outbreak to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States. Federal, state and local governments took a variety of actions to contain the spread of COVID-19. Many jurisdictions where our stores are located required mandatory store closures or imposed capacity limitations and other restrictions affecting our operations. As of March 20, 2020, all of our 137 operating stores were temporarily closed, including our newest store that opened on March 16, 2020. These developments have caused a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business continuity team also led our crisis response efforts to ensure continuity of operations as we closed stores and the corporate office. We reduced expenses broadly, including by furloughing nearly all of workforce except a small team of essential personnel, reducing pay and benefits for remaining employees, cutting back capital spending, and halting all planned store openings. We also suspended our share repurchase program and our dividend, and fully drew down the remaining credit available under our $500,000 revolving credit facility as of the date of this filing.\nWe cannot predict how soon we will be able to reopen our stores and, as, our ability to reopen will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our stores, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses. Considering the significant uncertainty as to when we can reopen some or all of our stores and the uncertain customer demand environment, in addition to the actions described above, we:\n\u2022 have begun discussions with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions;\n\u2022 are in discussion with our lenders to obtain covenant relief to avoid events of default; and\n\u2022 are in active dialogue with multiple potential investors to secure additional sources of financing.\nWhile our lenders have granted a waiver of any event of default associated with receiving an auditor\u2019s report indicating a substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our year-end audit, and some landlords and business partners have agreed to certain concessions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining all of the relief we are seeking. Failure to obtain such a waiver would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and may result in filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring plan. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s ability to generate profitability and cash flows, and uncertainty regarding the length of the disruption may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on our ability to have sufficient liquidity until such time as our stores can again generate revenue and profits capable of supporting our ongoing operations, all of which remain highly uncertain at this time.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial statements contain a statement regarding a substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\nOur audited financial statements as of and for the year ended February 2, 2020 were prepared on the assumption that we would continue as a going concern. As a result of the factors described above under \u201cCOVID-19 has had an adverse effect that is material on our business and may continue to do so,\u201d our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent auditors have included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 2, 2020. Assuming we are able to obtain financial covenant waivers from our lenders (as to which there currently is no assurance), our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months will depend upon a series of factors, including the duration of our store shutdowns; the speed with which, and the extent to which, customers return to our stores once they open; our success in obtaining rent and other concessions from our landlords; and our ability to raise additional capital.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 increase gross sales and operating profits at our existing stores with game, food and beverage options desired by our customers;\n\u2022 evolve our marketing and branding strategies to appeal to our customers;\n\u2022 innovate and implement technology initiatives to provide a unique digital customer experience;\n\u2022 identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including new store openings, remodeling existing stores and new game development;\n\u2022 grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable sites for new stores; and\n\u2022 improve the speed and quality of our service.\nThe success of our growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new stores profitably.\nOur ability to timely and efficiently open new stores and to operate these stores on a profitable basis is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to:\n\u2022 find quality locations;\n\u2022 reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations;\n\u2022 comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations;\n\u2022 raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u2022 timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022 obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor and amusement licenses;\n\u2022 efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new store;\n\u2022 in new markets in which we open, attract customers who may be unfamiliar with our stores or concept or may have different consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing stores;\n\u2022 open a new store in an existing market without significantly reducing revenues at our existing stores; and\n\u2022 meet or exceed our performance targets, including target cash-on-cash\nreturns.\nThe timing of new store openings may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly performance. We typically incur most cash pre-opening\ncosts for a new store within the two months immediately preceding, and the month of, the store\u2019s opening. In addition, the labor and operating costs for a newly opened store during the first three to six months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Additionally, a portion of a current fiscal year new store capital expenditures is related to stores that are not expected to open until the following fiscal year. Due to these substantial up-front\nfinancial requirements to open new stores, the investment risk related to any single store is much larger than that associated with many other restaurants or entertainment venues.\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive out-of-home\nand home-based entertainment and restaurant markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe out-of-home\nentertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers\u2019 discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home\nentertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theatres, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of stores, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our stores are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to our stores. The legalization of casino gambling in geographic areas near any current or future store and the expanded availability of online sports betting would create the possibility for entertainment alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer similar entertainment experiences to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. Our failure to compete favorably in the competitive out-of-home\nand home-based entertainment and restaurant markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInformation technology system failures or interruptions may impact our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely heavily on various information technology systems, including point-of-sale,\nkiosk and amusement operations systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Some of these systems have been internally developed or we rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Although we have operational safeguards in place, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power outages, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations. We rely on third-party service providers for certain key elements of our operations including credit card processing, telecommunications and utilities. Our reliance on systems operated by third parties also present the risk faced by the third party\u2019s business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to timely recover, we could experience an interruption in our operations.\nCyber security breaches or other privacy or data security incidents that expose confidential customer, personal employee or other material, confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf may impact our business.\nA cyber incident generally refers to any intentional attack or an unintentional event that results in unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal or expose confidential information or intellectual property. Many of our information technology systems (and those of our third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for point-of-sale,\nweb and mobile platforms, mobile payment systems and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and initiatives. A cyber incident that compromises the information of our customers or employees could result in widespread negative publicity, damage to our reputation, a loss of customers, and disruption of our business.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements can be costly and time-consuming and the costs could adversely impact our results of operations due to necessary system changes and the development of new administrative processes. The California Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information about California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. We are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard compliance\nat our corporate office and stores. If we do not maintain the required level of PCI compliance, we could be subject to costly fines or additional fees from the card brands that we accept or lose our ability to accept those payment cards. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information.\nOur existing cyber security policy includes cyber security techniques, tactics and procedures, including continuous monitoring and detection programs, network protections, employee training and awareness and incident response preparedness. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our security measures. We began utilizing a voluntary tool to help manage privacy risk by independently benchmarking our cyber security program to a national framework, which provides privacy protection strategies to organizations, like us, looking to improve their approach to using and protecting personal data. Although we employ security technologies and practices and have taken other steps to try to prevent a breach, there are no assurances that such measures will prevent or detect cyber security breaches, and we may nevertheless not have the resources or technical sophistication to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. We maintain a separate insurance policy covering cybersecurity risks and such insurance coverage may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, but this policy is subject to a retention amount and may not be applicable to a particular incident or otherwise may be insufficient to cover all our losses beyond any retention. Further, considering recent court rulings, there is uncertainty as to whether traditional commercial general liability policies will be construed to cover the expenses related to cyberattacks and breaches if credit and debit card information is stolen.\nWe have been and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. In fiscal 2007, there was an external breach of our credit card processing systems, which led to fraudulent credit card activity and resulted in the payment of fines and reimbursements for the fraudulent credit card activity. As part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, we have implemented a series of corrective measures in order to ensure that our computer systems are secure and that our customers\u2019 personal information is protected. If in the future, we experience another security breach, we could become subject to claims, lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft of credit or debit card information, compromised security and information systems, failure of our employees to comply with applicable laws, the unauthorized acquisition or use of such information by third parties, or other similar claims. In addition, such breach could put us in violation of our settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.\nChanges in consumer preferences and buying patterns could negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe success of our stores depends in large part on leased locations. Our locations are primarily located near high density retail areas such as regional malls, lifestyle centers, big box shopping centers and entertainment centers. We depend on a high volume of visitors at these centers to attract customers to our locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may or may not continue to be attractive or profitable. E-commerce\nor online shopping continues to increase and negatively impact consumer traffic at traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, big box shopping centers and entertainment centers. A decline in development or closures of businesses in these settings or a decline in visitors to retail areas near our locations could negatively affect our sales. In addition, desirable locations for the relocation of existing locations may not be available at an acceptable cost, due in part, to the inability to easily terminate a long-term lease.\nConsumers have continually changing health or dietary preferences. As a result, we are challenged to evolve our food and beverage menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences, while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional, allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns, whether issued by governmental agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our store. Additionally, it is unclear currently if the COVID-19\npandemic may have a lasting impact on consumer demand. If we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAdvances in technologies or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by such technologies could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. As part of our marketing efforts, we use a variety of digital platforms including search engines, mobile, online videos and social media platforms such as Facebook\u00ae\n, Twitter\u00ae\nand Instagram\u00ae\nto attract and retain customers. We also test new technology platforms to improve our level of digital engagement with our customers and employees to help strengthen our marketing and related consumer analytics capabilities. These initiatives may not prove to be successful and may result in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased engagement.\nUnfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our business.\nOur brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perception of our Company, the quality of our food service and facilities and our integrity. Multi-store businesses, such as ours, can be adversely affected by unfavorable publicity resulting from poor food quality, food safety concerns, flu or other virus outbreaks and other public health concerns stemming from one or a limited number of our stores. Negative publicity may also\nresult from crime incidents, data privacy breaches, scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our stores. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity related to one or more of our stores could affect public perception of the entire brand. Even incidents at similar businesses such as restaurants, at our competitors, or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that would indirectly harm our brand. If one or more of our stores were the subject of unfavorable publicity and we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, our overall brand could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere has been a significant increase in the use of social media and similar platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites and other forms of Internet-based communications which allow individuals\u2019 access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning goods and services that they have or plan to purchase and may act on such information without further investigation or authentication. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participant\u2019s post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Inaccurate or adverse information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also may be used for dissemination of trade secret information, compromising valuable company assets. In summary, the dissemination of information via social media and similar platforms may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nIf we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. Consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products, which would likely result in lower revenues.\nOur operations are susceptible to the changes in cost and availability of commodities and other products, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity and other product costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation and monetary policy, product availability, recalls of food products, disruption of our supplier manufacturing and distribution processes due to health pandemics, and seasonality, may affect our commodity costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain. In an effort to mitigate some of this risk, we have multiple short-term supply contracts with a limited number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers do not perform adequately or otherwise fail to distribute products or supplies to our stores, we may be unable to replace the suppliers in a short period of time on acceptable terms, which could increase our costs, cause shortages of food and other items at our stores and cause us to remove certain items from our menu. Changes in the price or availability of commodities for which we do not have short-term supply contracts could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Expiring contracts with our food suppliers could also result in unfavorable renewal terms and therefore increase costs associated with these suppliers or may necessitate negotiations with other suppliers. Other than short-term supply contracts for certain food items, we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations in the cost of food and other supplies. Also, the unplanned loss of a major distributor could adversely affect our business by disrupting our operations as we seek out and negotiate a new distribution contract. Further, a significant percentage of our WIN! merchandise inventory is directly or indirectly sourced outside the United States and changes in trade policy and tariffs could negatively impact our costs. If we have to pay higher prices for food or other product costs, our operating costs may increase, and, if we are unable to adjust our purchasing practices or pass any cost increases on to our customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur procurement of new games and amusement offerings is contingent upon availability, and in some instances, our ability to obtain licensing rights.\nOur ability to continue to procure new games, amusement offerings, and other entertainment-related equipment is important to our business strategy. The number of suppliers from which we can purchase games, amusement offerings and other entertainment-related equipment is limited. To the extent that the number of suppliers declines, we could be subject to the risk of distribution delays, pricing pressure, lack of innovation and other associated risks. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing amusement offerings cost by adjusting purchasing practices or game prices, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any decrease in availability of new amusement offerings that appeal to customers could lead to decreases in revenues as customers negatively react to lack of new game options.\nWe have successfully developed several proprietary amusement offerings that are not available to operations outside the Company. Our ability to develop future offerings is dependent on, among other things, obtaining rights to compelling game content and developing new amusement offerings that are accepted by our customers. There is no guarantee that additional licensing rights will be obtained by us or that our customers will accept the future offerings that we develop. The result could be increased expenses without increased revenues putting downward pressure on our results of operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term, non-cancelable\nleases.\nWe typically do not own any real property. Payments under our non-cancelable,\noperating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and we expect the new stores we open in the future will also be leased. The leases typically provide for a base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the revenue generated by the stores on the leased premises once certain thresholds are met. We generally cannot cancel these leases without substantial economic penalty. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligation under the applicable lease, including, among other things, paying the base rent for the remainder of the lease term. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations. If our business does not generate adequate cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our existing credit facility, we may not be able to service our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, as each of our leases expires, we may choose not to renew, or may not be able to renew, such existing leases if the capital investment required to maintain the stores at the leased locations is not justified by the return required on the investment. If we are not able to renew the leases at rents that allow such stores to remain profitable as their terms expire, the number of such stores may decrease, resulting in lower revenue from operations, or we may relocate a store, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified store management and operating personnel while also controlling our labor costs.\nWe must continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified management and operating personnel to maintain consistency in our service, hospitality, quality and atmosphere of our stores, in the United States and Canada and support future growth. Adequate staffing of qualified personnel is a critical factor impacting our customers\u2019 experience in our stores. Qualified management and operating personnel are typically in high demand. The low level of unemployment in the United States is resulting in aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive. If we are unable to attract and retain a satisfactory number of qualified management and operating personnel, labor shortages could delay the planned openings of new stores or adversely impact our existing stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates in existing stores or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur financial performance and the ability to successfully implement our strategic direction could be adversely affected if we fail to retain, or effectively respond, to a loss of key management.\nOur future success is substantially supported by the contributions and abilities of senior management, including key executives and other leadership team members. Changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets. Although we have employment agreements with all members of senior management, we cannot prevent members of senior management from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of members of senior management could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due to various risks and unforeseen circumstances, including increases in costs, seasonality, weather, acts of violence or terrorism and other factors outside our control.\nCertain of the regions in which our stores are located have been, and may in the future be, subject to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Depending upon its magnitude, a natural disaster could severely damage our stores, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our corporate headquarters, company-owned distribution center, game repair facility and our data center, as well as our backup data facility, are all located in Dallas, Texas. A natural or man-made\ndisaster could significantly impact our ability to provide services and systems to our stores and negatively impact store operations throughout our operations. We currently maintain property and business interruption insurance through the aggregate property policy for each of our stores.\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our stores or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our stores and/or store closures in the short-term and, in the long term, may cause our customers and employees to avoid visiting our stores. Any such situation could adversely impact cash flows and make it more difficult to fully staff our stores, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end\nholidays. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school\nfall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. As a result, factors affecting peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our results. For example, the number of days between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Day and the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve fall affect the volume of business we generate during the December holiday season and can affect our results for the full fiscal year. In addition, unfavorable weather conditions during the winter and spring seasons could have a significant impact on our results.\nGeneral Business and Regulatory Risks\nActual or threatened other epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or other health crises may adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).\nTo the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our customers to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers could become infected or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places or avoid touching game or screen surfaces, any of which could adversely affect our store guest traffic and sales as well as our ability to adequately staff our stores, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We could also be adversely affected if the World Health Organization and /or the Centers for Disease Control and/or other governmental agencies were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products, thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply. Additionally, certain jurisdictions in which we operate may impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if our stores are not directly impacted, a health pandemic can result in a disruption of our supply chain if our suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture, transport or otherwise provide goods or services are adversely affected. Additionally, even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our stores have a larger guest-facing footprint and higher levels of customer traffic than other concepts in the dining and entertainment industry. Our stores are places where people can gather together for human connection. Customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. The impact of a health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other dining and entertainment venues that have lower customer traffic and that depend less on the gathering of people.\nWe may not be able to operate our stores or obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary for such operation, in compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages, health, sanitation, safety, building and fire codes. Each store is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one store may lead to the loss of licenses at all stores in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each store, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses, permits and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing store, or delay or prevent the opening of a new store. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, the failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on operations and our ability to obtain such a license or permit in other locations.\nWe are also subject to amusement licensing and regulation by the states, counties and municipalities in which our stores are located, as a result of operating certain entertainment games and attractions, including skill-based games, that offer redemption prizes. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by state, county, and municipality and, in some jurisdictions, may require us to modify our business operations or alter the mix of redemption games and simulators we offer. Moreover, as more states and local communities implement legalized gambling, the laws and corresponding enabling regulations may also be applicable to our redemption games and regulators may create new licensing requirements, taxes or fees, or restrictions on the various types of redemption games we offer. Furthermore, other states, counties and municipalities may make changes to existing laws to further regulate legalized gaming and illegal gambling. Adoption of these laws, or adverse interpretation of existing laws, could require our existing stores in these jurisdictions to alter the mix of games, modify certain games, limit the number of tickets that may be won by a customer from a redemption game, change the mix of prizes that we may offer at our WIN! area or terminate the use of specific games, any of which could adversely affect our operations. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions and/or penalties and fines or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations and failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our operational efficiencies, cost structure and talent availability.\nCurrently, all of our stores are unable to operate due to guidelines and restrictions put in place by federal, state and local governments in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business, including the following:\n\u2022 the Fair Labor Standards Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern employment practices and working conditions, including minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, gratuities, overtime, various family leave mandates, discrimination and harassment, immigration, workplace safety and other areas;\n\u2022 the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas;\n\u2022 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and uncertainties surrounding future changes to or replacement of our health insurance system;\n\u2022 preparation, sale and labeling of food, including the federal regulations of the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the safety of the entire food system, including inspection and mandatory food recalls, menu labeling and nutritional content, and additional requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions;\n\u2022 environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances; and\n\u2022 other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases, water consumption and animal health and welfare;\nCompliance with these laws and regulations and future new laws or changes in these laws or regulations that impose additional requirements, can be costly. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required license, administrative enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal liability, and/or closure of stores. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties. Additionally, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in certain locations.\nIf new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees. Also, although our hiring practices comply with the requirements of federal law in reviewing employees\u2019 citizenship or authority to work in the United States, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our stores, thereby negatively impacting our business.\nFurther, we expect continued increases in labor costs due to federal, state and local mandated increases in the minimum wage, and we are uncertain of the repercussions, if any, of increased minimum wages on other expenses. For example, our suppliers may be more severely impacted by higher minimum wage standards, which could result in increased costs to us. We may not be able to partially or fully offset cost increases resulting from changes in minimum wage rates by increasing menu or game prices, improving productivity, or through other adjustments, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, although none of our employees have been or are now represented by any unions, labor organizations may seek to represent certain of our employees in the future, and if they are successful, our payroll expenses and other labor costs may be increased in the course of collective bargaining, and/or there may be strikes or other work disruptions that may adversely affect our business.\nWe face potential liability with our gift cards under the property laws of some states.\nOur gift cards, which may be used to purchase food, beverages, merchandise and game play credits in our stores, may be considered stored value cards. Certain states include gift cards under their abandoned and unclaimed property laws and require companies to remit to the state cash in an amount equal to all or a designated portion of the unredeemed balance on the gift cards based on certain card attributes and the length of time that the cards are inactive. To date we have not remitted any amounts relating to unredeemed gift cards to states based upon our assessment of applicable laws.\nThe analysis of the potential application of the abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards is complex, involving an analysis of constitutional, statutory provisions and factual issues. In the event that one or more states change their existing abandoned and unclaimed property laws or successfully challenge our position on the application of its abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards, our liabilities with respect to unredeemed gift cards may be materially higher than the amounts shown in our financial statements. If we are required to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements with respect to unredeemed gift cards, our net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Power Cards may raise similar concerns to gift cards in terms of the applicability of state abandoned and unclaimed property laws. However, based on our analysis of abandoned and unclaimed property laws, we believe that our Power Cards are not stored value cards and such laws do not apply, although there can be no assurance that states will not take a different position.\nLitigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the risk of legal proceedings brought by or on behalf of our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies, including ours, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We have had from time to time and now have such lawsuits pending against us. In addition, from time to time, customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a store. We are also subject to a variety of other claims in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury, lease and contract claims.\nWe are also subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes in certain states in which our stores are located. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Also, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially affect our stores and us.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our intellectual property as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We use a combination of intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and trade secrets, to protect our brand and certain other proprietary processes and information material to our business. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our intellectual property rights to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete. If third parties misappropriate or infringe our intellectual property, the value of our image, brand and the goodwill associated therewith may be diminished, our brand may fail to achieve and maintain market recognition, and our competitive position may be harmed, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our revenues. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the violation or misappropriation of such intellectual property rights by others. To protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management and adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our products and services do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, take a royalty-bearing license, discontinue the use of third-party products used within our operations and/or rebrand our products and services.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, including such a failure by third party service providers on whose controls we rely, could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could result in substantial cost to remediate and could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock.\nChanges in tax laws and resulting regulations could result in changes to our tax provisions and subject us to additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use and other taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect and changes to state tax laws that may occur in response to the Tax Act, could affect our effective income tax rate. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax expense or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulation, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny future changes in financial accounting standards may significantly change our reported results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nAdditionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters may significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation contain estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us may significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nWe may acquire a business in the future that we fail to effectively integrate or operate.\nIn the future, we may consider opportunistic acquisitions as part of our expansion effort. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets on terms favorable to us. Competition for acquisition opportunities may be substantial and may cause us to refrain from making acquisitions. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties, diminished financial performance or our inability to report financial results and may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention. If we fail to manage future acquisitions effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions, including:\n\u2022 incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized from acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022 failure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022 potential lack of experience operating in a geographic market or product line of the acquired business;\n\u2022 an increase in our expenses, particularly overhead expenses, and working capital requirements;\n\u2022 the possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the business combination; and\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations, changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant and other entertainment industries, and announcement of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant and other entertainment industries. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price for our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nDuring March 2020, the coronavirus global pandemic and the significant uncertainties in the United States economy created as a result of the health crisis had a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management, including, among other things:\n\u2022 restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022 our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022 the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only upon the request of a majority of our Board of Directors or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022 the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nEffective March 18, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a 364-day\nduration Shareholder Rights Plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock to shareholder of record on March 30, 2020 to purchase from the Company one one-ten\nthousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company for an exercise price of $45.00, once the rights become exercisable, subject to adjustment as provided in the related rights agreement. The Rights Plan is intended to promote the fair and equal treatment of all the Company\u2019s shareholders and ensure that no person or group can gain control of the Company through open market accumulation or other tactics potentially disadvantaging the interest of all shareholders.\nUnsolicited takeover proposals, governance change proposals, proxy contests and certain proposals/actions by activist investors may create additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the Company\u2019s financial position, operations, strategies and management, and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Any perceived uncertainties may affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nPublic companies in the restaurant industry have been the target of unsolicited takeover proposals in the past. In the event that a third party, such as a competitor, private equity firm or activist investor makes an unsolicited takeover proposal, or proposes to change our governance policies or board of directors, or makes other proposals concerning the Company\u2019s ownership structure or operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may be a significant distraction for our management and employees, and may require us to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may create uncertainty for our employees\u2019 additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the Company\u2019s financial position, operations, strategies and management, and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also may affect the market price and volatility of our securities.", "PERMNO": 81695, "SIC": 5810, "TIC": "PLAY"}
