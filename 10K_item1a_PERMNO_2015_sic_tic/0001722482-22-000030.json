Risk factors\nRisks related to our business and our industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, the nature and extent of which could be material.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies, financial markets and the overall environment in which we do business, and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. Many countries including the United States implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. These measures resulted in significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our offerings. We experienced, and may again experience, a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain elements of our businesses, including our education & government and healthcare customer groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our supply\nchain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain raw materials used in the products we manufacture and in the finished goods that we sell globally. It is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist, worsen or re-emerge over an extended period of time. Moreover, any actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have a material, adverse impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nFurther, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products, we have been required to allocate certain products (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations and financial results, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships.\nDue to changes in COVID-19 infection rates regionally, nationally and globally, rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and economic disruption and the duration of the foregoing, the potential impact that COVID-19 could have on the other Risk Factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section remains unclear.\nWe refer you to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date.\nSignificant interruptions in our operations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing, distribution, service and logistics problems can and do arise, and any such problems could have a significant impact on our operating results. Accordingly, any significant disruptions to the operations of our manufacturing or distribution centers or logistics providers for any reason, including labor relations issues, power interruptions, severe weather, fire or other circumstances beyond our control could cause our operating expenses to increase without coverage or compensation or seriously harm our ability to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders or deliver products on a timely basis, or both. We must also maintain sufficient production capacity in order to meet anticipated customer demand, which carries fixed costs that we may not be able to offset if orders slow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. If we are unable to manufacture our products consistently, in sufficient quantities, and on a timely basis, our net sales, gross margins and our other operating results will be materially and adversely affected. Prompt shipment of our products is also very important to our business. We have experienced problems, both as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise with or delays in, our production, shipping and logistics capabilities that resulted in delays in our ability to ship finished products, and there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the future. If we experience significant delays in our manufacturing, shipping or logistics processes, we could damage our customer relationships, cause disruption to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets. Failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition across our products and the markets in which we operate. We compete on several fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, supply chain control, price, value and speed. Our competitors range from regional companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers\u2019 needs because of geographic proximity, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational and research and development resources than we do. Such greater resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies.\nIn addition, consolidation trends in the biopharma and healthcare industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressures. The entry into the market by manufacturers in low-cost manufacturing locations also creates increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets, which may impede our goal to grow in those markets. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors\u2019 actions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving growth.\nWe plan to continue expanding our commercial sales operations and scope and complexity of our business both domestically and internationally, while maintaining our commercial operations and administrative activities. For example, we intend to pursue the following growth strategies: (i) increase integration of our products and services into customers\u2019 workflows; (ii) develop new products and services; (iii) expand in geographies expected to have outsized growth; (iv) continue to enhance our global online platform; (v) increase commercial excellence and operational efficiency to drive margin expansion; and (vi) pursue strategic acquisitions to expand our platform. However, our ability to manage our business and conduct our global operations while also pursuing the aforementioned growth strategies requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures and customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems and commercial markets.\nOur failure to implement these strategies in a cost-effective and timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions, which will subject us to a variety of risks that could harm our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to review, pursue and complete selective acquisition opportunities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete suitable acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the identification of, and competition for, acquisition targets, the need for regulatory approvals, the inability of the parties to agree to the structure or purchase price of the transaction and the inability to finance the transaction on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, any completed acquisition will subject us to a variety of other risks, including:\n\u2022acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future suppliers and other business partners, in particular, to the extent we consummate acquisitions that vertically integrate portions of our business;\n\u2022we may assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities, known and unknown, including environmental liabilities;\n\u2022acquisitions may not meet our expectations of future financial performance;\n\u2022we may experience delays or reductions in realizing expected synergies;\n\u2022we may incur substantial unanticipated costs or encounter other problems associated with acquired businesses or devote time and capital investigating a potential acquisition and not complete the transaction;\n\u2022we may be unable to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction; and\n\u2022we may not be able to retain the key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired business.\nThese factors related to our acquisition strategy, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe customers we serve have and will continue to experience significant industry-related changes that could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the customers we serve have experienced significant industry-related changes in the last several years and are expected to continue to experience significant changes, including reductions in governmental payments for biopharmaceutical products, expirations of significant patents, adverse changes in legislation or regulations regarding the delivery or pricing of general healthcare services or mandated benefits, and increased requirements on quality. General industry changes include:\n\u2022development of large and sophisticated group purchasing organizations and on-line auction sites that increase competition for, and reduce spending on, laboratory products;\n\u2022consolidation of biopharmaceutical companies resulting in a rationalization of research expenditures;\n\u2022increased regulatory scrutiny over drug production requiring safer raw materials;\n\u2022customers\u2019 purchasing the products that we supply directly from our suppliers; and\n\u2022significant reductions in development and production activities.\nSome of our customers have implemented, or may in the future implement, certain measures described above in an effort to control and reduce costs. The ability of our customers to develop new products to replace sales decreases attributable to expirations of significant patents, along with the impact of other past or potential future changes in the industries we serve, may result in our customers significantly reducing their purchases of products from us or the prices they are willing to pay for those products. While we believe we are able to adapt our business to maintain existing customer relationships and develop new customer relationships, if we are unsuccessful or untimely in these efforts, our results of operations may suffer.\nOur offerings are highly complex, and, if our products do not satisfy applicable quality criteria, specifications and performance standards, we could experience lost sales, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nThe high-purity materials and customized solutions we offer are highly exacting and complex due to demanding customer specifications and stringent regulatory and industry requirements. Our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our global quality control systems, including our ability to effectively train and maintain our employees with respect to quality control. A failure of our global quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of defective or non-compliant products. Nearly all of our products are subsequently incorporated into products sold to end users by our customers, and we have no control over the manufacture and production of such products.\nOur success depends on our customers\u2019 confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality products. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products and technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected or fail to meet applicable quality criteria, specifications or performance standards. If our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of net sales, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, and increased insurance or warranty costs, any of which could harm our business.\nThe loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in orders from a significant number of customers could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\nOur operating results could be negatively affected by the loss of revenue from a significant number of our customers, including direct distributors and end users. Though we often include pricing and volume incentives in our contracts, our customers are generally not obligated to purchase any fixed quantities of products, and they may stop placing orders with us at any time. If a significant number of customers purchase fewer of our products, defer orders or fail to place additional orders with us, our sales could decline, and our operating results may not meet our expectations. In addition, if those customers order our products, but fail to pay on time or at all, our liquidity and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to changes in demand from our customers, and these changes have been material in the past. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary for a number of reasons, including individual customer strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of raw materials with which to manufacture our products or insufficient capacity in our sites. Alternatively, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity. Either of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, which may harm our business.\nWe have global operations and derive a portion of our net sales from customers outside of the United States. Accordingly, our international operations or those of our international customers could be substantially affected by a number of risks arising from operating an international business, including:\n\u2022limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022taxes on imports;\n\u2022the possibility that unfriendly nations or groups could boycott our products;\n\u2022general economic and political conditions in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022potential changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union;\n\u2022potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u2022potential increased reliance on third parties within less developed markets;\n\u2022potential trade restrictions, tariffs and exchange controls;\n\u2022more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022the risk that certain governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including nationalization of private enterprise;\n\u2022violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA;\n\u2022violations of economic sanctions laws, such as the regulations enforced by OFAC;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries, whether due to cultural differences, exchange rate fluctuation or other factors;\n\u2022the credit risk of local customers and distributors;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or partners outside of the United States;\n\u2022import and export licensing requirements and other restrictions, such as those imposed by OFAC, BIS, DDTC and comparable regulatory agencies and policies of foreign governments; and\n\u2022changes to our distribution networks.\nChanges in exchange rates can adversely affect our net sales, profits and cash flows.\nA substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside of the United States. in the future. The\nrevenues we report with respect to our operations outside of the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFurther, we have a substantial amount of Euro denominated indebtedness. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Euros may have a material adverse effect on our ability to repay such indebtedness. See Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\u201d\nOur business depends on our ability to use and access information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems to handle our changing needs could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on standardized procedures and multiple information systems, including our online customer portal and distribution and enterprise resource systems, for our operations, customer service and quality and safety procedures. Furthermore, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect electronic information, including confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business information. Through our online customer portal, we collect and store confidential information that customers provide in order to, among other things, purchase products and services and register on our website.\nWe utilize commercially available third-party technology solutions, software and software systems with some proprietary configurations. We also store data using third-party cloud services. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, hackers and other security issues as well as human error. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience a loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. A compromise of our information systems or those with which we interact could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe GDPR, which went into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018, applies to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information of residents of countries in the European Economic Area. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, including but not limited to privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions within the EU or elsewhere, could: result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change our business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries, incur substantial costs (even if we ultimately prevail) or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses as a result.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our proprietary technology and products. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining\npatent or maintaining trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products and processes through development and to the market.\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot enforce our intellectual property rights. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement for business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.\nOur trademarks are valuable assets and if we are unable to protect them from infringement, our business prospects may be harmed.\nOur brands, particularly our J.T.Baker, NuSil, VWR and Masterflex brands, are valuable assets. Therefore, we actively manage our trademark portfolio, including by maintaining registrations for long-standing trademarks and applying to obtain trademark registrations for new brands. We also police our trademark portfolio against infringement. Our efforts to protect and defend our trademarks may fall short or be unsuccessful against competitors or other third parties for a variety of reasons. To the extent that third parties or distributors sell products that are counterfeit versions of our branded products, our customers could inadvertently purchase products that are inferior. This could cause our customers to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales.\nWe are subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business involves risk of product liability, intellectual property claims and other claims in the ordinary course of business arising from the products that we source from various manufacturers or produce ourselves. Furthermore, there may be product liability risks that are unknown or which become known in the future. Substantial, complex or extended litigation on any claim could cause us to incur significant costs and distract our management. We maintain insurance policies and in some cases, our suppliers, customers and predecessors of acquired companies have indemnified us against certain claims. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage or indemnification agreements will be available in all pending or any future cases brought against us. Accordingly, we could be subject to uninsured and unindemnified future liabilities requiring us to provide additional reserves to address such liabilities. An unfavorable result in a case for which adequate insurance or indemnification is not available could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.\nWe sell our products in industries that are characterized by significant technological changes, frequent new product and technology introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our customers\u2019 needs are rapidly evolving. If we do not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies, our offerings may become less desirable in the markets we serve, and our customers could move to new technologies offered by our competitors or make products themselves. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our offerings will likely become less competitive over time, in which case, our competitive position, net sales and operating results could\nsuffer. Accordingly, we focus significant efforts and resources on the development and identification of new technologies, products and services that are attractive to, and gain acceptance, in the markets we serve and further broaden our offerings. To the extent we fail to timely introduce new and innovative products or services, adequately predict our customers\u2019 needs or fail to obtain desired levels of market acceptance, our business may suffer.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon the availability of raw materials.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to obtain high-quality raw materials meeting our specifications and other requirements at reasonable prices, including various active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, compounds, excipients and other raw materials, many of which are sole-sourced due to market or customer demands. Our ability to maintain an adequate supply of such materials and components could be impacted by the availability and price of those raw materials and maintaining relationships with key suppliers.\nMoreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide materials and components that meet our specifications, quality standards, other applicable criteria, and delivery schedules. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to provide expected raw materials or components that meet such criteria could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon maintaining our relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer products from a wide range of suppliers. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of third-party materials & consumables and equipment & instrumentation that we sell, we currently do not manufacture the majority of our products and are dependent on these suppliers for access to those products.\nOur ability to sustain our gross margins has been, and will continue to be, dependent in part upon our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers. These terms may change from time to time, and such changes could adversely affect our gross margins over time. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the acceleration of payment terms to our suppliers and/or the imposition of more restrictive credit terms and other contractual requirements.\nOur use of chemicals and chemical processes is subject to inherent risk.\nWe use chemical ingredients in the manufacture of certain of our products. Due to the nature of the manufacturing process itself, there is a risk of incurring liability for damages caused by or during the storage or manufacture of both the chemical ingredients and the finished products. The processes used in certain of our facilities typically involve large volumes of solvents and chemicals, creating the potential for fires, spills and other safety or environmental impacts. If any of these risks materialize, it could result in significant remediation and other costs, potential adverse regulatory actions and liabilities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the manufacturing, use, storage, and distribution of chemicals are subject to threats including terrorism. We have several high-risk chemical facilities that possess materials that could be stolen and used to make weapons. We could also be subject to an attack on our high-risk facilities that could cause a significant number of deaths and injuries. As a result, many people, including our employees, could be harmed. Such an occurrence could also harm the environment, our reputation and disrupt our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals. Competition for senior management and other key personnel in our industry is intense, and the pool of suitable candidates is limited. The failure to attract, retain and properly motivate members of our senior management team and other key employees, or to find suitable replacements for them in the event of death, illness or their desire to pursue other professional opportunities, could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nThe U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, continue to focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting.\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof, the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected. The impact of the factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period.\nCertain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third parties could fail to perform sufficiently.\nWe believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (i) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (ii) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (iii) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (iv) compete with us; (v) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (vi) have insufficient capital resources; and (vii) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nRisks related to regulation\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies, and our failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in markets in which we and our customers are subject to federal, state, local, international and transnational laws and regulations, including the operating, quality and security standards of the FDA, various state health departments, the DHHS, similar bodies of the EU and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs driven by those regulations. Among other rules affecting us, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cGMP and product safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with, the laws and regulations of the FDA, the DHHS, the DEA, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state health departments and/or comparable state and foreign agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the types of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our products are marketed to the biopharma industry for use in discovering, developing and manufacturing drugs, or are sold as raw materials or components to drug device manufacturers or for use in the manufacture of implantable devices. Changes in the domestic or foreign regulation of drug discovery, development or manufacturing processes or medical device manufacturing processes, or adverse findings concerning any health effects associated with these products, could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and could also result in legal liability and claims.\nWe are also registered with the DDTC, as a manufacturer and exporter of goods controlled by ITAR, and we are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements related to these goods. Our failure to comply with ITAR and other export control laws and regulations, as well as economic sanctions, could result in penalties, loss, or suspension of contracts or other consequences. Any of these could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Failure by us or by our customers to meet one or more of these various regulatory obligations could have adverse consequences in the event of material non-compliance. Compliance with relevant sanctions and export control laws could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times could interrupt our supply of imported inventory or our ability to service certain customers. Conversely, compliance with these regulatory obligations may require us to incur significant expenses.\nIn addition, certain of our facilities are certified to ISO, including ISO 13485, ISO 9001, AS9100, ISO 22000 and/or ISO 14001. These standards are voluntary quality management system standards, the maintenance of which indicates to customers certain quality and operational norms. Customers may rely on contractual assurances that we make with respect to ISO certificates to transact business. Failure to comply with these ISO standards can lead to observations of non-compliance or even suspension of ISO or Aerospace Standard (AS) certifications or European Community (EC) Declarations of Conformity Certificates by the registrar. If we were to lose ISO or AS certifications or EC Declarations of Conformity, we could lose sales and customers to competitors or other suppliers. We are also subject to periodic inspections or audits by our customers. If these audits or inspections identify issues or the customer perceives there are issues, the customer may decide to cease purchasing products from us which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or regulations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the EPA, OSHA and equivalent local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. For example, we recently entered into a settlement with the EPA to resolve alleged violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act at our Phillipsburg, New Jersey and Paris, Kentucky facilities. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations or from past uses of land that we own or operate may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental, health and safety conditions, new regulations, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, business interruptions, compliance costs or penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently incur costs and may incur additional costs related to remediation of alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling at property that we currently own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, or facilities to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation and we may be subject to additional claims for cleanup or other environmental claims in the future based on our past, present or future business activities, and we may not be able to recover any costs under any of our indemnifications that we have. For additional information regarding environmental matters, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt or contractual obligations.\nWe now have and expect to continue to have a significant amount of debt. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us including the following:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt or contractual obligations;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although our credit agreement and indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nAn increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables facility, to the extent the interest rate is not fixed, are at variable rates of interest. An increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense.\nOur total interest expense was $217.4 million in 2021 and $307.6 million in 2020.\nRisks related to ownership of our stock\nOur common stock ranks junior to the MCPS with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs.\nOur common stock ranks junior to the MCPS with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated and unpaid dividends have been declared and paid, or set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of the MCPS for all preceding dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the MCPS a liquidation preference equal to $50.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, including restrictions under our credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock unless accumulated and unpaid dividends on the MCPS have been declared and paid, or set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of the MCPS for all preceding dividend periods.\nAs a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that state and federal courts (as appropriate) located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the state or federal courts (as appropriate) located within the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of our company to us or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) action against us or any of our directors or officers involving a claim or defense arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (iv) action against us or any director or officer of the Company involving a claim or defense implicating the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) action against us or any of our directors or officers involving a claim or defense arising pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. It is possible that these exclusive forum provisions may be challenged in court and may be deemed unenforceable in whole or in part. Our exclusive forum provision shall not relieve the company of its duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and\nregulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18579, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "AVTR"}
