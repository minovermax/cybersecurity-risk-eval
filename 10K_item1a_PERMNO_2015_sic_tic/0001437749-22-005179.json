{"cik": "1010086", "company": "SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events. These forward-looking statements and other information are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results, including the following:\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Government Contracts\nGovernment contracts require ongoing funding decisions by governments. A substantial percentage of our potential contract revenues would come from the 19C BARDA Contract, and the majority of the potential revenue under the 19C BARDA Contract is tied to options which may or may not be exercised at the sole discretion of BARDA. Reduced or discontinued BARDA funding, or the non-exercise of contract options under the 19C BARDA Contract, could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects to suffer materially.\nGovernment-funded contracts typically consist of a base period of performance and options for the performance of certain future activities. The value of goods and services subject to options may constitute the majority of the total value of the underlying contract, as in the case of the 19C BARDA Contract.\nThe funding of government programs, which fund BARDA\u2019s purchases under the 19C BARDA Contract, is subject to Congressional appropriations, generally made on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years. Our government customers are subject to political considerations and budgetary constraints, which result in uncertainties as to continued funding of their ongoing programs, including SIGA\u2019s contracts.\nMore than 90% of remaining contract value of the 19C BARDA Contract is tied to options exercisable in the sole discretion of BARDA. There is no guarantee that any of the remaining options will be exercised, or if they are exercised when such exercise of options will occur. If some of these options are not exercised, because levels of government expenditures and authorizations for biodefense decrease or shift to other programs, or for any other reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer materially.\nGovernment procurement contracts are mostly set at fixed prices determined at inception of the contract based on estimates of the time, resources and expenses required to perform these contracts. If our estimates are not accurate, we may not be able to earn an adequate return or may incur a loss under these arrangements.\nRemaining unexercised options under current government procurement contracts, including the 19C BARDA Contract, are predominately fixed-price. We expect that our future contracts with the U.S. Government and foreign governments for TPOXX\u00ae, as well as contracts for other biodefense product candidates, would also be fixed-price arrangements. Under a fixed-price contract, we are required to deliver our products at a fixed price determined at the inception of the contract regardless of the actual costs we incur, and to absorb any costs incurred in satisfaction of our obligations. Our failure to anticipate significant technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract could reduce the profitability of such contract, or if severe, cause a loss, which could in turn negatively affect our operating results.\nWe expect future operating revenues to come significantly from contracts with BARDA for the provision and maintenance of the U.S. Government\u2019s stockpile of TPOXX\u00ae. If BARDA does not enter into additional contracts after the 19C BARDA Contract to maintain or expand the stockpile of TPOXX\u00ae, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe success of our business and our operating results for the foreseeable future will be substantially dependent on the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to maintaining or expanding its stockpile of TPOXX\u00ae. Failure to secure and perform additional contracts after the 19C BARDA Contract to substantially maintain or expand the stockpile of TPOXX\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, the 19C BARDA Contract does not necessarily increase the likelihood that we will secure future comparable contracts with the U.S. Government.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts and grants might make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\nOur business with the U.S. Government, and any future business with state and local governmental agencies are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other legal and compliance obligations. These laws and rules include those related to procurement integrity, rates and pricing of services and goods to be reimbursed by the U.S. Government, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording and reporting of costs, and foreign corrupt practices. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation and other agency-specific regulations supplemental to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nexport and import control laws and regulations, including laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nCompliance with these obligations increases our performance and compliance costs. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. The termination of a government contract as a result of our failure to satisfy any of these obligations would have a material negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts or grants in the future.\nUnfavorable provisions in government contracts and grants, some of which may be customary, may harm our future business, financial condition and potential operating results.\nGovernment contracts and grants customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including (but not limited to) provisions that allow the government to:\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts or grants, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nunilaterally reduce or modify grants, contracts or subcontracts, including through the use of equitable price adjustments;\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts or grants and related orders if funds for performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\ndecline to exercise an option to renew, or to exercise the maximum amount specified in, a contract or grant;\n\u2022\nexercise an option to purchase only the minimum amount specified in a contract or grant;\n\u2022\nclaim rights to products or assets, including intellectual property, developed under a contract or grant;\n\u2022\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline or higher costs than expected;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar a contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency due to regulatory or compliance failures;\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act and the False Statements Accountability Act; and\n\u2022\ncontrol or prohibit the export of products.\nGenerally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract or grant for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract or grant for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our government contracts and grants, including the 19C BARDA Contract, could be terminated under these circumstances.\nA U.S. Government shutdown could negatively impact our business and liquidity.\nEach year, the U.S. Congress must pass all spending bills in the federal budget. If any such spending bill is not timely passed, a government shutdown may close many federally run operations, and halt work for federal employees unless they are considered essential or such work is separately funded by a continuing resolution or by industry. If a government shutdown were to occur, we could experience a delay in contract funding decisions by the government. Additionally, we could be materially harmed by any prolonged government shutdown.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government.\nU.S. Government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the \u201cDCAA\u201d), routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts and grants, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThe DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any cost found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, a contractor may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, debarment or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. Such actions would also negatively affect our reputation.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approvals\nIf we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for certain additional indications or formulations of TPOXX\u00ae from the FDA, we may not be able to realize the full benefits of any BARDA contracts and may not be able to commercialize such formulations or indications other than through existing sales to BARDA, and our ability to generate future revenue could be materially impaired.\nThe development and full commercialization of additional indications or formulations of TPOXX\u00ae in the U.S., such as the intravenous formulation or indication of use for post-exposure prophylaxis, including the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries and jurisdictions. We could fail to achieve FDA or other regulatory approval of certain indications or formulations of TPOXX\u00ae, or there could be delays in such approval of TPOXX\u00ae, or the approved labeling for such indications or formulations of TPOXX\u00ae may differ from expectations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain indications or formulations for TPOXX\u00ae may prevent us from fully commercializing TPOXX\u00ae in the United States other than through existing sales to BARDA and may impact other regulatory authorities' future review of expanded formulations or indications of TPOXX\u00ae, which in turn, could adversely impact commercializing TPOXX\u00ae in other countries, and such delays or required alterations to regulatory applications could also have a material adverse effect on future revenue opportunities for the Company.\nFailure to obtain future regulatory approval in additional international jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products in certain jurisdictions abroad.\nTo market our products in certain additional foreign jurisdictions, we may need to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and differing manufacturing or labeling requirements. Complying with such requirements may take additional time prior to approval and delay commercial activities in those jurisdictions.\nThe foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval for expanded indications or new formulations of TPOXX\u00ae. We may not obtain additional foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Regulatory approval by the FDA, which we obtained for oral TPOXX\u00ae, or by a foreign regulatory authority such as Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency, which we obtained for oral TPOXX\u00ae, does not ensure approval by future additional regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA for expanded indications or new formulations. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approvals elsewhere. We may not be able to file for or receive necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in additional new markets, in which case, our target market may be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates may be harmed and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercial Activities\nWe cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize TPOXX\u00ae other than the oral formulation for smallpox treatment.\nWe have received FDA approval only for the oral formulation of TPOXX\u00ae in the U.S., not the intravenous or liquid suspension/pediatric formulation, or any other indication beyond treatment for smallpox, for TPOXX\u00ae. Because pharmaceutical manufacturers are only permitted to commercialize indications and formulations that have received FDA approval (or in other jurisdictions according to their applicable regulatory and legal frameworks), any regulatory or legal setbacks as described above could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to sell other formulations or for other uses of TPOXX\u00ae pending such approvals.\nChanging political or social factors and opposition, including protests and potential related litigation, may delay or impair our ability to market TPOXX\u00ae and any other biodefense product candidates and may require us to spend time and money to address these issues.\nProducts developed to treat diseases caused by or to combat the threat of bioterrorism or biowarfare are subject to changing political and social environments. The political and social responses to bioterrorism and biowarfare have been unpredictable and much debated. Changes in the perception of the risk that military personnel or civilians could be exposed to biological agents as weapons of bioterrorism or biowarfare may delay or cause resistance to bringing investigational products to market or limit pricing or purchases of approved products, any of which could materially harm our business.\nLawsuits, protests or other negative publicity may adversely affect the degree of market acceptance of, and thereby limit the demand for, TPOXX\u00ae and our biodefense product candidates. In such event, our ability to market and sell such products may be hindered, the commercial success of TPOXX\u00ae and other products we develop may be harmed and we may need to expend time, attention and resources addressing such legal or publicity issues, thereby reducing our revenues and having a material adverse impact on us.\nOur ability to grow our business may depend in part on our ability to achieve sales of TPOXX\u00ae to customers other than the U.S. and Canadian governments.\nAn element of our business strategy is to sell TPOXX\u00ae internationally to foreign governments, as well as to customers other than the U.S. and Canadian governments. These potential non-U.S. Government customers include foreign governments, as well as state and local governments, non-governmental organizations focused on global health like the World Health Organization, health care institutions like hospitals (domestic and foreign) and certain large business organizations interested in protecting their employees against global threats and protecting first responders in cases of emergencies.\nTo the extent we seek such non-government sales in the U.S., we may need to meet additional regulatory requirements.\nThe market for sales of TPOXX\u00ae to U.S. customers other than the U.S. Government is undeveloped, and we may not be successful in generating meaningful sales of TPOXX\u00ae, if any, to these potential customers.\nIf we fail to increase our sales of TPOXX\u00ae to customers other than the U.S. and Canadian governments, our business and opportunities for growth could be limited.\nWe expect our future international revenues to depend heavily on the success of the efforts of Meridian pursuant to an International Promotion Agreement, which may not be successful.\nPursuant to the International Promotion Agreement described under \u201cBusiness,\u201d we granted a third party, Meridian Medical Technologies (\"Meridian\") exclusive rights to market, advertise, promote, offer for sale, or sell oral TPOXX\u00ae in all geographic regions except for the United States (the \u201cTerritory\u201d), and Meridian agreed not to commercialize any competing product, as defined in the International Promotion Agreement, in the specified field of use in the Territory. Our future international revenues will likely depend heavily on the success of the efforts of Meridian pursuant to the International Promotion Agreement, which may not be successful.\nIf we are unable to expand our internal sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties with expertise in sales and marketing, we may be unable to expand our sales of TPOXX\u00ae or other product candidates in the U.S., including to U.S. customers other than the U.S. Government.\nIn the United States market, we have retained all sales and marketing rights with respect to oral TPOXX\u00ae. In this market, we currently employ a small, targeted group to support development and business activities related to TPOXX\u00ae. We plan to continue our current approach for sales to the U.S. Government of any other biodefense product candidates that we may successfully develop. This approach may prove insufficient to adequately support our development and business activities in the United States.\nIn order to expand our sales of TPOXX\u00ae or other product candidates in the U.S., including to U.S. customers other than the U.S. Government, we may need to enhance our own sales and marketing capabilities, and/or enter into collaborations with third parties able to perform these services or outsource these functions to third parties. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully, and even if we are able to do so that it will have a significant impact on our growth or profitability.\nAlthough TPOXX\u00ae is currently stockpiled only by the U.S. and Canadian governments and not sold commercially, in the future we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of TPOXX\u00ae if we or others identify side effects after we are on the market, which could harm future sales of such product.\nIf we or others identify side effects of any approved product, or if manufacturing problems occur:\n\u2022\nregulatory approval may be withdrawn;\n\u2022\nreformulation of our products, additional clinical trials or other testing or changes in labeling of our products may be required;\n\u2022\nchanges to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities used by SIGA may be required;\n\u2022\nsales of the affected products may drop significantly;\n\u2022\nour reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u2022\nlawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us.\nAny of the above occurrences could harm or prevent future sales of the affected product or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these products.\nIf we sell TPOXX\u00ae to non-government customers and are able to charge such customers higher prices than we charge to the U.S. Government, healthcare reform and controls on healthcare spending in the U.S. may nonetheless limit the prices we charge for our products and the amounts that we can sell.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals in the United States to change the health care system in ways that could affect our pricing of TPOXX\u00ae to non-government customers. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealthcare Reform Act\u201d), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and had a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs like Medicare, reimbursement changes and rules protecting against fraud and abuse, that affect existing healthcare programs. If we are able to charge higher prices to non-government customers than we charge to the U.S. Government, healthcare reform and controls on healthcare spending in the U.S. may nonetheless limit the price we charge for our products and the amounts that we can sell. For example, some of our revenue may be derived from governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare. Furthermore, beginning in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Act imposed a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs,\u201d which includes innovator drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs or generics) to U.S. Government programs. The Healthcare Reform Act and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have an adverse effect on our industry generally, as well as potential future sales and profitability of our current or future products.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations may hinder us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and require us to revise and implement costly compliance programs.\nIn connection with our International Promotion Agreement with Meridian, Meridian serves as the entity that markets and promotes oral TPOXX\u00ae (except in the United States) and is the counterparty to any agreements within covered foreign jurisdictions. As such, Meridian is responsible for anti-corruption compliance related to its activities.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") can result in significant civil and criminal penalties that can be levied on the Company and its executives.\nIndictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. Government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices could have a material negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nOther countries, such as the UK, have anti-bribery laws similar to or more expansive in scope than the FCPA which may be applicable to our operations as we expand outside the U.S.\nWe could incur net losses in the future if options are not exercised under the 19C BARDA Contract.\nWhile we believe our current cash position is strong, our ability to continue to fund future operations will be substantially impacted by cash flows from the 19C BARDA Contract, which may not be sufficient if BARDA elects, in its sole discretion, not to exercise or to significantly delay exercise of some or all of the remaining options under the 19C BARDA Contract. If cash flows from the 19C BARDA Contract are significantly different from expectations, or if operating expenses or other expenses meaningfully exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing, Storage and Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf third parties on whom we rely for manufacturing and raw materials of TPOXX\u00ae, and managing our inventory, do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to successfully satisfy our obligations under the 19C BARDA Contract and our business would suffer.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers and service providers to provide raw materials and manufacture, package, test and ship TPOXX\u00ae. Under the 19C BARDA Contract, we are responsible for the performance of these third-party contractors, and our contracts with these third parties give us certain supervisory and quality control rights, but we do not exercise day-to-day control over their activities.\nAdditionally, we may rely on a third-party provider, or multiple providers, to store or transport a portion of the stockpile of IV TPOXX\u00ae under the 19C BARDA Contract, entrusting such vendor or vendors with the care and handling of a substantial portion of IV TPOXX\u00ae inventory.\nIf a third-party provider fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to conduct trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, experiences shortages or delays, or otherwise does not carry out its contractual duties to us, or encounters physical damage or natural disaster or disruptions at its facilities, for example as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to meet our obligations under the 19C BARDA Contract or to develop, obtain approval of and commercialization of IV TPOXX\u00ae or other drug candidates, could be significantly impaired or delayed. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.\nIf third parties do not manufacture our drug candidates or products in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost or in compliance with regulatory or contractual requirements and specifications, the fulfillment of contractual requirements under the 19C BARDA Contract, or any other procurement contract, or the development of our drug candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nIf our contract manufacturers are unable to generate enough materials to meet commercial obligations or satisfy clinical needs, for example as a result of disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the success of drug products may be jeopardized. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our drug candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop drug candidates and perform on commercial contracts on a timely and competitive basis. If our third-party manufacturers\u2019 production processes malfunction or contaminate our drug supplies during manufacturing, we may incur significant inventory loss that may not be covered by our contractual provisions or insurance policies.\nWe currently rely on third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance, for regulatory and science support and for quality assurance with respect to the drug candidates manufactured for us. We intend to continue to rely on these third parties for these purposes with respect to production of commercial supplies of drugs that we successfully develop. Manufacturers are subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe cannot be certain that our present or future manufacturers will be able to comply with these regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities may not conduct required inspections at our CMO facilities, and without such inspections, drug approvals could be delayed. Our government contracts and grants call for compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, however, we do not control third-party manufacturers and their methods for ensuring adherence to regulatory and legal standards. If we or these third parties fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us which could significantly delay and adversely affect supplies of our drug candidates.\nProblems related to large-scale commercial manufacturing could cause an increase in costs or shortages of products or a delay in product launches.\nManufacturing API and finished drug products, especially in large quantities, is complex. Our products require several manufacturing steps at multiple facilities, and may involve complex techniques to assure quality and sufficient quantity, especially as the manufacturing scale increases. Our products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process. Accordingly, it is essential to be able to validate and control the manufacturing process to assure that it is reproducible. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining materials, filling, labeling, packaging, storage, shipping, quality control and testing, some of which all pharmaceutical companies, including SIGA, experience from time to time, may result in lot failures, delay in the release of lots, product recalls or spoilage. Success rates can vary dramatically at different stages of the manufacturing process, which can lower yields and increase costs. We may experience deviations in the manufacturing process that may take significant time and resources to resolve and, if unresolved, may affect manufacturing output and/or cause us to fail to satisfy contractual commitments, lead to delays in our clinical trials or result in litigation or regulatory action. Such actions would hinder our ability to meet contractual obligations and could cause material adverse consequences for our business.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nGrowth of our business may be impacted significantly by our success in completing development and commercialization of drug candidates, new formulations or additional indications for TPOXX\u00ae. If we are unable to commercialize new drug candidates, new formulations, or additional indications, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a substantial amount of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate near-term cash flows is primarily dependent on the success of our smallpox antiviral drug TPOXX\u00ae, which has only been approved by the FDA in oral form. The commercial success of our current and future drug candidates, new formulations or additional indications for TPOXX\u00ae, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nsuccessful development, formulation and cGMP scale-up of drug manufacturing that meets FDA requirements;\n\u2022\nsuccessful development of animal models;\n\u2022\nsuccessful completion of non-clinical development, including studies in approved animal models;\n\u2022\nour ability to pay the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nsuccessful completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals, including the impact of marketing restrictions or required post-approval clinical studies, from the FDA for IV and liquid suspension/pediatric formulations of TPOXX\u00ae and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nestablishing arrangements on reasonable terms with suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing stable commercial supplies of drug candidates, including availability of raw materials;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product by potential government customers, public health experts, physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nWe may rely on FDA regulations known as the \u201cAnimal Rule\u201d to obtain approval for most of our biodefense drug candidates. The Animal Rule permits the use of animal efficacy studies together with human clinical safety trials to support an application for marketing approval. These regulations are relied upon only occasionally. It is possible that results from these animal efficacy studies may not be predictive of the actual efficacy of our drug candidates in humans. If we are not successful in completing the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, whether due to our efforts or due to concerns raised by our governmental regulators or customers, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to fully commercialize the IV and liquid suspension/pediatric formulation of TPOXX\u00ae, or other additional indications for TPOXX\u00ae, if our clinical trials do not demonstrate adequate safety or our animal studies do not demonstrate adequate efficacy.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our drug candidates, extensive development is required. The goal of development is to use clinical studies to demonstrate the safety of our drug candidates and animal trials to demonstrate the efficacy of our drug candidates. Clinical trials and animal studies, and related work, are resource-intensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials or animal efficacy studies will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial or animal efficacy study do not necessarily predict final results.\nA failure of one or more of our clinical trials or animal efficacy studies can occur at any stage of development. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, pre-clinical testing and the clinical trial or animal efficacy study process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional pre-clinical testing or clinical trials, or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising, if our pre-clinical tests, clinical trials or animal efficacy studies produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe resources required to manage and oversee our clinical trials could escalate and become cost prohibitive;\n\u2022\nour governmental regulators may impose requirements on clinical trials, pre-clinical trials or animal efficacy studies that we cannot meet or that may prohibit or limit our ability to perform or complete the necessary testing in order to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nany regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable;\n\u2022\nwe may not be successful in recruiting a sufficient number of qualifying subjects for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe effects of our drug candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the drug candidates may have other unexpected characteristics; or\n\u2022\nthe required resources, regulations, or challenges associated with animal studies may increase and make our studies more difficult.\nIntravenous and Liquid Suspension/Pediatric TPOXX\u00ae formulations are currently in product development and there can be no assurance of successful development or ultimate commercialization beyond the 19C BARDA Contract.\nThe fact that the FDA has approved the oral formulation of TPOXX\u00ae does not guarantee that our approach to drug development will be effective or will result in the successful commercialization of the IV or liquid suspension/pediatric formulation of TPOXX\u00ae, any new indication such as post-exposure prophylaxis, of TPOXX\u00ae or any other drug. We cannot predict with certainty whether any other drug candidate or expanded indication resulting from our research and development efforts will be approved by the FDA.\nAll of our potential drug candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that our drug candidates will not or cannot:\n\u2022\nbe shown to be safe, non-toxic and effective;\n\u2022\notherwise meet applicable regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nreceive the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndevelop into commercially viable drugs;\n\u2022\nbe manufactured or produced economically and on a large scale;\n\u2022\nbe successfully marketed;\n\u2022\nbe paid for by governmental procurers or be reimbursed by governmental or private insurers; or\n\u2022\nachieve customer acceptance.\nIn addition, third parties may seek to preclude us from marketing our drugs through enforcement of their proprietary or intellectual property rights that we are not aware of, or third parties may succeed in marketing equivalent or superior drug products that do not infringe our intellectual property. Our failure to develop safe, commercially viable future drug candidates or obtain approval for expanded indications and formulations of TPOXX\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business, and impair our financial condition and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may decrease if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory exclusivity, patent and other intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies, drug targets and potential products and to preserve our trade secrets and trademark rights. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing potential products through the development and regulatory clearance processes to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining regulatory, patent and trade secret protection. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents worldwide has emerged to date. Accordingly, we cannot definitively predict the type and breadth of claims allowed in patents covering our products.\nSIGA exclusively owns its key patent portfolios, which relate to its leading drug product, TPOXX\u00ae (also known as ST-246, tecovirimat). As of January 10, 2022, the TPOXX\u00ae patent portfolio has seven patent families consisting of 28 U.S. utility patents, 97 issued foreign patents, two U.S. utility patent applications, and 24 foreign patent applications.\nWith FDA regulatory approval of oral TPOXX\u00ae in July 2018, we were awarded seven years of regulatory exclusivity by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office based on orphan drug designation for the product. Such protection is separate from, and in addition to, our patent and other intellectual property rights and provides for exclusivity to July 2025.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities. In an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants and some collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, confidential information or inventions in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, and adequate remedies may not exist in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf our technologies are alleged or found to infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others, we may be sued, we may have to pay damages or be barred from pursuing a technology, or we may have to license those rights from and pay royalties to others on unfavorable terms. If we are sued, even if we prevail, such litigation may be costly.\nOur commercial success will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Our technologies, or the technologies of third parties on which we may depend, may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. If there is an adverse outcome in any dispute concerning rights to these technologies, then we could be subject to significant liability, required to license disputed rights from or to other parties and/or required to cease using a technology necessary to carry out our research, development and commercialization activities. We do not currently license any patent rights from third parties relative to TPOXX\u00ae.\nIf our patents are challenged and found to be invalid or unenforceable, the value of our products could be harmed, and we could be subject to competition earlier than we anticipated.\nThe costs to establish or defend against claims of infringement or interference with patents or other proprietary rights can be expensive, distracting and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable. An outcome of any patent or proprietary rights administrative proceeding or litigation that is unfavorable to us may cause us to incur significant costs, and have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, we may not prevail in any such action and such litigation often takes years to resolve creating business uncertainty if we are not able to resolve it quickly.\nFurthermore, like many biopharmaceutical companies, we may from time to time hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. It is possible that we and/or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership of our capital stock could delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock (\"principal stockholders\") beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. Additionally, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of SIGA. As of February 16, 2022, directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (excluding institutional investors) beneficially owned approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. In addition to owning common stock of the Company, directors and certain executive officers have the right to acquire additional stock through the exercise or conversion of certain securities.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOn August 2, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2023. This stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or delay the Company\u2019s stock repurchases, without prior notice, and that could in any event impact management\u2019s exercise of its discretion as to the amount and timing of such repurchases, include the timing of exercise of procurement options under government contracts, alternative opportunities for strategic uses of cash, the stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The existence of our stock repurchase program could cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program would diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue other opportunities, further develop our technology or adversely affect our operating results. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases would enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares could negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price.\nA future issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, thereby delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGlobal infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or climate-related matters could negatively impact the global economy on a broad scale and our business in particular.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant societal and economic disruption. Such disruption, and the associated risks and costs, are expected to continue for an indeterminate period of time. Given the uncertain future course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertain scale and scope of its future direct and indirect impact, the Company is continually reviewing business and financial risks related to the pandemic and seeking coordination with its government partners with respect to the performance of current and future government contracts. Additionally, the Company is continually coordinating with service providers and vendors, in particular Contract Manufacturing Organizations that constitute our supply chain, with respect to actions and risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s supply chain for the manufacture of TPOXX\u00ae and for the raw materials and supplies necessary to support manufacture and product delivery activities on future projects, could be materially disrupted by COVID-19. With regard to day-to-day operations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the secondary effects of the pandemic, have at times slowed the daily pace of execution of government contracts as well as new contract generation. For example, U.S. and foreign government staffs overseeing health security preparedness have been involved directly or indirectly in governmental responses to the pandemic, which has diverted government staff time that would normally be directed toward contract matters involving SIGA. The Company expects to experience delays, or a slower than usual pace, in connection with certain research and development activities, such as those that involve clinical trials. While the Company does not currently expect any pandemic-related delays in research and development activities to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or annual financial results of the Company, or its long-term performance, the Company cannot give assurances as to the full extent of the impact at this time.\nOverall, while the COVID-19 pandemic has not adversely affected the liquidity position of the Company, the pandemic has diverted foreign government staff time normally directed toward contract matters involving SIGA and has affected and could continue to affect the timing of international contract awards for oral TPOXX\u00ae. Additionally, although SIGA has completed delivery of TPOXX\u00ae courses covered by the option exercised by the U.S. Government in 2021, the pandemic could result in a slower pace of future product deliveries if the pandemic results in shortages or delays in the receipt by the supply chain of raw materials or supplies. Furthermore, Executive Order 14042 by the President of the United States, which subjects federal prime contractors and subcontractors to certain vaccination requirements and other COVID-19 related safety measures, could have a material impact on the availability and/or timing of services provided to SIGA by certain vendors for supply chain activities and research and development activities. The mandate has been challenged in several cases that are currently pending, and in at least one case a nationwide injunction has barred enforcement of the mandate while the cases are being pursued. The future outcome of such litigation is uncertain, and consequently the scope and enforceability of the underlying vaccine mandate as it applies to federal contractors and subcontracts, is not known at this time. If the general negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more acute, including due to resurgences in infections or lack of vaccination, there could be material adverse effects to our business and cash flows.\nOur business has been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent and nature to which the COVID-19 pandemic, and any related consequences, will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden directed the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or obtain a negative COVID-19 test at least once a week. President Biden also issued an Executive Order requiring certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination (subject to medical and religious exemptions) that directly impacts SIGA given its government contracts. Both mandates were challenged in court. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the vaccine-or-test emergency temporary standard (ETS) that OSHA issued in November 2021. The stay will be in effect until the claims contesting the ETS\u2019 legality that are pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are fully resolved. As a result, employers do not need to comply with the ETS and OSHA cannot enforce it. Although the OSHA ETS is not in effect at this time, employers may be required under other laws to mandate vaccines (subject to accommodation obligations), such as under the federal vaccine mandate for healthcare workers and the New York City Order requiring vaccines. The vaccine mandate for federal contractors and subcontractors is currently not in effect, as it was stayed by a court in December 2021. It is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact on us given the requirements for government contractors and their subcontractors. SIGA does not expect a material impact on the current workforce from any requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of our workforce, however such requirements could result in employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs at our subcontractors, and therefore have an adverse effect on the amount and timing of future profits. In addition, any requirement to impose obligations on our suppliers under the Executive Order covering government contractors and their subcontractors could impact the price and continuity of services provided in connection with the supply chain, commercial activities and research and development activities, which in turn could impact the Company\u2019s performance under government contracts and the amount and timing of future profits.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, materially change the risk profile of the Company and/or adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing businesses. In addition, we may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or consummating any such agreement. Even if we do consummate an acquisition, in connection therewith we may be required to issue equity (thereby diluting our current stockholders) or debt, we may not be able to integrate successfully the acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, or the acquired business could otherwise fail to meet our expectations, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business projections, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe health security markets in which we compete and will compete are highly competitive.\nThe health security industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and apply our technologies in the design and development of our product candidates and to establish and maintain a market for our product candidates. In addition, there are many companies, both public and private, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions engaged in developing pharmaceutical, health security and biotechnology products. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, technical, research and development resources, and human resources than us. Competitors may develop products or other technologies that are more effective than any that are being developed by us or may obtain FDA approval for products more rapidly than us. If we commence commercial sales of products, we still must compete in the manufacturing and marketing of such products, areas in which it is very difficult to succeed and in which we have limited experience and in which we are partially dependent on third parties. Many potential competitors have manufacturing facilities and established marketing capabilities that may enable such companies to market competing products through existing channels of distribution which could provide a substantial advantage.\nProduct liability lawsuits could cause us to incur liabilities, which could be substantial, and require us to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nLike all pharmaceutical companies, we face an inherent business risk related to the sale of TPOXX\u00ae and any other products that we successfully develop and the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials. TPOXX\u00ae is currently identified as a covered countermeasure under the PREP Act declaration issued in October 2008, as amended, which provides us with substantial immunity with respect to the manufacture, administration or use of TPOXX\u00ae. Under our BARDA Contracts, the U.S. Government should indemnify us against claims by third parties for death, personal injury and other damages related to TPOXX\u00ae, including reasonable litigation and settlement costs, to the extent that the claim or loss results from specified risks not covered by insurance or caused by our grossly negligent or criminal behavior. The collection process under the PREP Act can be lengthy and complicated, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to recover these amounts from the U.S. Government.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against future claims that our product or product candidates caused injuries and we are not entitled to or able to obtain indemnity by the U.S. Government with respect to such claims, or if the U.S. Government does not honor its indemnification obligations, we may incur liabilities, which could be substantial. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for any product candidate or product that we may develop; withdrawal of a product from the market; costs and management time and focus to defend the related litigation; substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; loss of revenue; harm to our reputation; the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. Additionally, a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall, could decrease our financial resources and materially exhaust our existing insurance or limit our ability to obtain insurance going forward, all of which would materially adversely affect our business and financial position.\nWe currently have product liability insurance with coverage up to a $10 million annual aggregate limit and a $10 million per occurrence limit. Product liability insurance is difficult to obtain and increasingly expensive. Should we face claims, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nOur activities may involve hazardous materials, use of which may subject us to environmental regulatory liabilities.\nOur biopharmaceutical research and development sometimes may involve the use of hazardous and radioactive materials and generation of biological waste. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products, and may have to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that our CMOs\u2019 safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages, and this liability could exceed our resources. We use through third parties, for example, small amounts of radioactive isotopes commonly used in pharmaceutical research, which are stored, used and disposed of in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations. Our general liability policy provides coverage up to annual aggregate limits of $2 million and coverage of $1 million per occurrence.\nThe loss of key personnel or our ability to recruit or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer and other key executives. Our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit, retain and train high quality employees. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. The loss of services of any members of our key management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased employment changes in many industries, including ours. We cannot predict with certainty how, if at all, this may impact SIGA.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and been targeted at pharmaceutical companies in particular. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Also, confidential patient and other personal or sensitive information may be compromised in a cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nWe may need additional funding, which may not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or limit proposed acquisitions or strategic investments or any of our non-government funded product development programs or commercial efforts.\nAlthough we believe our current cash position is strong, we may require additional financing and, while we have raised funds through credit facilities and the issuance of new equity or the exercise of options or warrants in the past, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in raising such funds should we need to seek to do so. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we could be forced to discontinue, cease or limit certain strategic transactions or operations and equity investors could experience significant or total losses of their investments. Our cash flows may fall short of our projections or be delayed, or our expenses may increase, which could result in our capital being consumed significantly faster than anticipated. If we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, such sales may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Debt financing arrangements, if available, may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 85401, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SIGA"}
