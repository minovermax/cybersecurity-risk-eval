{"cik": "1236997", "company": "COUNTERPATH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMuch of the information included in this annual report includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other \u201cforward looking statements\u201d. Such forward looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumption or other future performance suggested herein.\nSuch estimates, projections or other \u201cforward looking statements\u201d involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that important factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other \u201cforward looking statements\u201d.\nRisks Associated with our Business and Industry\nLack of cash flow which may affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nPresently our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet operating and capital expenses. Our business plan calls for continued research and development of our products and expansion of our market share. We will require additional financing to fund working capital and pay for operating expenses and capital requirements until we achieve a positive cash flow. However, our management projects that under our current operating plan that sufficient cash is available to meet our ongoing operating expenses and working capital requirements through April 30, 2016.\nHowever, there is no assurance that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates. In particular, additional capital may be required in the event that:\n\u2022\nwe incur delays and additional expenses as a result of technology failure;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to create a substantial market for our products; or\n\u2022\nwe incur any significant unanticipated expenses.\nThe occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our ability to meet our proposed business plans.\nWe depend on a mix of revenues and outside capital to pay for the continued development of our technology and the marketing of our products. Such outside capital may include the sale of additional stock and/or commercial borrowing. There can be no assurance that capital will continue to be available if necessary to meet these continuing development costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. Disruptions in financial markets and challenging economic conditions have and may continue to affect our ability to raise capital. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a dilution, possibly a significant dilution, in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.\nOur revenue, operating results and gross margin can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably from quarter - to - quarter and from year - to - year, and we expect that they will continue to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe rate at which our customers order our products, and the size of these orders, are highly variable and difficult to predict. In the past, we have experienced significant variability in our customer purchasing practices on a quarterly and annual basis, and we expect that this variability will continue, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and the timing and size of customer orders;\n\u2022\nlength of sales cycles, which may be extended by selling our products through channel partners;\n\u2022\nlength of time of deployment of our products by our customers;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAs a result of this volatility in our customers\u2019 purchasing practices, our revenue has historically fluctuated unpredictably on a quarterly and annual basis and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of future revenue. Because any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and takes time, if our revenue declines, our operating expenses and general overhead would likely be high relative to revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margin and operating results.\nIf we are not able to manage our operating expenses, then our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOperating expenses increased to $17,349,003 for the year ended April 30, 2015 from $16,885,748 for the year ended April 30, 2014 and our revenue increased to $12,003,083 for the year ended April 30, 2015 from $11,681,948 for the year ended April 30, 2014. Our ability to reach and maintain profitability is conditional upon our ability to manage our operating expenses. There is a risk that we will have to increase our operating expenses in the future. Factors that could cause our operating expenses to increase include our determination to spend more on sales and marketing in order to increase product sales or our determination that more research and development expenditures are required in order to keep our current software products competitive or in order to develop new products for the market. To the extent that our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenue, our financial condition would be adversely impacted.\nWe face larger and better-financed competitors, which may affect our ability to operate our business and achieve or maintain profitability.\nManagement is aware of similar products which compete directly with our products and some of the companies developing these similar products are larger and better-financed than us and may develop products superior to those of our company. In addition to price competition, increased competition may result in other aggressive business tactics from our competitors, such as:\n\u2022\nemphasizing their own size and perceived stability against our smaller size and narrower recognition;\n\u2022\nproviding customers \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d options for the purchase of network equipment and application software;\n\u2022\noffering customers financing assistance;\n\u2022\nmaking early announcements of competing products and employing extensive marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nasserting infringement of their intellectual property rights.\nSuch competition may potentially adversely affect our profitability.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital, or a delisting from a stock exchange on which our common stock trades. Because our operations have been partially financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our continued operations. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations.\nOn December 16, 2014, we received notice from NASDAQ that the closing bid price of our shares for the last 30 consecutive business days no longer met the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share. NASDAQ\u2019s listing rules provide our company with a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance. If at any time during the 180 day period the closing bid price of our shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will be in compliance. Our company had until June 15, 2015 to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement. On June 18, 2015, we received further notice from NASDAQ advising that our shares had not regained compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement, but that the NASDAQ staff had determined that our company would be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until December 14, 2015, to regain compliance with the foregoing requirement. The determination was based on our company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our company\u2019s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If at any time during the additional time period the closing bid price of our shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will be in compliance. If compliance cannot be demonstrated by December 14, 2015, NASDAQ will provide written notification that our shares will be delisted.\nThe majority of our directors and officers are located outside the United States, with the result that it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or some of our directors or officers.\nThe majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons' assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Consequently, investors may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies under United States federal securities laws against some of our directors or officers.\nWe may in the future be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the continued viability of our company.\nWe may be unaware of filed patent applications and issued patents that could relate to our products and services. Intellectual property litigation, if determined against us, could:\n\u2022\nresult in the loss of a substantial number of existing customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers;\n\u2022\ncause us to lose access to key distribution channels;\n\u2022\nresult in substantial employee layoffs or risk the permanent loss of highly-valued employees;\n\u2022\nmaterially and adversely affect our brand in the market place and cause a substantial loss of goodwill;\n\u2022\naffect our ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\ncause our stock price to decline significantly; and\n\u2022\nlead to the bankruptcy or liquidation of our company.\nParties making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products or services and could cause us to pay substantial royalties, licensing fees or damages. The defense of any lawsuit could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims.\nWe could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any proprietary technology and intellectual property rights against infringement, and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly.\nOur success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree on our proprietary technology incorporated in our software. If any of our competitors' copies or otherwise gains access to our proprietary technology or develops similar technologies independently, we would not be able to compete as effectively. We also consider our family of registered and unregistered trademarks including CounterPath, Bria, Stretto Platform, eyebeam, X-Lite, and Softphone.com invaluable to our ability to continue to develop and maintain the goodwill and recognition associated with our brand. The measures we take to protect the proprietary technology software, and other intellectual property rights, which presently are based upon a combination of patents, patents pending, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, may not be adequate to prevent their unauthorized use. Further, the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual property rights.\nWe may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and divert resources from intended uses. In addition, notwithstanding any rights we have secured in our intellectual property, other persons may bring claims against us that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights, including claims based upon the content we license from third parties or claims that our intellectual property right interests are not valid. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources, result in the loss of goodwill associated with our service marks or require us to make changes to our website or other of our technologies.\nOur products may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer demands.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer demands. As a result, our products may quickly become obsolete and unmarketable. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to technological advances, anticipate customer demands, develop new products and enhance our current products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further, our products must remain competitive with those of other companies with substantially greater resources. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced versions of existing products. Also, we may not be able to adapt new or enhanced services to emerging industry standards, and our new products may not be favorably received.\nUnless we can establish broad market acceptance of our current products, our potential revenues may be significantly reduced.\nWe expect that a substantial portion of our future revenue will be derived from the sale of our software products. We expect that these product offerings and their extensions and derivatives will account for a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Broad market acceptance of our software products is, therefore, critical to our future success and our ability to continue to generate revenues. Failure to achieve broad market acceptance of our software products as a result of competition, technological change, or otherwise, would significantly harm our business. Our future financial performance will depend primarily on the continued market acceptance of our current software product offerings and on the development, introduction and market acceptance of any future enhancements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing our current product offerings or any new product offerings, applications or enhancements, and any failure to do so would significantly harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe incorporate open source software into our products. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating expenses.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary licenses of third-party technology on acceptable terms, or at all, which could delay product sales and development and adversely impact product quality.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our current products. We anticipate that we are also likely to need to license additional technology from third-parties to develop new products or product enhancements in the future. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The inability to retain any third-party licenses required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm the competitive position of our products.\nOur products must interoperate with many different networks, software applications and hardware products, and this interoperability will depend on the continued prevalence of open standards.\nOur products are designed to interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing and planned networks, which have varied and complex specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, software applications and products from numerous vendors and contain multiple products that have been added over time. As a result, we must attempt to ensure that our products interoperate effectively with these existing and planned networks. To meet these requirements, we have and must continue to undertake development and testing efforts that require significant capital and employee resources. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. If our products do not interoperate effectively, installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be cancelled, which would harm our revenue, gross margins and our reputation, potentially resulting in the loss of existing and potential customers. The failure of our products to interoperate effectively with our customers\u2019 networks may result in significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our software development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems.\nAdditionally, the interoperability of our products with multiple different networks is significantly dependent on the continued prevalence of standards for IP multimedia services, such as SIP or Session Initiation Protocol. Some of our existing and potential competitors are network equipment providers who could potentially benefit from the deployment of their own proprietary non-standards-based architectures. If resistance to open standards by network equipment providers becomes prevalent, it could make it more difficult for our products to interoperate with our customers\u2019 networks, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products to service providers.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers. Businesses that are good credit risks at the time of sale may become bad credit risks over time. In times of economic recession, the number of our customers who default on payments owed to us tends to increase. If we fail to adequately assess and monitor our credit risks, we could experience longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and higher bad debt expense.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates associated with foreign currencies.\nA majority of our revenue activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in numerous currencies, of which the most significant to our operations for the year ended April 30, 2015 is the Canadian dollar. We are primarily exposed to a fluctuating Canadian dollar as our operating expenses are primarily denominated in Canadian dollars while our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Our company\u2019s foreign currency risk management program includes foreign currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally have a maturity of less than one year. For these derivatives, our company reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction. There can be no assurance that our hedging program will not result in a negative impact on our earnings and earnings per share. We did not enter into any forward contracts for hedging purposes during fiscal 2015 (2014 - none).\nWe also routinely enter into foreign currency forward contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to protect us from fluctuations in exchange rates. As of April 30, 2015 and April 30, 2014, we had no foreign currency forward contracts. Notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of our company, but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nOur directors control a substantial number of shares of our common stock, decreasing your influence on stockholder decisions.\nBased on the 42,333,945 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of April 30, 2015, our directors owned approximately 28% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our directors as a group could have a significant influence in delaying, deferring or preventing any potential change in control of our company; they will be able to strongly influence the actions of our board of directors even if they were to cease being directors of our company and can effectively control the outcome of actions brought to our stockholders for approval. Such a high level of ownership may adversely affect the exercise of your voting and other stockholder rights.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or stock options or the issuance of other stock-based awards or any issuance of shares to raise funds may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nIf the holders of outstanding warrants, stock options and deferred share units exercise or convert all of their warrants, vested stock options and vested deferred share units as at April 30, 2015, then we would be required to issue an additional 3,852,796 shares of our common stock, which would represent approximately 9% of our issued and outstanding common stock after such issuances. The exercise of any or all outstanding warrants or stock options that are exercisable below market price will result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nWe may in the future grant to certain or all of our directors, officers, insiders and key employees stock options to purchase the shares of our common stock, bonus shares and other stock based compensation as non-cash incentives to such persons. Subject to applicable stock exchange rules, if any, we may grant these stock options and other stock based compensation at exercise prices equal to or less than market prices, and we may grant them when the market for our securities is depressed. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock will cause our existing shareholders to experience dilution of their holding of our common stock.\nIn addition, shareholders could suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. Such issuance may cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the price of our shares of common stock or a change in the control of our company.\nWe may be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Penny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, since our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market below the $4.00 minimum bid price per share requirement, our common stock would be considered a penny stock if we fail to satisfy the net tangible assets and revenue tests in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our securities may be covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and/or sell shares of our common stock.\nThe FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for its shares.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analyst reports. As a relatively small public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish information about our common stock will have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports covering us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 13521, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "CPAH"}
