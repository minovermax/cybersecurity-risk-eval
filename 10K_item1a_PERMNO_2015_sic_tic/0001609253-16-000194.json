The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCommodity pricing can fluctuate widely and strongly affects our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and ability to grow.\nOur financial results, financial condition, cash flow and ability to grow correlate closely to the prices we obtain for our products. Since 2014, global energy commodity prices have declined significantly. For example, Brent crude prices declined from over $110 per barrel in June 2014 to below $30 per barrel in January 2016. Continued low prices for our products or further price decreases could have several negative effects described in greater detail below, including:\n\u2022\nreduced cash flow, decreased funds available for capital investments as well as costs incurred to reduce our labor force and otherwise adjust our cost structure;\n\u2022\nreduced proved oil and gas reserves and related cash flows;\n\u2022\nfurther impairments of our oil and gas properties such as we experienced in 2014 and 2015; and\n\u2022\nreduced borrowing base capacity under our credit facility as oil and gas reserves values fall, with the potential for a reduction of our liquidity, mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our banks on our secured assets.\nProduct prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in consumption patterns, inventory levels, global and local economic conditions, the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments, actual or threatened production and refining disruptions, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, the effects of conservation, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, refining and processing disruptions, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for our products; technological advances and regional market conditions; transportation capacity and costs in producing areas; and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. These and other factors make it impossible to predict realized prices reliably. While our hedging activities provide some protection for a significant portion of our 2016 production, they may not adequately protect us from commodity price fluctuations and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges.\nThe sustained downturn in the price of crude oil since 2014 has affected, and may further materially and adversely affect, our financial position, the quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for interest payments, operational expenses and capital investments, our need to post cash collateral or provide letters of credit, our relationships with, or ability to attract, counterparties to our transactions, including hedging transactions, our ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility and through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for asset sales or other monetization transactions.\nOur lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially impact our ability to use or access capital, worsening any reduction in our cash flows and limiting our business activities.\nOn February 23, 2016, we amended our credit facilities which reduced our borrowing base to $2.3 billion and the lenders\u2019 revolving facility commitments to $1.6 billion. At January 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding debt under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, resulting in approximately $560 million of availability, under the new $2.3 billion borrowing base. We may need to depend on our revolving credit facility for a portion of our future capital or operating needs. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility will be further limited by our ability to comply with its covenants, including quarterly financial covenants.\nAs amended, our financial performance covenants through December 31, 2016 comprise an obligation to achieve (i) a cumulative minimum EBITDAX during 2016 of $55 million through the first quarter, $130 million through the second quarter, $190 million through the third quarter and $250 million through the fourth quarter and (ii) a trailing twelve-month minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00 as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, 1.50:1.00 as of the end of the second quarter, 1.25:1.00 as of the end of the third quarter, and 0.70:1.00 as of the end of the fourth quarter. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, the minimum interest coverage ratio will revert back to 2.00:1.00. We will not be subject to a maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio for 2016. The amendment also suspends the requirement for us to comply with a trailing twelve-month maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio of 2.25:1.00 until the end of the first quarter of 2017. Compliance with the first-lien senior secured leverage and the interest expense ratios in the first quarter of 2017 would require prices significantly higher than current prices.\nExcept as otherwise agreed with our lenders for specific transactions, our credit facilities as amended require us to apply 100% of the proceeds from certain asset monetizations to repay loans outstanding under the credit facilities, except that we will be permitted to use up to 40% of proceeds from non-borrowing base asset sales to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum discount to par as specified in the amended facilities. Subject to compliance with our indentures, our amended facilities permit us to incur additional indebtedness to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum discount to par, as specified in the amended facilities, as follows: (i) up to $1 billion, which may be secured by liens that are junior to the liens securing our credit facilities, provided that at least 60% of the proceeds from the new debt is used first to repay loans outstanding under the credit facilities, and (ii) up to $200 million, which may be secured by first-priority liens on our non-borrowing base properties. The amended credit facilities also permit us to incur up to an additional $50 million of non-credit facility indebtedness, which, subject to compliance with our indentures, may be secured; and the proceeds of which must be applied to repay loans outstanding under the credit facilities. All of the foregoing prepayments will be applied first to our term loan and second to our revolving loans after the term loan has been fully repaid (with a corresponding reduction to the lenders\u2019 revolving loan commitments). Our amended facilities also require us to apply cash on hand in excess of $150 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Further, we are restricted from (i) paying dividends or making other distributions to common stockholders and (ii) making capital investments exceeding $100 million during 2016.\nThe amendment also imposed a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination each May 1 and November 1, commencing May 1, 2016. The borrowing base will be based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves levels. Increases in our borrowing base requires approval of at least 80% of our revolving lenders, as measured by exposure, while decreases require a two-thirds approval. We and the lenders (requiring a request from the lenders holding two-thirds of the revolving commitments and outstanding loans), each may request a special redetermination once in any period between three consecutive scheduled redeterminations. Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base could further be substantially reduced, and in the event the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. In that event, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments and may be unable to arrange new financing or sell sufficient assets and could default under our credit facilities. If we are able to take action sufficient to refund a repayment obligation it may significantly affect our business or financial results. Any reduction in our borrowing base could limit our access to capital to fund our capital program, other obligations and business activities.\nSubstantially all of the restrictions imposed by the recent amendment to the credit facilities, other than the requirement for semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations, may terminate in the future if we are able to comply with the financial performance covenants as they existed prior to giving effect to the amendment. If we were to breach any of our credit facility covenants, our lenders would be permitted to accelerate the principal amount due under the credit facilities and foreclose on the assets securing them. If payment were accelerated under our credit facilities, it would result in a default under our outstanding notes and permit acceleration and foreclosure on the assets securing the secured notes.\nContinued reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows, coupled with substantial interest payments, would severely constrain our liquidity.\nThe primary source of liquidity and capital resources to fund our capital program and other obligations is cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As noted above, our borrowing capacity is limited. At current price levels, we estimate that our capital budget for 2016 will be approximately $50 million.\nFurther price declines would further reduce our cash flows from operations and may limit our access to borrowing capacity or cause default under our revolving credit facility as discussed above. If we are unable to achieve improved liquidity through additional financing, asset monetizations, restructuring of our debt obligations or otherwise, cash flow from operations and expected available credit capacity may not be sufficient to meet our commitments over the next twelve months.\nWe continue to evaluate asset monetization transactions and other alternatives to manage our debt capital structure. We cannot assure that any of these efforts will be successful or will result in sufficient cost reductions or additional cash flows or the timing of any such cost reductions or additional cash flows. We recently completed an exchange of newly-issued second lien secured notes for outstanding senior unsecured notes that may deplete a significant portion of our net operating losses such that we may not have sufficient net operating losses available to offset future gains. Additionally, if the current conditions persist, we expect our production levels would decrease as we intend to continue to limit our capital program, which would further reduce cash flow.\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business or otherwise limit our operational flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $6.1 billion of consolidated indebtedness comprised of senior unsecured notes, second lien secured notes and secured credit facility borrowings. At January 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding debt under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, resulting in approximately $560 million of availability, under our $2.3 billion borrowing base in effect as of February 2016 and subject to compliance with our quarterly financial covenants.\nIn addition, the indentures governing our outstanding notes and our credit agreement permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness as well as certain defined obligations, unrestricted by debt incurrence or lien covenants, or that do not constitute indebtedness.\nIndebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate, therefore a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense if and to the extent we do not purchase interest rate hedges.\nOur level of indebtedness may have several important consequences, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\njeopardizing our ability to continue executing our business plans;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business and to general economic and industry conditions, and putting us at a disadvantage against competitors that have lower fixed obligations and more cash flow to devote to their businesses\u037e\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital investments and general corporate and other purposes or increasing the cost of that capital\u037e and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to operate our business, react to competitive pressures and adverse regulatory changes and engage in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nThe covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures may limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets forming the borrowing base for our credit facilities;\n\u2022\nsell assets that constitute borrowing base collateral;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrelease collateral.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other financial needs will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by market, financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that may be unattractive if it can be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations and a default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of all of our debt and foreclosure of assets subject to our secured credit facilities and secured notes.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), it may result in a delisting of our common stock from the NYSE.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE. Continued listing is subject to compliance with a number of listing standards. We were recently notified by the NYSE that we were out of compliance with minimum standards because the average closing price of our common stock as reported on the consolidated tape was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. NYSE rules provide issuers six months from NYSE notification of a deficiency to cure noncompliance with the stock price listing standard before the NYSE begins suspension and delisting procedures. An issuer can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period, the company has a closing stock price of at least $1.00 and an average closing stock price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. Additionally, if our common stock trades at a price below $0.16 per share at any time, the NYSE has advised that they may immediately suspend the trading of our common stock and initiate delisting procedures without an opportunity to cure the listing deficiency.\nSubject to board approval, we intend to seek stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split not later than our Annual Meeting in May. There can be no assurance that stockholders will grant approval or that the deficiency will be cured by subsequent trading prices. Any delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could result in even further reductions in our stock price, would substantially limit the liquidity of our common stock, and would materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Any delisting from the NYSE could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of investor confidence.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital investments for the development and exploration of oil and gas reserves. We invested $401 million of capital during the year ended December 31, 2015, funded by our operating cash flow and were able to minimize production declines. At current price levels, we plan to invest approximately $50 million under our 2016 capital program, which will be funded primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The new amendment to our credit facilities does not permit us to incur capital expenditures in 2016 in excess of $100 million. We expect our planned reductions in capital investment in 2016 to cause our production to decline, and they will begin to reduce our cash flows and possibly our reserves.\nOur ability to deploy capital as planned over the long term depends on a number of variables, including: (i) commodity prices and market access\u037e (ii) regulatory and third-party approvals\u037e (iii) our ability to timely drill wells due to technical factors and contract terms\u037e (iv) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel and (v) drilling and completion costs and results. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned and actual development activities may materially differ from those presently anticipated.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nDuring the course of 2015, we experienced significant and extended price declines from 2014, which impacted the quantity of reserves we reported as of December 31, 2015. The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for Brent oil decreased from $101.30 per barrel for 2014 to $55.57 per barrel for 2015. As a result we experienced negative price related revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2015 of 153 MMBoe. Generally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit. For example, in 2015 we recategorized 69 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves as a result of these constraints and a significant reduction in pricing for 2016 from 2015 may require us to impair or recategorize reserves again in 2017. Our production-sharing contracts in Long Beach tend to partially offset these effects because our share of production and reserves from these contracts increases as prices decline. Cost reduction and efficiency efforts also offset a portion of the price-related loss of reserves quantities as some of the barrels that would have become uneconomic in later years remain economic, a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves that would otherwise be removed from the reserves quantities become economic and we expect to drill more wells with the same amount of capital. We can give no guarantee, however, that we will ultimately be able to continue to realize reductions and efficiencies as we seek to produce our reserves. If the SEC prices for the December 31, 2015 reserves determination were about $10 lower than those actually used, we believe our reserves quantities may have been lower by less than 15%. This estimate does not reflect the effect of further cost savings that we expect to achieve in 2016.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although over 80% of these estimates were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott Company, L.P., we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate. Reserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from similar areas\u037e\n\u2022the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data\u037e\n\u2022commodity prices\u037e\n\u2022production and operating costs\u037e\n\u2022ad valorem, excise and income taxes\u037e\n\u2022development costs\u037e\n\u2022the effects of government regulations\u037e and\n\u2022future workover and remedial costs.\nMisunderstanding of the variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to be our main sources for reserves additions, but factors such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside management\u2019s control and could cause unforeseen results. Any material inaccuracies in these reserves estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks related to our acquisition and disposition activities could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur disposition activities carry risks that (i) we may not be able to realize reasonable prices for assets we sell; (ii) we may be required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated; and (iii) we may lose synergies among elements of our business. Our acquisition activities carry risks that we may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the recent deterioration of oil and natural gas prices\u037e (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties\u037e (iii) experience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy.\nUnless we replace crude oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nOur total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Our reduced expected capital investment in 2016 may result in a future decline in our reserves. To the extent cash flow from operations and external sources of capital remain limited or become unavailable, our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments needed to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves may be impaired. We may not be successful in developing, exploring for or acquiring additional reserves. We also may not be successful in raising funds to acquire additional reserves. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively affecting our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, the production, transportation and sale of our products, and the services we provide. See the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, are also highly regulated. For example, the recent release of natural gas from a utility\u2019s Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in California may result in new regulations that could affect the demand or availability of storage for natural gas, add seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we receive from customers.\nCosts of compliance may increase and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Certain government agencies have adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction, public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, certain oil and gas operations, including drilling, completion, well stimulation, enhanced production techniques, fluid disposal, water recycling and reuse, remediation and closure and decommissioning of our facilities. Such new requirements or restrictions or resulting litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, or production activities, and preclude us from drilling or stimulating wells, which could impair our expected production over the longer term.\nTax law changes may adversely affect our operations.\nIn California, there have been proposals for tax increases for the past several years including a severance tax as high as 12.5% of the value of petroleum production in California. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to future oil and gas severance taxes. The imposition of such a tax could severely reduce our profit margins and cash flow and could ultimately result in lower oil and natural gas production, which may reduce our capital investments and growth plans.\nIn addition, President Obama\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017 recommended the elimination of certain federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies as well as new taxes, all of which could harm us. The elimination of tax preferences includes (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of expensing intangible drilling costs, (iii) an increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geological and geophysical costs paid or incurred by independent producers and (iv) repealing the domestic manufacturing deduction for income derived from the production of oil and gas in the United States.\nThe new taxes on oil companies proposed by President Obama include (i) a $10.25 per Boe tax and (ii) a reinstatement of the Superfund excise tax. If enacted, the new oil tax would be collected on domestically produced crude oil. The oil tax would be phased in over a five-year period beginning October 1, 2016. The reinstatement of the Superfund excise tax would be for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2026.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risk and uncertainty.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our decisions to explore, develop, purchase or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data, the analysis of which is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is also often uncertain. Overruns in budgeted investments are a common risk that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economical than forecast. We bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance, including response to improved recovery or enhanced recovery efforts, and other associated risks.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are geographically concentrated exclusively in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional events. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations, and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, marine and rail transportation capacity constraints, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. The concentration of our operations in California and limited local storage options also increase our exposure to events such as natural disasters, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products. For example, we experienced higher discounts to index prices in the early part of 2015, which reflected the result of local refinery and pipeline events and local price posting mechanisms.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation techniques could cause us to incur increased costs and experience additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of fluid under pressure into underground rock formations containing oil and natural gas to create or enlarge fractures to stimulate production by allowing fluids to flow more freely into the oil and gas well. In 2013 California adopted SB 4, which mandated further regulation of certain well stimulation techniques, including hydraulic fracturing and acid matrix stimulation. Among other things, SB 4 requires operators to obtain specific well stimulation permits, notify proximate property owners or lessees of proposed stimulation treatments, disclose the fluids used and other stimulation data and implement groundwater monitoring and water management plans. In addition, the EPA and the BLM adopted or proposed additional federal regulations in 2015 on certain well stimulation operations. The implementation of federal and state well stimulation regulations and associated studies and reports have delayed and increased the cost of certain operations, and additional regulations may further increase costs and cause additional delays.\nIn addition, certain local governments have proposed or adopted ordinances that purport, within their jurisdictions, to regulate certain drilling activities in general, or well stimulation or completion activities in particular, including hydraulic fracturing, or to ban such activities outright. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain, use, manage or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWater management is an essential component of our operations. We treat and re-use water for a substantial portion of our needs related to activities such as steamflooding, waterflooding, pressure management, well completion and stimulation, including limited hydraulic fracturing, and we provide reclaimed water for agricultural use in certain areas. We also use supplied water from various local and regional sources, particularly for power plants and to support operations like steam injection in certain fields. Due to severe drought in California, some local and regional water districts and the state government are implementing regulations and policies that restrict water usage and increase the cost of water.\nExisting laws and regulations restrict our ability and increase our cost to manage and dispose of water and other fluids. The federal Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of and injection of fluids, including produced water. We must obtain permits or waivers for certain surface discharges and subsurface injection, as well as for construction activities that may affect regulated water resources. Certain government agencies have investigated and continue to study whether the discharge or injection of produced water could affect water quality or induce ground movement or seismicity, which may result in additional regulations under federal and state laws. Our enhanced production operations or fluid disposal could give rise to litigation over claims related to alleged damage to the environment or private or public property. The laws, regulations, policies and attendant liabilities relating to the use, disposal and injection of water and other fluids could increase our costs and negatively affect our development and production activities.\nWe may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all and sites we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in economically producible quantities.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our ability to profitably drill and develop these locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. The risk profile for our exploration and prospective drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular for our prospective resource locations, which are in unproven geologic plays. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented 19% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2015. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nInvestment in exploration carries inherent operational and financial risk and its results are unpredictable. The results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production, and we may increase the proportion of our drilling in new or emerging plays over time. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas, in which case the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOne of our important assets is our acreage in the Monterey shale play in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. The geology of the Monterey shale is highly complex and not uniform due to localized and varied faulting and changes in structure and rock characteristics. As a result, it differs from other shale plays that can be developed in part on the basis of their uniformity. Instead, individual Monterey shale drilling sites may need to be more fully understood and may require a more precise development approach, which could affect our ability, the timing or the cost to develop this asset.\nOur Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) Agreement may limit our ability to operate outside of California.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into an AMI Agreement, which provides Occidental with the right to acquire a 51% interest in, and rights with respect to, certain oil and gas properties we acquire in the United States, other than in the State of California, for five years following the completion of the Spin-off. If we were to change our current strategy of focusing exclusively on opportunities in California, the AMI Agreement could adversely affect our ability to pursue opportunities outside of California during the five years following the Spin-off.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could negatively affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nOur current commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels stated in the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n\u2022\na change in price basis differentials;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements;\n\u2022\nan event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices in the opposite direction of our derivative positions; and\n\u2022\nour production is materially less than the notional volumes.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect our operations or results.\nConcerns about climate change and regulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) may affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to climate change may increase our operating costs. California has led other states in adopting GHG emission reduction requirements as well as mandates for renewable fuel sources. In 2006, California adopted AB 32, which established a statewide cap on GHG emissions, including on the oil and natural gas production industry, and a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d program. Since 2012, California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations have required us to obtain GHG emissions allowances corresponding to reported GHG emissions from operations and, starting in 2015, from the sale of certain products to customers for use in California. In 2015, we incurred approximately $21 million for mandatory GHG emissions allowances in California, and costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as CARB reduces the number of available allowances, increases their targeted price and covers more operations and products in the program.\nThe EPA has also adopted regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis. In 2015, the EPA expanded the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule to include gathering and compression facilities as well as completions and workovers from wells that have undergone hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also proposed regulations in 2015 that would require emission controls for methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. These additional regulations could increase our costs.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal and state laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels and electricity generation, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy, which could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products and services.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in Southern and Central California where most of our operations are located, are in many instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations. As these requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner. As a result of existing and future air quality initiatives, we could face risks of increased costs and taxes, an inability to execute projects and reduced demand for our products and services.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities, are subject to operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, equipment failures and industrial accidents. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wildfires, droughts, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect our business and the communities in which we operate. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nCyber attacks could affect us significantly.\nCyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. We rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information. If we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nIn connection with our separation from Occidental, we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, including those related to the operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental, and Occidental agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, which indemnities may not be adequate.\nPursuant to agreements with Occidental, Occidental has indemnified us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnity payments that we may be required to provide Occidental may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnity payments relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that Occidental has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Occidental will be sufficient or timely to protect us against the full effect of such liabilities.\nOur Tax Sharing Agreement with Occidental may limit our ability to take certain actions, including strategic transactions, and may require us to indemnify Occidental for significant tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement between Occidental and CRC, we have agreed to take certain actions or refrain from taking certain actions to ensure that the Spin-off and certain transactions taken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off qualify for tax-free status under the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We have also made various other covenants in the Tax Sharing Agreement intended to ensure the tax-free status of the Spin-off. These covenants restrict our ability to sell assets outside the ordinary course of business, to issue or sell additional common stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our common stock), or to enter into certain other corporate transactions. For example, for a period of two years after the final disposition of the securities retained by Occidental after the Spin-off, absent approval by Occidental, we may not enter into any transaction that would be reasonably likely to cause us to undergo either a 30% or greater change in the ownership of our voting stock or a 30% or greater change in the ownership (measured by vote or value) of all classes of our stock.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Occidental for (a) taxes incurred as a result of the failure of the Spin-off or certain transactions undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off to qualify as tax-free transactions under the relevant provisions of the Code to the extent caused by (i) our breach of certain tax-related representations or covenants made in connection with the Spin-off, (ii) actions, failures to act and omissions inconsistent with such representations and covenants and (iii) certain permitted transactions, and (b) any finally determined increases of our liability for separate tax items included in combined or consolidated Occidental returns. We also have agreed to pay 50% of any taxes arising from the Spin-off or related transactions to the extent that the tax is not attributable to the fault of either party. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Occidental and its remaining subsidiaries against claims and liabilities relating to the past operation of our business.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities for periods during which Occidental operated our business.\nFor any tax periods (or portion thereof) in which Occidental owned at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our common stock, we and our subsidiaries were included in Occidental\u2019s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we or one or more of our subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of Occidental or one or more of its subsidiaries for state or local income tax purposes. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we will be responsible for any increase in Occidental\u2019s federal or state tax liability for any period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are combined or consolidated with Occidental if such increase results from audit adjustments attributable to our business. By virtue of Occidental\u2019s controlling ownership and the Tax Sharing Agreement, Occidental will effectively control all of our tax decisions in connection with any consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we (or any of our subsidiaries) are included. The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that Occidental will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to prepare and file all consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we are included on our behalf (including the making of any tax elections). This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between Occidental and us. For example, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Occidental will be able to choose to contest, compromise or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to Occidental and detrimental to us.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the Tax Sharing Agreement, federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group\u2019s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent Occidental or other members of Occidental\u2019s consolidated group fail to make any federal income tax payments required by law, we could be liable for the shortfall with respect to periods in which we were a member of Occidental\u2019s consolidated group. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state or local income tax purposes where Occidental or its subsidiaries have filed combined, consolidated or unitary returns that include us.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities if the Spin-off, and certain transactions in preparation therefore, are not tax-free.\nIn certain circumstances, if the Spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant liabilities under the Tax Sharing Agreement between us and Occidental. Occidental received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) to the effect that certain aspects of the transactions that were undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off would not cause the distribution to be taxable to Occidental or its affiliates. Occidental also received opinions from tax counsel that (i) certain transactions that were undertaken in preparation for, or in connection with, the Spin-off would not be taxable to Occidental or its affiliates for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the Spin-off generally qualified as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The private letter ruling relied and the opinions relied on facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Occidental and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Occidental may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinions of its tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinions of Occidental\u2019s tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-off is taxable in full or in part. The IRS may determine that the Spin-off is taxable for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Occidental or us after the Spin-off.\nSeveral members of our board of directors and management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of common stock of Occidental and the overlap of one member of our board of directors with the board of directors of Occidental.\nSeveral members of our board of directors and management own common stock of Occidental or options to purchase common stock of Occidental, because of their current or prior relationships with Occidental, which create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Occidental and us. In addition, our board and the board of directors of Occidental have one member in common, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-off is subject to review under various federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that Occidental or any of its subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the Spin-off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the new debt incurred by us in connection with the Spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the Spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) had unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the Spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. The court could impose a number of different remedies, including voiding our liens and claims against Occidental, or providing Occidental with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Occidental and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if:\n\u2022\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair value of all its assets;\n\u2022\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u2022it could not pay its debts as they become due.\nNo assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Occidental or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Occidental and us, from and after the Spin-off, we and Occidental each is responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-off, and we and Occidental and each assumed and retained certain liabilities for the operation of our respective businesses prior to the Spin-off and certain liabilities related to the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Occidental, particularly if Occidental were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.\nThe agreements between us and Occidental were not made on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe agreements we entered into with Occidental in connection with the Spin-off, were negotiated while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Occidental. As a result, the terms of those agreements may be unfavorable and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and other obligations between Occidental and us.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
