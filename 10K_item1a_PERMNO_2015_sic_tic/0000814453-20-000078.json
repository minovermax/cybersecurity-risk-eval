{"cik": "814453", "company": "NEWELL BRANDS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe ownership of the Company\u2019s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company\u2019s securities. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the strength of the retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent Europe, Latin America and Asia. These sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, can be affected by specific events or general economic conditions, including worldwide or country-specific economic instability.\nFor example, uncertainty over the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, which could harm consumer demand and ultimately adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. Continuing challenging global economic conditions, particularly outside of the U.S., and potential volatility in domestic and/or foreign equity markets, may result in considerable pressure on consumer demand, which may have an adverse effect on demand for the Company\u2019s products, as well as its financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions. Such events\ncould negatively impact the Company\u2019s overall liquidity and/or create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions. Consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and e-commerce companies.\nThe Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products, many of which are large and well-established. A proliferation of digitally native brands has further intensified the competitive landscape. The Company\u2019s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, direct-to-consumer channels, specialty retailers and wholesalers, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The dominant share of the market represented by these large retailers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, has contributed to the formation of dominant multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Current trends among retailers and e-commerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, reducing inventory levels, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive, economic or other factors, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. Other trends are for retailers and e-commerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands, typically at lower prices, that compete with the Company\u2019s products.\nThe combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company\u2019s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers, such as overall store and inventory reductions. The intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future. For example, the Company\u2019s results in 2018 were impacted negatively by the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us. In particular, a loss of, or a failure by, another one of the Company\u2019s large customers could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales and operating cash flows. To address these challenges, the Company must be able to respond to competitive factors, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s future financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is relatively fragmented. Although the Company has long-established relationships with many customers, the Company generally does not have any long-term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers. Purchases by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders. As a result, these customers may cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control or change other terms of the business relationship. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, because many of the Company\u2019s costs are fixed, a reduction in customer demand due to decreased sales to end customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s gross profit margins and operating income. The retail landscape in many of the Company\u2019s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of e-commerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop on-line) and the emergence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. The rapid growth in e-commerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with its key retailers, whereby the number of products it sells will no longer be a reliable indicator of the amount of future business the Company can expect.\nThe Company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large, high-volume retail customers; however, the Company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers. Retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to:\n\u2022\nreduce lead times for product delivery, which may require the Company to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales;\n\u2022\nimprove customer service, such as with direct import programs, whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from third-party suppliers; and\n\u2022\nadopt technologies related to inventory management such as Radio Frequency Identification, otherwise known as RFID technology, which may have substantial implementation costs.\nThe Company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers or that customer demand will remain consistent. A substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers and an inability to adapt to the emergence of alternative retail channels could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s customers may further consolidate, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and margins.\nThe Company\u2019s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades. The Company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers, close retail outlets, reduce inventory, and rationalize their supply chain, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that, following consolidation, the Company\u2019s large customers will continue to buy from the Company across different product categories or geographic regions, or at the same levels as prior to consolidation, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results. Further, if the consolidation trend continues, it could result in future pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation. Its long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand. The Company\u2019s ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential, especially in light of e-commerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the Company\u2019s products. In addition, sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the Company\u2019s existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, the Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf the Company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the Company\u2019s retail and other customers will need the Company\u2019s products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow the Company to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While the Company plans to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.\nCircumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough the ATP is now completed, the Company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit. Divestitures or discontinuations of businesses or products may result in asset impairments, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and losses upon disposition, both of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner, and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing. Past and future divestitures and business discontinuations also involve additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of the Company\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees; and\n\u2022\ndisputes or litigation with the buyers.\nThe Company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFailure to grow the Company\u2019s e-commerce business, and the cost of its increasing e-commerce investments, may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail industry is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping on-line and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. At the same time, the portion of retail business at traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d stores and shopping centers is decreasing.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes investments in e-commerce, and investments in technology initiatives. If these investments fail to adequately or effectively allow the Company to grow its e-commerce business, maintain or grow its overall market position or otherwise benefit the Company, the Company\u2019s market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of sales by the Company\u2019s other customers, which could, if not offset by a greater increase in e-commerce sales, materially adversely affect the business of the Company.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact its financial performance over the longer term. There can be no assurance that investments in e-commerce infrastructure and technology will result in increased sales, through e-commerce or otherwise.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, and our failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nAs further detailed in Item 9A below, management has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. One material weakness was disclosed in the Company\u2019s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on March 4, 2019 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, related to accounting for the impact of divestitures. The Company also discovered a material weakness in December 2019 related to accounting for certain tax matters. These control deficiencies could have resulted in a misstatement of accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nTo remediate the material weakness in accounting for divestitures, the Company has completed the documentation and testing of the following corrective actions:\n\u2022\nEnhanced the level of review of deferred tax balances for each business that is categorized as held for sale considering the form of divestiture transaction;\n\u2022\nSupplemented the review of deferred tax balances by legal entity and account to ensure proper presentation for financial reporting purposes;\n\u2022\nEnhanced the review of the intra-period tax allocation between continuing and discontinued operations;\n\u2022\nEnhanced the review of the calculation of historical and current tax basis utilized in the gain/loss calculation;\n\u2022\nEnhanced the held for sale footnote reconciliation process; and\n\u2022\nEnhanced the review and approval process for the underlying data utilized in determining the estimated fair value and expected form of sale reflected in the Company\u2019s impairment test.\nThough management has effectively and successfully operated the non-tax components of the aforementioned remediation plan for three consecutive quarters in 2019, this material weakness will not be considered remediated until each component of\nmanagement\u2019s remedial actions operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing of divestiture transactions or otherwise, that these controls are operating effectively.\nDuring the course of 2019, management made certain changes as part of the remediation of the material weakness related to accounting for divestitures, which relate to the material weakness for accounting for income taxes and which the Company believes will contribute to the remediation efforts of the material weakness. These changes include:\n\u2022\nHiring experienced resources with substantive backgrounds in accounting for income taxes as well as U.S. multinational public company experience; and\n\u2022\nEngaging a third party to review the Company\u2019s tax provision processes, identify inefficiencies, and recommend process enhancements.\nSubsequent to the identification of the material weakness for accounting for income taxes, management began to implement a tax reporting software solution that has enhanced our visibility of uncertain tax positions in order to remediate the material weakness.\nThe Company plans to implement the following additional steps to remediate the material weakness for accounting for income taxes:\n\u2022\nImplementing enhancements and process improvements to the quarterly and annual provision with respect of uncertain tax positions and state income taxes; and\n\u2022\nUndertaking extensive training for key personnel in each reporting jurisdiction on tax reporting requirements and our redesigned processes; and\n\u2022\nImplementing a tax reporting software solution that will enhance our state income tax reporting capabilities.\nWhile management believes that it now has the requisite personnel to operate the controls in the tax function and the remediation actions described above should remediate the material weakness with respect to accounting for income taxes, as management continues the remediation process, it may determine certain additional enhancements may be necessary. This material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate.\nAny failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the identification of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements that may continue undetected, negatively impact the public perception of the Company and our securities and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations or incur significant additional costs to remediate the material weakness, each of which could harm our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in the future or otherwise have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nThe Company has substantial indebtedness, which could materially and adversely affect the Company and its financial position, including decreasing its business flexibility, impacting its ratings and increasing its borrowing costs.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $5.7 billion in outstanding debt, reflecting a reduction of approximately $1.3 billion versus the end of 2018. The Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness has had, and could continue to have, important consequences for the Company, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, which reduces the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, adverse business and economic conditions or changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industries in which it operates;\n\u2022\nplacing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, along with the financial and non-financial covenants in the Company\u2019s debt documents, its ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, if the Company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness, the Company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources, which could increase its total debt-to-capitalization ratios, decrease its interest coverage ratios, lower its credit ratings, result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the Company going forward.\nAn increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nWhile the vast majority of the Company\u2019s debt is fixed, fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable, and interest rate increases on this portion of the Company\u2019s debt could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Indeed, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and cash flows. In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate nine times since December 2015, including four times in 2018, each time by a quarter of a percentage point, before reducing interest rates in 2019 three times. Any change in the fiscal policies or stated target interest rates of the U.S. Federal Reserve or other central banking institutions, or market expectations of such change, are difficult to predict and may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates. Such a transition may be abrupt and may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness.\nAn increase in interest rates may also occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the contemplated transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark reference for short-term interest rates. Such a transition may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve has sponsored the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), which serves as a forum to coordinate and track planning as market participants currently using LIBOR consider (a) transitioning to alternative reference rates where it is deemed appropriate and (b) addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that LIBOR might stop. On April 3, 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve began publishing three new reference rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). ARRC has recommended SOFR as the alternative to LIBOR and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment and a Paced Transition Plan to SOFR use. The Financial Stability Board has taken an interest in LIBOR and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate, such as LIBOR, ceases publication. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in July and August 2018. It cannot be predicted whether SOFR or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces LIBOR, and if so, the effects on our customers, or our future results of operations or financial condition.\nGovernmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is also subject to formal and informal regulatory and governmental examinations, subpoenas, requests for documents, testimony or information, inquiries, investigations, threatened legal actions and proceedings. In particular, on January 31, 2020, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC primarily relating to its sales practices and certain accounting matters. See Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Responding to governmental investigations, voluntary document requests, subpoenas or actions by regulatory bodies may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the Company\u2019s business operations. The impact of these inquiries and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.\nChanges in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, data privacy, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the Company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company\u2019s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAs a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. may not be taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company\u2019s financial results could be impacted.\nOn June 18, 2019, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released temporary regulations under IRC Section 245A (\u201cSection 245A\u201d) as enacted by the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform Legislation (\u201c2017 Tax Reform\u201d) and IRC Section 954(c)(6) (the \u201cTemporary Regulations\u201d) to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 Tax Reform was enacted. The Temporary Regulations seek to limit the 100% dividends received deduction permitted by Section 245A for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the look-through exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations. Before the retroactive application of the Temporary Regulations, the Company benefited in 2018 from both the 100% dividends received deduction and the look-through exception to foreign personal holding company income. The Company has analyzed the Temporary Regulations and concluded that the relevant Temporary Regulations were not validly issued. Therefore, the Company has not accounted for the effects of the Temporary Regulations in its Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ending December 31, 2019. The Company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained. However, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations, as well as a potential litigation process, there can be no assurances that the relevant Temporary Regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the Company. If the Company\u2019s position on the Temporary Regulations is not sustained, the Company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately $180 million to $220 million related to an income tax benefit from the 2018 year that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time. In addition, the Company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, as well as the impact of tariffs.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent, in part, on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in the cost of raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services through a variety of programs, including periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts, sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Also, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for its products. These manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures, which may, in turn, result in an increase in the amount the Company pays for sourced products. During periods of rising prices of raw materials, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers. Conversely, when raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent the Company has existing inventory, lower margins. As a result, fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the products the Company manufactures require particular types of glass, metal, paper, plastic, resin, wax, wood or other materials. Supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the Company\u2019s products. Pricing and availability of finished goods, raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the Company\u2019s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control, including general, domestic and international economic conditions, natural disasters, labor costs, production levels, competition, consumer demand, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates.\nSpecifically, evolving trade policies could continue to make sourcing products from foreign countries difficult and costly, as the Company sources a significant amount of its products from outside of the United States. Considerable political uncertainty exists in the United States and abroad that could result in continuing changes to the national and international trade policies around which the Company has built its sourcing practices and operations. Given the Company's reliance upon non-domestic suppliers, any significant changes to the United States trade policies (and those of other countries in response) may cause a material adverse effect on its ability to source products from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, in March 2018, the current presidential administration-imposed tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. These tariffs, which remain in effect, apply to imported steel and aluminum products from most of the world. In addition, the current presidential administration imposed additional tariffs of 25% on many Chinese-origin goods effective July 6, 2018 and August 23, 2018, and imposed additional tariffs of 10% on a substantial number of additional Chinese-origin goods (\u201cList 3 Products\u201d) effective September 24, 2018 (the 10% tariff on List 3 Products increased to 25% on May 10, 2019). The current presidential administration also imposed 15% tariffs on additional Chinese-origin goods, List 4a, on September 1, 2019. The Phase 1 agreement signed on January 15, 2020, reduced List 4a from 15% to 7.5% (effective February 14, 2020) and suspended tariffs under List 4b at 15%, which was due to go into effect on December 15, 2019. In addition to tariffs on Chinese-origin goods, on October 18, 2019, the current presidential administration imposed additional tariffs on certain products imported into the United States from the European Union. Any extension of tariffs to additional categories of goods or to additional importers or exporters or additional countries of origin could significantly increase the cost of some our products and reduce our margins. The Company will continue to work to mitigate the tariff exposure, in part through pricing, productivity and in some cases relocation. However, there can be no assurance these mitigation efforts will be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon third-party vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties. The Company\u2019s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the Company\u2019s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. In many cases, the Company does not enter into long-term contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers, instead buying parts and products on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis. As a result, the Company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products.\nThe ability of third-party suppliers to timely deliver finished goods and/or raw materials, and the ability of the Company\u2019s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods, may be affected by events beyond their control, such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns, or significant weather and health conditions affecting manufacturers and/or shippers. Any adverse change in the Company\u2019s relationships with its third-party suppliers, the financial condition of third-party suppliers, the ability of third-party suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis, or the Company\u2019s ability to import products from third-party suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the financial condition of the Company\u2019s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years. In addition, in some instances the Company maintains single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. For example, certain businesses in the Baby business unit have a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products. Should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, the Company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner, if at all. Any inability of the Company\u2019s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply, quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the Company. The Company cannot assure you that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose, and the Company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its third-party suppliers. The Company\u2019s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products.\nChanges in foreign, cultural, political and financial market conditions could impair the Company\u2019s international operations and financial performance.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed, such as Brazil; or where economies have suffered economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation; or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired. Current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies, including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls, may not be sustainable and, as a result, the Company\u2019s sales or profits related to those countries may decline. The economies of other foreign countries important to the Company\u2019s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation in the future. The Company\u2019s international operations (and particularly its business in emerging markets), including manufacturing and sourcing operations (and the international operations of the Company\u2019s customers), are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the Company, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nprotectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing, sales or import and export of the Company\u2019s products, including tariffs and countermeasures;\n\u2022\nnew restrictions on access to markets;\n\u2022\nlack of developed infrastructure;\n\u2022\ninflation (including hyperinflation) or recession;\n\u2022\ndevaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies;\n\u2022\nchanges in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws, accounting standards, trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws;\n\u2022\nsocial, political or economic instability;\n\u2022\nacts of war and terrorism;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other crises;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties and taxation;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfer of funds and/or exchange of currencies;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of assets or forced relocations of operations; and\n\u2022\nother adverse changes in policies, including monetary, tax and/or lending policies, encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by host countries.\nIn addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operational results to suffer. For example, in December 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has resulted in travel disruption and an impact on corporate operations in China. At this point, the exact extent to which the Coronavirus may impact our supply chain or results of operations is uncertain; however, our revenues may be impacted in the first half of 2020.\nFurther, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Because of the referendum, the British government began negotiating the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. While the European Union and United Kingdom reached an agreement on Brexit in October 2019, and the United Kingdom exited the European Union on January 31, 2020, details of the new trade and regulatory relationship are still to be finalized. There may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities in the future. These changes could cause disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services, and people to and from the United Kingdom, disruptions to the workforce or the workforce of the Company\u2019s suppliers or business partners, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal, political, and economic uncertainty. The foregoing could create uncertainty surrounding the Company\u2019s business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers, which could increase the cost of some of the Company\u2019s products, thereby reducing its margins. Further, the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company\u2019s small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks. Depending on the extent to which the Company may be required to make material changes to its European operations beyond those currently planned, the Company\u2019s results of operations and business prospects could be negatively affected.\nShould any of these risks occur, the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture, source, sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired; the Company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations; and/or the Company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe reporting currency for the Company\u2019s financial statements is the U.S. dollar and it has substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The preparation of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements requires translation of those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to the Company\u2019s results of operations from period to period. Although the Company may employ, at times, a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities, it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective, and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, foreign currency transaction risk arises when the Company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions where the settlement occurs in a currency other than its functional currency. Exchange differences (gains and losses) arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period in which they arise. Although the Company may employ, at times, a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction risk, including the hedging of forecasted cash inflows and outflows, it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective, and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nSee Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nA cyber-attack or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business or reputation.\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, networks and services, including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n\u2022\nconverting materials to finished products;\n\u2022\nshipping products to customers;\n\u2022\nmarketing and selling products to consumers;\n\u2022\ncollecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including data that may be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act;\n\u2022\nprocessing transactions;\n\u2022\nsummarizing and reporting results of operations;\n\u2022\nhosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;\n\u2022\ncomplying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements;\n\u2022\nproviding data security; and\n\u2022\nhandling other processes necessary to manage the Company\u2019s business.\nIncreased IT security threats and cyber-crime, including advanced persistent threats, computer viruses, ransomware, other types of malicious code, hacking, phishing and social engineering schemes designed to provide access to the Company\u2019s networks or data, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s relationships with, and access provided to, third parties and their vendors may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after an attack or breach occurs.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the Company\u2019s, or its third-party service providers\u2019, databases or systems. The Company\u2019s operations, especially its retail operations, involve the storage and transmission of employees\u2019, customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers. The Company\u2019s payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud. If the IT systems, networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly, or if the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 data, business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations, a risk of government enforcement action, litigation and possible liability, and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, if the Company\u2019s service providers, suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the Company\u2019s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations, which would adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing or use of consumer, customer, vendor or employee information or related data, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which goes into effect on January 1, 2020. The changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data, subject the Company to additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to the Company\u2019s security systems, policies, procedures and practices.\nContinued declines in the future expected cash flows for the Company\u2019s businesses or changes to underlying assumptions used to calculate fair value could result in additional impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results of operations.\nThe Company is required under U.S. GAAP to review its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are also required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently, if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an other-than-temporary impairment exists.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of $1.2 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, in continuing operations and $112.1 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, in discontinued operations. Future events or factors may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s assets and require impairment charges. Such events or factors may include, but are not limited to, divestitures of certain businesses, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Company\u2019s sales and customer base, a material adverse change in the Company\u2019s relationship with significant customers or business partners, or a sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price. In the event any such impairment indicators become known or are present, the Company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future. Given the Company\u2019s impairment charges in 2019 and 2018, there is minimal difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of some of the Company\u2019s reporting units and intangible assets, increasing the possibility of future impairment charges.\nUnfavorable shifts in industry-wide demand for the Company\u2019s products could result in inventory valuation risk.\nThe Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, the Company writes off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, product design changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence, or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate net realizable market value.\nIf future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company\u2019s estimates, inventory write-downs may be required. The Company cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for its products, will not affect it beyond the inventory charges that have already been recorded.\nThe Company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations.\nIn addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, the Company may be liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the Company, is a landfill or other location where it has disposed of wastes, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the Company\u2019s ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the Company and others at these properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted. The Company does not believe that any of the Company\u2019s existing remediation obligations, including at third-party sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party, will have a material adverse effect upon its business, results of operations or financial condition. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these and other environmental-related matters.\nThe Company may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its turnaround plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. In 2019, the Company hired a new President & Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Human Resources Officer, and the current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer joined the Company in December 2018 and March 2019, respectively. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.\nThe resolution of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions internationally. Significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the Company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals. There can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the potential for product recalls, product liability and other claims against it, which could affect its earnings and financial condition.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, the Company is subject to the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the Company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products. Additionally, other laws and agencies, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, regulate certain consumer products sold by the Company in the United States and abroad, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. From time to time, the Company has announced voluntary recalls of its products where it has identified potential product safety concerns. For example, in 2019 the Company announced a voluntary recall of the Contigo Gizmo product due to a concern over the silicone spout detaching from the nylon base, which resulted in significant product returns and other costs. Any repurchase or recall of the Company\u2019s products could be costly and damaging to the Company\u2019s reputation. If the Company were required to remove, or it voluntarily removed, its products from the market, the Company\u2019s reputation could be tarnished and the Company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell. The Company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects.\nIn addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact the value of its end-user brands, or result in an increase in the cost of producing the Company\u2019s products. Similar to product liability claims, the Company faces exposure to class action lawsuits related to the performance, safety or advertising of its products. Such class action suits could result in substantial monetary judgments, injunctions related to the sale of products and potentially tarnish the Company\u2019s reputation.\nAlthough the Company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable, that insurance is, in most cases, subject to large self-insured retentions for which the Company is responsible, and the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage. The Company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage. Additionally, the Company does not maintain product recall insurance and may not have insurance coverage for claims asserted in class action lawsuits. As a result, product recalls, product liability claims and other product-related claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards. However, compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. As a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s product liability insurance program is an occurrence-based program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance. The Company currently either self-insures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks. Historically, product liability awards have rarely exceeded the Company\u2019s individual per occurrence self-insured retention. The Company cannot give assurance, however, that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to self-insured retention will not be material.\nSee Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigation-related matters.\nIf the Company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s market share and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success with its proprietary products depends, in part, on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights, including its patent and trademark rights. If the Company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products.\nThe Company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products. The Company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products. The Company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the Company receives or licenses. In addition, patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the Company\u2019s products.\nIf the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impaired.\nIf the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party marks, ideas, or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company\u2019s business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if the Company is not found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims, and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide, or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.\nReductions in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s cost of capital. The Company\u2019s credit ratings reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of its financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations. The credit ratings assigned to the Company also impact the interest rates paid on short- and long-term financing.\nOn February 20, 2019, Fitch downgraded the Company\u2019s long-term issuer default Rating from \u201cBBB-\u201d to BB+ and the short-term issuer default rating to \u201cB\u201d from \u201cF3.\u201d Further, on November 1, 2019, Standard and Poor\u2019s Rating Services (\u201cStandard & Poor\u2019s\u201d) reduced the Company\u2019s long-term issuer credit rating to \u201cBB+\u201d from \u201cBBB-,\u201d resulting in a reduction of the Company\u2019s senior debt below investment grade. This resulted in an increase in the cost of short-term and long-term borrowing for the Company, including a twenty-five-basis point increase in the interest rate payable on approximately $4.5 billion of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes issued in March 2016, for which the interest rates payable are subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody\u2019s or Standard & Poor\u2019s downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the rating assigned to such Notes. While the interest on these Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in ratings by either credit Rating Agency) if such Notes become rated \u201cBaa1\u201d or higher by Moody\u2019s and \u201cBBB+\u201d or higher by Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC, in each case with stable or positive outlook, the Company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will be upgraded in the near future, or that, in the alternative, such ratings will not be further lowered by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.\nAny downgrade by Moody\u2019s Investor Services, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) which would further reduce the Company\u2019s senior debt below investment-grade and would further increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs would continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. In addition, in the event of a future reduction in credit rating, the Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. If the Company\u2019s short-term ratings were to be further lowered, it would limit, or eliminate entirely, the Company\u2019s access to the commercial paper market. If the Company\u2019s access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, or eliminated entirely, and it were required to obtain short-term funding under its revolving credit facility or its other credit facilities, the Company would face increased exposure to variable interest rates.\nThe ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company\u2019s securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nSee \"Factors Affecting Liquidity\" in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations could also affect the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements.\nThe funding obligations for the Company\u2019s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, the Company could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore the Company\u2019s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the Company\u2019s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans are determined by the Company in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that the Company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected health care costs, or mortality rates, the Company\u2019s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that the Company uses may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nDamage to the Company\u2019s reputation could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s strong reputation with consumers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the Company\u2019s continued success. Adverse publicity about the Company, its brands, corporate practices, or any other issue that may be associated with the Company, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize that reputation. Such adverse publicity could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation, but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the Company or its brands.\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\nFurther, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nFinally, there has been an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, the Company announces certain initiatives regarding its focus areas, which may include environmental matters, packaging, responsible sourcing and social investments. The Company could fail, or be perceived to fail, in its achievement of such initiatives or it could fail in accurately reporting its progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, the Company could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. The Company\u2019s reputation and business could be negatively impacted by such developments.\nDamage to the Company\u2019s reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in the Company\u2019s brands could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as, require resources to repair the harm.\nA deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s global business.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 30,000 employees worldwide, a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute. The Company periodically negotiates with certain unions and labor representatives and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms, or at all, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s plans to integrate its acquired businesses, improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful, which would materially adversely affect its financial results.\nThe Company has pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses, or technologies from third parties. The Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to integrate such acquired brands, businesses, or technologies, to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies, to reduce supply chain costs and to streamline and redeploy nonstrategic selling, general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a best-cost position and allow the Company to invest in innovation and brand building, including advertising and promotion. Future acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or significant integration and transaction costs. Any of these risks, should they materialize, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Further, the Company is in the midst of implementing various plans to reduce costs and improve cash flows. These efforts are designed to reduce the complexity of the organization, improve the Company\u2019s cash conversion cycle and increase investment in the Company\u2019s most significant growth platforms. These initiatives are further designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, and distribution and logistics, among other things. These global initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned, may be more costly to implement than expected, or may not result in, in full or in part, the positive effects anticipated. Other major productivity, streamlining and divestment programs may also be required in the future. Such initiatives may require the Company to implement a significant amount of organizational change, which could have a negative impact on employee engagement, divert management\u2019s attention from other concerns, and if not properly managed, impact the Company\u2019s ability to retain key employees, cause disruptions in the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies, including the Company. During 2018, the Company was the target of a proxy contest by a stockholder activist, which resulted in significant costs to the Company. If a similar proposal were to be made again, the Company would likely incur significant costs, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Such proposals may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and divert the attention of the Company\u2019s management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, the perception that the Company needs a change in the direction of its business, or the perception that the Company is unstable or lacks continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. In addition, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 60986, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "NWL"}
