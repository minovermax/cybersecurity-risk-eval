{"cik": "1602367", "company": "Adeptus Health Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all, which could harm our growth and results of operations.\nOur growth depends on our ability to open profitable new facilities. Our growth strategy is to substantially grow the number of our freestanding emergency care facilities in 2015 and beyond. Our ability to open profitable facilities depends on many factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nopen facilities and achieve brand awareness in new markets;\n\u00b7\naccess capital to fund construction costs and preopening expenses;\n\u00b7\nmanage increases in costs, which could give rise to delays or cost overruns;\n\u00b7\nrecruit and train physicians, nurses and technicians in our local markets;\n\u00b7\nobtain all required governmental licenses and permits, including state facility licenses, on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\ncompete for appropriate sites in new markets, including against emergency care competitors and against traditional retailers; and\n\u00b7\nmaintain adequate information systems and other operational system capabilities.\nDelays in the opening of new facilities, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital constraints, difficulties resulting from commercial, residential and infrastructure development (or lack thereof) near our new facilities, difficulties in staffing and operating new locations or lack of acceptance in new market areas may negatively impact our new facility growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new facilities. Further, additional federal or state legislative or regulatory restrictions or licensure requirements could negatively impact our ability to operate both new and existing facilities.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to achieve our planned growth or, even if we are able to grow our facility base as planned, any new facilities may not be profitable or otherwise perform as planned. In addition, to the extent we have misjudged the nature and extent of industry trends or our competition, we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives. Failure to successfully implement our growth strategy would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur expansion into new markets presents increased risks and may require us to develop new business models.\nOur continued growth and profitability depend on our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy by expanding the number of facilities we operate in both new and existing markets. We cannot assure you our efforts to expand into new markets, particularly in states where we do not currently operate, will succeed. In order to operate in new markets, we may need to modify our existing business model and cost structure to comply with local regulatory or other requirements, which may expose us to new operational, regulatory or legal risks. In addition, expanding into new states, including our joint venture with Dignity Health and the opening of full-service general hospitals in Arizona and Texas (planned) in 2015, may subject us to unfamiliar or uncertain local regulations that may adversely affect our operations, for example, by impacting our insurance reimbursement practices or our ability to operate facilities as licensed or unlicensed freestanding emergency rooms or hospitals. See \u201c-Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation\u201d below. Facilities we open in new markets may also take longer to reach expected revenue and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than facilities we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer preferences and healthcare spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.\nWe may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified physicians, nurses, technicians and other personnel. We may need to augment our labor model to meet regulatory requirements and the overall cost of labor may be higher. As a result, these new facilities may be less successful and may not achieve target facility level profit margins at the same rate or at all. If any steps taken to expand our existing business model into new markets are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve our growth strategy and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites for our facilities and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets.\nOne of the key means of achieving our growth strategy will be through opening new facilities and operating those facilities on a profitable basis. We expect this to be the case for the foreseeable future. We identify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the location of our current facilities, demographics, traffic patterns and other factors that support our site-selection process. As we operate more facilities, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our current facility base will eventually decline. As of December 31, 2014, we had 55 facilities in operation. We have 12 locations currently under construction, including a regional hospital in Texas and 15 locations in the building permit process. Based on our typical development timeline we believe that at least 24 of these facilities will be completed and operational by December 31, 2015. We currently expect that 19 of the facilities will be funded by MPT under the MPT Agreements and the remaining facilities will be funded by other third party capital funding sources. Even though our 2015 expansion strategy is under way, the number and timing of new facilities opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and preopening expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe identification and availability of attractive sites for new facilities and the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms;\n\u00b7\nanticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity of potential sites to an existing facility;\n\u00b7\nconstruction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control construction and development costs incurred for projects, including those that are not pursued to completion;\n\u00b7\nhurricanes, floods, fires or other natural disasters that could adversely affect a project;\n\u00b7\ndefects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation; and\n\u00b7\ngovernmental restrictions on the nature and size of a project or timing of completion.\nIf we are unable to find and secure attractive locations to expand in existing markets or penetrate new markets, this may harm our ability to increase our revenues and profitability and realize our growth strategy and our financial results may be negatively affected.\nNew facilities, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in comparable facility revenue that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results.\nOur results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by a number of factors, including factors outside of our control, related to the opening of new facilities, including the timing of new facility openings, associated facility preopening costs and operating inefficiencies, as well as changes in our geographic concentration due to the opening of new facilities. We typically incur the most significant portion of opening expenses associated with a given facility within the first few months immediately preceding and following the opening of the facility. A new facility generally takes up to 12 months to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similar existing facilities due to lack of market awareness and other factors. We also may incur additional costs in new markets, particularly for contracting, real estate, labor, marketing and regional support, which may impact the profitability of those facilities. Accordingly, the volume and timing of new facility openings may have a meaningful impact on our profitability.\nAlthough we target specified operating and financial metrics, new facilities may not meet these targets or may take longer than anticipated to do so. Any new facilities we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing facilities. If our new facilities do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve expected comparable facility revenues, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOpening new facilities in existing markets may negatively affect revenue at our existing facilities.\nThe target area of our facilities varies by location and depends on a number of factors, including population density, other available emergency medical services, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new facility in or near markets in which we already have facilities could adversely affect the revenues of those existing facilities. Existing facilities could also make it more difficult to build our patient base for a new facility in the same market. Our business strategy does not entail opening new facilities that we believe will materially affect revenue at our existing facilities, but we may selectively open new facilities in and around areas of existing facilities that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our patients. Revenue cannibalization between our facilities may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our revenue growth, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are required to make capital expenditures, particularly to implement our growth strategy, in order to remain competitive.\nOur capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to identifying expansion opportunities for our facilities, the costs associated to establish such new facilities in existing and new markets and maintaining and upgrading our medical equipment to serve our customers and remain competitive. Our capital expenditures totaled $47.4 million , $46.0 million and $11.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition,\nchanging competitive conditions or the emergence of any significant advances in medical technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in new medical equipment, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on our Master Funding and Development Agreements with Medical Properties Trust to execute our expansion strategy.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, growing from 14 facilities at the end of 2012 to 26 facilities at the end of 2013, and to 55 facilities as of December 31, 2014. We have a robust pipeline under development designed to support the addition of a similar number of facilities in 2015. A major source of financing we have and employ to open new facilities is derived from our MPT Agreements. Under the terms of the MPT Agreements, MPT acquires parcels of land, funds the ground-up construction of new freestanding emergency room facilities and leases the facilities to us upon completion of construction. MPT is also required to fund all hard and soft costs, including the project purchase price, closing costs and pursuit costs for the assets relating to the construction of up to a maximum aggregate funding of $250.0 million, of which 89.4 million remained available under our Additional MPT Agreement as of December 31, 2014. An inability to rely on our relationship with MPT or to obtain alternate funding sources to fund our expansion strategies may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of the expansion of our current pipeline and future projects, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our expansion, and our inability to obtain such capital could harm our business.\nTo support our expansion strategy, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our new and existing facilities. Funding from outside financing or cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to allow us to sustain our expansion efforts. If funding from outside financing sources or cash flows from operations are not sufficient, we may need additional equity or debt financing to provide the funds required to expand our business. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. Debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results, and the documents governing indebtedness may contain covenants that restrict the operation of our business. Equity financing, or debt financing that is convertible into equity, could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, our inability to obtain adequate capital resources, whether in the form of equity or debt, to fund our business and growth strategies may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations or the expansion of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects.\nDamage to our reputation or our brand in existing or new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built our reputation on the high quality of our emergency medical services, physicians and operating personnel, as well as on our unique culture and the experience of our patients in our facilities, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to continue to be successful in the future. Our brand may be diminished if we do not continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for facility operations, equipment upgrades and staff training. Any incident, real or perceived, regardless of merit or outcome, that erodes our brand, such as, but not limited to, patient disability or death due to medical malpractice or allegations of medical malpractice, failure to comply with federal, state or local regulations including allegations or perceptions of non-compliance or failure to comply with ethical and operating standards, could significantly reduce the value of our brand, expose us to adverse publicity and damage our overall business and reputation. Further, our brand value could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if patients perceive a reduction in the quality of service or staff, or an adverse change in our culture, or otherwise believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive patient experience.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to grow.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the potential difficulties associated with growth, we may not be able to capture the efficiencies and opportunities that we expect from our expansion strategy. If we are not able to capture expected efficiencies of scale, maintain patient volumes, improve our systems and equipment, continue our cost discipline and retain appropriate physician and overall labor levels, our operating margins may stagnate or decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain patients. Our total marketing initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in costs of approximately $9.3 million, $5.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Our marketing activities are principally focused on increasing brand awareness and awareness of our service capabilities and our marketing team is responsible for implementing our marketing efforts through activating field marketing teams, underscoring leadership through brand-wide program initiatives, participating in trade show sponsorship, white paper publication, arranging for speaking engagements for our senior executives and formal training about our products and services. We also sponsor and host local community activities including fundraisers, street parties and sporting events to bolster our overall community involvement. As we open new facilities, we undertake aggressive marketing campaigns to increase community awareness about our growing presence. We plan to utilize targeted marketing efforts within local neighborhoods, through channels such as direct mail, mobile billboards, radio advertisements, television, community sponsorships and a robust online/social media presence. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenue. Our ability to market our services may be restricted or limited by federal or state law.\nWe face intense competition in the emergency care market, including competition for patients, strategic relationships and commercial payor contracts which could adversely affect our contract and revenue base.\nThe market for providing emergency care services is highly competitive and each of the individual geographic areas in which we operate has a different competitive landscape. We compete with national, regional and local enterprises, some of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them, greater access to physicians or greater access to potential customers. We may also compete with urgent care centers and physician-owned facilities for lower-acuity cases and with hospitals for higher acuity cases. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts, retain existing contracts and increase or maintain profit margins.\nIn each of our markets we compete with other healthcare providers for patients and in contracting with commercial payors. We are also in competition with other emergency care providers, hospitals, urgent care centers, clinics and healthcare systems in the communities we serve to attract patients and provide them with the care they need. There are hospitals and health systems that compete with us in each market in which we operate, and many of them have more established relationships with physicians and payors than we do. In addition, other companies are currently in the same or similar business of developing, acquiring and operating emergency care facilities, or may decide to enter this business. We also compete with some of these companies for entry into strategic relationships with health systems. As a result of the differing competitive factors within the markets in which we operate, the individual results of our facilities may be volatile. If we are unable to compete effectively with any of these entities or groups we may be unable to implement our business strategies successfully, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals with the qualifications and attributes we and our patients\u2019 desire.\nOur success depends upon our continuing ability to recruit and retain qualified physicians, nurses, technologists and other operating staff. There is currently a national shortage of certain of these healthcare professionals. To the extent that a significant number of physicians within an individual community or market decide to partner with competing\nemergency care providers, hospitals or health systems and not with us, we may not be able to operate our facilities in such community. We face competition for such personnel from emergency care providers and other organizations. This competition may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel. In the event we are unable to recruit and retain these professionals, such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow or be profitable.\nIf we are unable to negotiate and enter into favorable contracts or maintain satisfactory relationships and renew existing contracts on favorable terms with third-party payors, our revenue and profitability may decrease.\nWe estimate that 97.8%, 98.8% and 98.1%, of our net patient service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was derived from third-party payors such as managed care organizations, commercial insurance providers and employer-sponsored healthcare plans. We receive most of these payments from third-party payors that have contracts or other arrangements in place with us in Texas and Colorado. We currently have a contract in place with one significant commercial insurance provider and an arrangement with another organization that enables us to access third-party payors at in-network rates. These third-party payors use a variety of methods for reimbursement depending on the arrangement involved. These arrangements include fee-for-service, preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, as well as prepaid and discounted medical service packages and capitated (fixed fee) contracts. Rates for health maintenance organization benefit plans are typically lower than those for preferred provider organization or other benefit plans that offer broader provider access.\nThere is often pressure to renegotiate our reimbursement levels, including, in particular, in connection with changes to Medicare. Typically, third-party commercial payors reimburse us based upon contracted discounts to our established base rates. In 2012, we entered into a contract with another large third-party payor and implemented a price increase in May 2013 and May 2014 under that contract. To date, we have not experienced a shift toward payors who base reimbursement levels on Medicare rates. During the past three years, we have experienced a trend towards increasing reimbursement by third-party commercial payors. If managed care organizations and other third-party payors reduce their rates or we were to experience a significant shift in our revenue mix toward Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements, which we currently do not accept, but may accept in the future, then our revenue and profitability may decline and our operating margins will be reduced. Third-party payors continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among third-party payors tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Because some third-party payors rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, changes to government healthcare programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from third-party payors. Other healthcare providers may impact our ability to negotiate increases and other favorable terms in our reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with third-party payors or otherwise restrict the ability of third-party payors to contract with us or our health system partners. Our results of operations will depend, in part, on our and our health system partners, ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts as well as enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. Our inability to maintain suitable financial arrangements with third-party payors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs various provisions of PPACA are implemented, including the establishment of health insurance exchanges, quality-based reimbursement and bundled payments, third-party payors may increasingly demand reduced fees. In addition, there is a growing trend for third-party payors to take steps to shift the primary cost of care to the plan participant by increasing co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, and these actions could discourage such patients from seeking treatment at our facilities. Patient volumes could decrease if we or our health system partners are unable to enter into acceptable contracts with such third-party payors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on payments from a variety of third-party payors. If these payments are significantly delayed, are reduced or eliminated our revenue and profitability could decrease.\nWe depend upon compensation from third-party payors for the services provided to patients in our facilities. The amount that our facilities receive in payment for their services may be adversely affected by factors we do not control, including state regulatory changes, cost-containment decisions and changes in reimbursement schedules of\nthird-party payors and legislative changes. Any reduction or elimination of these payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. While we recognize revenue when healthcare services are provided, there can be delays before we receive payment. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage, that services provided were not medically necessary, that services rendered in our facilities did not require emergency level care or that additional supporting documentation is necessary. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors. Delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable, increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs.\nSignificant changes in our payor mix or acuity mix resulting from fluctuations in the types of patients seen at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results may change from period to period due to fluctuations in payor mix or acuity mix or other factors relating to the type of treatment performed by physicians at our facilities. Payor mix refers to the relative share of total cases provided to patients with, respectively, no insurance, commercial insurance and other coverage. Since, generally speaking, we receive relatively higher payment rates from third-party payors than self-pay patients, a significant shift in our payor mix toward a higher percentage of self-pay or Medicare, Medicaid or other government reimbursement program patients, which we do not currently accept, but may accept in the future, which could occur for reasons beyond our control, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Acuity mix refers to the relative share of total visits by acuity level, which affects the costs of the services we provide as well as the related revenue. Generally speaking, we derive relatively higher revenue from more complex treatments and patient encounters. Therefore, a significant shift in our acuity mix toward a higher percentage of lower revenue treatments could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a negative impact on our net revenues, bad debt expense and cash flow.\nBilling for our services is complex. The practice of providing medical services in advance of payment or prior to assessing a patient\u2019s ability to pay for such services may have a significant negative impact on our patient service revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow. We bill numerous and varied payors, including self-pay patients and various forms of commercial insurance providers. Different payors typically have differing forms of billing requirements that must be met prior to receiving payment for services rendered. Self-pay patients and third-party payors may fail to pay for services even if they have been properly billed. Reimbursement to us is typically conditioned, among other things, on our providing the proper procedure and diagnosis codes. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information could result in non-payment for services rendered.\nAdditional factors that could complicate our billing include:\n\u00b7\ndisputes between payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u00b7\nvariation in coverage for similar services among various payors;\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements, coding and various other procedures mandated by responsible parties;\n\u00b7\nthe fact that we bill payors a facility fee, a professional services fee and other related fees;\n\u00b7\nthe transition to new coding standards, which will require significantly more information than the codes currently used for medical coding and will require covered entities to code with much greater detail and specificity; and\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain proper physician enrollment and documentation in order to bill various payors.\nTo the extent the complexity associated with billing for our services causes delays in our cash collections, we assume the financial risk of increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the increased potential for bad debt expense.\nOur relationships with health systems are important to our growth strategy. If we fail to maintain good relationships with these health systems or to enter into new relationships, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy successfully and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends in part upon the success of our health system partners and the strength of our relationships with those health systems. Our business could be adversely affected by any damage to those health systems\u2019 reputation or to our relationships with them, or as a result of an irreconcilable dispute with a health system partner. Additionally, our reputation in the communities we serve is bolstered by our relationships with our partners. If we are unable to maintain such partnerships, our own reputation could be adversely affected. We may enter into affiliation agreements or have informal arrangements with health systems in which we agree to transfer certain patients to affiliated hospitals in a defined geographic area. We expect to focus on the creation of additional partnerships with health systems, and others, as part of expansion strategy. For example, we have arrangements with HCA to ensure bed availability for our patients in need of acute care services at nearby HCA hospitals in both the North Texas and Houston areas. In addition, we have a relationship with the Concentra urgent care clinics in the Dallas/Fort Worth market, whereby we are able to refer workers\u2019 compensation patients to Concentra when follow-up, non-emergent, care is needed. If we are unable to develop and maintain good relationships with such health systems, maintain our existing agreements on terms and conditions favorable to us or enter into relationships with additional health systems on favorable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our growth strategies successfully.\nWe may enter into partnerships with healthcare providers. If this strategy is not successful, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, we have entered into strategic business partnerships with hospital systems and other large providers to take advantage of commercial opportunities in our facility based business. For example, and as discussed above, we have agreements with HCA and Concentra to ensure that patients have direct access to nearby hospitals and urgent care centers, as necessary. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful.\nMoreover, this strategic partnership model exposes us to commercial risks that may be different from our own business model, including that the success of such partnerships is only partially under our operational and legal control, the potential for opportunity costs in not being able to pursue other partnerships should we enter into exclusive arrangements, and the risk that our partners may enter into additional arrangements with our competitors if these arrangements are not exclusive. Furthermore, partnership arrangements may raise fraud and abuse issues. For example, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG, has taken the position that certain contractual arrangements between a party that receives remuneration for making referrals and a party that receives referrals for a specific type of service may violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, if one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage referrals. Our strategic partnership agreements do not involve the payment of any compensation. We believe our strategic partnership arrangements comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, other regulatory bodies or a court may interpret these agreements differently and there is a risk that we may be found non-compliant and subject to government investigation, private and public lawsuits, civil penalties and criminal sanctions. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Anti-Kickback Statute and-State Laws Regarding Prohibition of Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Arrangements.\u201d\nProposed changes to financial accounting standards could require our operating leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.\nIn addition to our significant level of indebtedness, we have considerable obligations relating to our current capital and operating leases. Proposed changes to financial accounting standards could require such leases to be recognized on our balance sheet. All of our existing facilities are subject to leases. All facilities under the MPT Agreements have initial terms of 15 years, with three five-year renewal options. The terms of our non-MPT facilities vary, but typically have initial terms of between five and seven years with three-year to five-year renewal options. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had 54 and 25 leased facilities, 53 and 24 of which were classified as operating leases and one of which was classified as a capital lease, respectively. The accounting treatment of these leases is described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our operating lease expense was approximately $14.6 million, 4.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nIn May 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board issued a revised joint discussion paper highlighting proposed changes to financial accounting standards for leases. The proposed changes would require that substantially all operating leases be recognized as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, which would be a significant departure from the current standard, which classifies operating leases as off-balance sheet transactions and accounts for only the current year operating lease expense in the statement of operations. The right to use the leased property would be capitalized as an asset and the expected lease payments over the life of the lease would be accounted for as a liability. The effective date, which has not been determined, could be as early as 2016 and may require retrospective adoption. While we have not quantified the impact this proposed standard would have on our financial statements, if our current operating leases are instead recognized on the balance sheet, it will result in a significant increase in the liabilities reflected on our balance sheet and in the interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense reflected in our statement of operations, while reducing the amount of rent expense. This could potentially decrease our reported net income.\nA successful challenge by tax authorities to our treatment of certain physicians as independent contractors or the elimination of an existing safe harbor could materially increase our costs relating to these physicians.\nAs of December 31, 2014, through National Medical Professionals of Texas PLLC, National Medical Professionals of Colorado, P.C. and National Medical Professionals of Arizona LLC, affiliated professional limited liability companies owned and operated by our Executive Medical Director, we contracted with approximately 434 physicians and other medical staff as independent contractors to fulfill our contractual obligations to customers. Because these staff members are treated as independent contractors rather than as employees, National Medical Professionals of Texas PLLC, National Medical Professionals of Colorado, P.C. and National Medical Professionals of Arizona LLC do not (i) withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes from their compensation, (ii) make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments with respect to them, (iii) provide workers compensation insurance with respect to them (except in states where they are required to do so for independent contractors), or (iv) allow them to participate in benefits and retirement programs available to employees. The contracts in place with these physicians obligate them to pay these taxes and other costs. Whether these physicians are properly classified as independent contractors generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of our relationship with them. If a challenge to our treatment of these physicians as independent contractors by federal or state authorities were successful and these physicians were treated as employees instead of independent contractors, we and/or National Medical Professionals of Texas PLLC, National Medical Professionals of Colorado, P.C. and National Medical Professionals of Arizona LLC could be liable for taxes, penalties and interest. In addition, there are currently, and have been in the past, proposals made to eliminate an existing safe harbor that would potentially protect us from the imposition of taxes in these circumstances, and similar proposals could be made in the future. If such a challenge were successful or if the safe harbor were eliminated, this could cause a material increase in our costs relating to these physicians and, therefore, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced net losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of net losses, including net losses of approximately $17.3 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our revenue may not grow and we may not\nachieve or maintain profitability in the future. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our ability to achieve profitability will be affected by the other risks and uncertainties described in this section and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d If we are not able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability, our business will be materially adversely affected and the price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nWe depend on our senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nWe depend on our senior management, including Thomas Hall, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Fielding, our Chief Financial Officer, and Graham Cherrington, our President and Chief Operating Officer. We rely on the extensive experience of our management team across the healthcare, retail and hospitality sectors as well as extensive knowledge of healthcare operations and facility expansion. The loss of services of any of these or any other members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nOur business depends on numerous complex information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on complex, integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational and financial information and our billing operations. We may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our increased patient volume and changing needs. Furthermore, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications and expenses in implementing, integrating and operating our systems. Any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation would adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and process billing information in a timely manner, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and delayed cash flow. In addition, our technology systems, or a disruption in the operation of such systems, could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The failure to successfully implement and maintain operational, financial and billing information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business, retain existing business and maintain or increase our profit margins.\nOur facilities currently located in Texas, Colorado and Arizona make us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic and other conditions in those states.\nOur facilities are currently located in Texas, Colorado and Arizona. If there were an adverse regulatory, economic or other development in any of these states, our patient volume could decline, our ability to operate our facilities under our existing business model could be impacted, or there could be other unanticipated adverse impacts on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related To Healthcare Regulation-Changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements, including due to political discord in the budgeting process outside our control, may adversely affect our revenue and operations.\u201d\nOur patient volumes are sensitive to seasonal fluctuations and patient concerns over outbreaks and other infectious diseases, which impact our results of operations.\nOur patient volumes are sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in emergency activity. Typically, winter months see a higher occurrence of influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia and similar illnesses; however the timing and severity of these outbreaks can vary dramatically. Our patient volumes are influenced by fluctuations in the demand for our healthcare services and are sensitive to patient concerns over pandemic outbreaks such as Ebola and other infectious diseases, including patient concerns over the possibility of acquiring or communicating such diseases in a medical care environment. Additionally, as consumers shift towards high deductible insurance plans, they are responsible for a greater percentage of their bill, particularly in the early months of the year before other healthcare spending has occurred, which may lead to an increase in bad debt expense during that period. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on these and other factors.\nOur ability to open and operate facilities may be impacted by weather conditions.\nOur construction timelines may be delayed due to weather conditions. This may prevent us from opening facilities on time and increase our preopening expense burden. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters could also severely hinder our ability to operate existing facilities, delay capital improvements or cause us to close facilities. For example, in 2014, 38.5% of our patient service revenue was generated from facilities in the Houston market. If a hurricane, or other severe weather, were to affect this market, it could impact our ability to operate these facilities.\nDisruptions in our disaster recovery systems or management continuity planning could limit our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWhile we have disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans in place, any disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be adversely affected.\nWe could be subject to lawsuits for which we are not fully reserved.\nPhysicians, hospitals, clinics and other participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring, supervision and credentialing. Some of these lawsuits may involve large claim amounts and substantial defense costs. We generally procure professional liability insurance coverage for our affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities. As of December 31, 2014, our professional liability insurance coverage was $20 million. This insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a cost satisfactory to us to allow for the maintenance of adequate levels of insurance. If one or more successful claims against us were not covered by or exceeded the coverage of our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the normal course of our business, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, including those arising out of our billing and marketing practices, employment disputes, contractual claims and other business disputes for which we may have no insurance coverage, and which are not subject to actuarial estimates. The outcome of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period when we identify the matter, and the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe reserves we establish with respect to our losses not covered under our insurance programs are subject to inherent uncertainties.\nIn connection with our insurance programs, we establish reserves for losses and related expenses, which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration costs of losses we have incurred in respect of our liability risks. Insurance reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. Our reserves are based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent actuary firm. The independent actuary firm performs studies of projected ultimate losses on an annual basis and provides quarterly updates to those projections. We use these actuarial estimates to determine appropriate reserves. Our reserves could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While we monitor claims closely when we estimate reserves, the complexity of the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes may hamper timely adjustments to the assumptions we use in these estimates. Actual losses and related expenses may deviate, individually and in the aggregate, from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a reserve of approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million for incurred but unreported health claims, respectively. If we determine that our estimated reserves are inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves at the time of the determination, which would result in a reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is determined.\nInsurance coverage for some of our losses may be inadequate and may be subject to the credit risk of commercial insurance providers.\nOur insurance coverage is through various third-party insurers. To the extent we hold policies to cover certain groups of claims or rely on insurance coverage obtained by third parties to cover such claims, but either we or such third parties did not obtain sufficient insurance limits, did not buy an extended reporting period policy, where applicable, or the issuing insurance company is unable or unwilling to pay such claims, we may be responsible for those losses. Furthermore, for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance providers, we are subject to the \u201ccredit risk\u201d of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance providers are currently creditworthy, they may not remain so in the future.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and, if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services, our contractual relationships with our physicians, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with these laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment loss of enrollment status and exclusion from government healthcare programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to multiple interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements\u2019 attention from the operation of our business.\nOur physicians, nurses and technicians, as well as the third-party payors with which we have a relationship are also subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation agencies. Compliance with these guidelines and standards is often required by our contracts with our customers or to maintain our reputation.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. New or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nOur current facilities are subject to state statutes and regulations that govern our operations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur operating freestanding emergency room facilities in Texas and Colorado, and our hospital in Arizona, are subject to many laws and regulations, particularly at the state and local government levels. These laws and regulations require our freestanding emergency rooms and our hospital in Arizona to meet various licensing, certification and other requirements, including those relating to:\n\u00b7\nbuilding and construction codes, fire codes and life safety standards for our facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe qualifications of medical and support personnel in our facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\nrequired governance boards and organizational plans to oversee the facility;\n\u00b7\nrequired services and treatment lines, particularly in the hospital setting;\n\u00b7\nfacility licensure;\n\u00b7\nmaintenance and protection of medical records;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental protection, health and safety, including the handling and disposal of medical waste;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of infection control and quality improvement policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\nrequired operating hours;\n\u00b7\nrequirements to treat our emergent patients regardless of ability to pay;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on advertising and billing with respect to patients to make clear the facility is operating as an emergency room; and\n\u00b7\npatient transfer agreements and patient transfer plans to care for patients of an acuity beyond the capability of the facility.\nWe may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if our operations or facilities are found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations. Further, these laws and regulations are subject to change. New regulation of such facilities is also possible, which could force us to change our operational approach or lead to a finding by regulators that our facilities do not meet legal requirements.\nState law regulation of construction or expansion of emergency rooms could prevent us from developing additional freestanding emergency rooms or other facilities.\nThirty-six states have certificate of need programs that require some level of prior approval for the construction of a new facility, acquisition or expansion of an existing facility, or the addition of new services for various healthcare facilities. One of the most common categories of healthcare services reviewed under certificate of need laws is hospital services, which may include the emergency services we provide at our freestanding emergency rooms. While the states where our facilities are currently operational (Texas, Colorado and Arizona) do not require a certificate of need, other states where we seek to expand our operations may require certificates of need under circumstances not currently applicable to our facilities. If these states require such a certificate, they may examine any proposed facility for the cost of adding additional services compared with other treatment models, the impact of our proposed facility on existing providers, the need for additional or expanded healthcare services in the relevant market and other analysis that may\nrequire changes to our business model. In such case, we may not be able to obtain the necessary certificates of need or other required approvals to meet our expansion plans. In addition, if we seek to acquire other facilities, in certificate of need states, we may be required to obtain a certificate of need before the acquisition, before we replace the equipment or before we expand the acquired facility. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, we may not be able to move forward with a planned acquisition, expand the acquired facility, add additional services to the facility or replace its equipment.\nIn addition, there is a significant risk of additional state legislation restricting our ability to obtain licensure for new facilities. Only a few states, including Texas and Colorado, currently license the freestanding emergency room facilities that we operate. The lack of a specific licensure process for freestanding emergency facilities may lead state legislators or regulators to aggressively regulate the growth of such facilities, potentially seeking to treat our freestanding emergency room facilities in a manner similar to hospitals. In other states, the growing number of freestanding emergency departments may lead state legislatures to pass legislation requiring us to substantially change our operations or cease our operations in that state entirely. Any such licensure challenges could materially impact our prospects and growth strategy.\nAlternatively, without current state licensure of freestanding emergency room facilities, we may need to develop new models or form partnerships with existing facilities to expand to new states. Such challenges were one reason we entered into a joint venture with Dignity Health announced in October 2014. The new partnership has started with Dignity Health Arizona General Hospital, which is licensed as a general hospital by the Arizona Department of Health Services. These alternative models or partnerships may not be as profitable as our current freestanding facilities, and such development may materially impact our prospects or our growth strategy.\nWe are subject to comprehensive and complex laws and rules that govern the manner in which we bill and are paid for our services by third-party payors, and the failure to comply with these rules, or allegations that we have failed to do so, can result in civil or criminal sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.\nSubstantially all of our services are paid for by third-party commercial payors. These third-party payors typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must meet in order to receive payment for our services. Reimbursement is typically conditioned on our providing the correct procedure and diagnostic codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, the medical necessity for the services, the site of service, and the identity of the physician, nurse or technician who provided the service.\nWe must also comply with numerous other state and federal laws applicable to our documentation and the claims we submit for payment, including but not limited to (i) \u201ccoordination of benefits\u201d rules that dictate which payor we must bill first when a patient has potential coverage from multiple payors, (ii) requirements that we obtain the signature of the patient or patient representative, or, in certain cases, alternative documentation, prior to submitting a claim, (iii) requirements that we make repayment within a specified period of time to any payor which pays us more than the amount to which we are entitled, (iv) \u201creassignment\u201d rules governing our ability to bill and collect professional fees on behalf of our physicians, (v) requirements that our electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats and (vi) laws requiring us to handle all health and financial information of our patients in a manner that complies with specified security and privacy standards.\nPrivate third-party payors carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these and other applicable rules. Our failure to comply with the billing and other rules applicable to us could result in non-payment for services rendered or refunds of amounts previously paid for such services.\nAdditionally, on January 16, 2009, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which includes our facilities must implement the International Classification of Diseases (10th Edition), or ICD-10, for medical coding on October 1, 2013. HHS subsequently postponed the deadline for implementation of ICD-10 codes until October 1, 2014, which Congress extended until October 1, 2015, as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. ICD-10 codes contain significantly more information than the ICD-9 codes currently used for medical coding and will require covered entities to code with much greater detail and specificity than ICD-9 codes. However, the transition to ICD-10 does not affect\nCurrent Procedural Terminology coding for physician services or outpatient procedures. We may incur additional costs for computer system updates, training, and other resources required to implement these changes. We may also incur additional costs from further delays in training staff on both the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and maintaining software that can operate under both systems through the inherent uncertainty from ongoing delays it ICD-10 implementation.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of these or any of the other laws which govern our activities, any resulting penalties, damages, fines or other sanctions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nChanges in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements, including due to political discord in the budgeting process outside our control, may adversely affect our revenue and operations.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from direct billings to patients and third-party payors. As a result, any changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. Reimbursement rates can vary depending on whether the facility provider is an in-network or out-of-network provider. Each of our facilities will be out-of-network for some patients. Some facilities, as an out-of-network provider, may have issues billing appropriately with certain third-party payors. In some states, we may rely on state law that requires reimbursement of our services at in-network rates. A change in state law where the majority of our facilities are operated could have a material effect on our revenue or force us to negotiate lower rates with third-party payors who may or may not be willing to enter into agreements with us. In the last legislative session, members of the Colorado legislature proposed but did not pass a bill which would have significantly reduced reimbursement rates for our facilities within the state by making it a violation of the state insurance code to bill insurers or their beneficiaries for facility fees. We cannot predict the outcome of any legislation and cannot assure you that the Colorado legislature or another state where we operate would not pass another law that damages our ability to operate under our current model.\nAdditionally, PPACA could ultimately result in substantial changes in coverage and reimbursement, including changes in coverage or amounts paid by private payors, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue from those sources.\nRecent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending could adversely affect our business model, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. In March 2010, the President signed PPACA into law, which made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. However, certain provisions in PPACA, such as the establishment of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, could cause us to face negative reimbursement rates that would adversely affect our business model.\nPPACA may also adversely affect payors by increasing their medical cost trends, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas, although the extent of this impact is currently unknown.\nBecause of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of PPACA, including litigation pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of PPACA on our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We also anticipate that Congress and state legislatures may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation.\nIf current or future laws or regulations force us to restructure our arrangements with physicians, professional corporations and hospitals, we may incur additional costs, lose contracts and suffer a reduction in net revenue under existing contracts, and we may need to refinance our debt or obtain debt holder consent.\nA number of laws bear on our relationships with our physicians. State authorities in some jurisdictions could find that our contractual relationships with our physicians violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting. These laws are generally intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment, but they may also prevent the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. Approximately 30 states have some form of corporate practice of medicine restrictions and as we continue to expand into new markets, our current business model may implicate these restrictions. The states in which we currently operate (Colorado, Texas and Arizona) have some level of corporate practice of medicine restrictions. In each of these states, a business corporation may not employ physicians or provide medical services. While we believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable state laws relating to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are impermissibly engaged in the practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee-splitting. In this event, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physicians and physician groups.\nOur physician contracts include contracts with individual physicians and with physicians organized as separate legal professional entities (e.g., professional medical corporations). Antitrust laws may deem each such physician/entity to be separate, both from us and from each other, and, accordingly, each such physician/practice would be subject to a wide range of laws that prohibit anti-competitive conduct between or among separate legal entities or individuals. A review or action by regulatory authorities or the courts could force us to terminate or modify our contractual relationships with physicians and affiliated medical groups, or to revise them in a manner that could be materially adverse to our business.\nVarious licensing and certification laws, regulations and standards apply to us, our affiliated physicians and our relationships with our affiliated physicians. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non-reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupment, and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties, including loss of licensure for the facility. We routinely take actions we believe are necessary to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities, including all building codes, state licensure rules and all state-mandated services. While we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them, agencies that administer these programs may find that we have failed to comply in some material respects. Further, any expansion in new states or participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs may add additional licensing and certification requirements with which we may not be in full compliance today.\nAdverse judicial or administrative interpretations could result in a finding that we are not in compliance with one or more of these laws and rules that affect our relationships with our physicians.\nThese laws and rules, and their interpretations, may also change in the future. Any adverse interpretations or changes could force us to restructure our relationships with physicians, professional corporations or our hospital systems, or to restructure our operations. This could cause our operating costs to increase significantly. A restructuring could also result in a loss of contracts or a reduction in revenue under existing contracts. Moreover, if we are required to modify our structure and organization to comply with these laws and rules, our financing agreements may prohibit such modifications and require us to obtain the consent of the holders of such debt or require the refinancing of such debt.\nWe are subject to the data privacy, security and breach notification requirements of HIPAA and other data privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with these rules, or allegations that we have failed to do so, can result in civil or criminal sanctions.\nHIPAA required HHS to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of certain health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the grant of certain rights to patients with respect to such information by \u201ccovered entities.\u201d As a provider of healthcare who conducts certain electronic transactions, each of our facilities is considered a covered entity under HIPAA. We have taken actions to comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations and believe that we are in substantial compliance with those regulations. These actions include the creation and implementation of policies and procedures, staff training, execution of HIPAA-compliant contractual arrangements with certain service providers and various other measures. Ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time, effort and expense.\nIn addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health-related information received, maintained, or transmitted by covered entities or their business associates. We have taken actions in an effort to be in compliance with these security regulations and believe that we are in substantial compliance, however, a security incident that bypasses our information security systems causing an information security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws or a material disruption of our operational systems could result in a material adverse impact on our business, along with fines. Ongoing implementation and oversight of these security measures involves significant time, effort and expense.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, as implemented in part by an omnibus final rule published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2013, further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information, or PHI, that compromises the privacy or security of such information. HHS has established the presumption that all unauthorized uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information constitute breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. HITECH and implementing regulations specify that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported immediately to HHS, which will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS of such breaches at least annually. These breach notification requirements apply not only to unauthorized disclosures of unsecured PHI to outside third parties, but also to unauthorized internal access to or use of such PHI.\nHITECH significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and increased penalties for violations. Currently, violations of the HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification standards may result in civil penalties ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.5 million in the aggregate for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. The amount of penalty that may be assessed depends, in part, upon the culpability of the applicable covered entity or business associate in committing the violation. Some penalties for certain violations that were not due to \u201cwillful neglect\u201d may be waived by the Secretary of HHS in whole or in part, to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be excessive relative to the violation. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of residents of their states. Applicable courts may able to award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. HITECH also mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of a cross-section of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. Every covered entity and business associate is subject to being audited, regardless of the entity\u2019s compliance record.\nStates may impose more protective privacy restrictions in laws related to health information and may afford individuals a private right of action with respect to the violation of such laws. Both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy protection at any time. We are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional requirements on us and more severe penalties for disclosures of health information. Texas, Colorado and Arizona each have privacy regulations that impose requirements and restrictions in addition to those under HIPAA. If we\nfail to comply with HIPAA or similar state laws, including laws addressing data confidentiality, security or breach notification, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and our reputation.\nIn addition, states may also impose restrictions related to the confidentiality of personal information that is not considered \u201cprotected health information\u201d under HIPAA. Such information may include certain identifying information and financial information of our patients. Theses state laws may impose additional notification requirements in the event of a breach of such personal information. Failure to comply with such data confidentiality, security and breach notification laws may result in substantial monetary penalties.\nIn January 2015, we submitted an enrollment application for our Arizona general hospital to participate in the federal Medicare program and the Arizona Medicaid program. As a result of participating in these programs, we will be required to comply with a number of additional federal and state regulatory schemes.\nWhile the majority of our facilities do not currently participate as providers in the federal Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare programs, our hospital in Arizona recently submitted enrollment applications to participate in these programs. Our Arizona hospital received confirmation of its enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid as of January 30, 2015. By enrolling in these programs, we will face certain federal and state regulatory schemes for the first time. For example, the federal physician self-referral law (or the Stark Law) and the Anti-Kickback Statute apply to the provision of healthcare services and supplies to Medicare and Medicaid patients. While we have sought to organize our operations-both at our freestanding emergency rooms that do not participate in these programs and at our newly-opened hospital in Arizona-to comply with both the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute, we cannot assure you that our enrollment in these government programs will not require some reorganization of our existing relationships with our physicians, referral sources and other partners, or that we will not be subject to government investigation for failure to comply with these laws.\nBy not participating in these programs at our freestanding emergency rooms, many potential consumers of our services in our target markets may choose to receive services from other providers. To participate in these programs at our freestanding emergency room facilities we would need to significantly modify our current operational model. Such programs, particularly Medicare, have substantial statutory and regulatory requirements to participate. For example, the Medicare program does not currently allow the participation of independent freestanding emergency room facilities. To participate as a Medicare provider in states where we operate only freestanding emergency rooms, we would need to open a central-hospital facility that owns and operates the satellite freestanding emergency rooms as \u201cprovider-based facilities\u201d under a unified organization. Under Medicare, establishing such a central-hospital facility with satellite freestanding emergency rooms structure requires a hospital to be \u201cprimarily engaged in the provision of services to inpatients.\u201d This requirement could limit our ability to grow by restricting the number of additional freestanding facilities associated with each Medicare-certified hospital to ensure compliance with the inpatient service requirements. This and other Medicare conditions of participation could be costly and limit our expansion plans. Our current accreditation from The Joint Commission as freestanding emergency room facilities does not guarantee that our facilities would meet The Joint Commission hospital standards, Medicare conditions of participation or Medicaid requirements for hospitals.\nFurthermore, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are particularly susceptible to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, spending freezes, federal and state funding reductions and administrative rulings and interpretations concerning, without limitation, patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements, all of which we now face for the first time at our Arizona hospital. PPACA reduces annual payment updates for certain providers, including hospitals, and reduces Medicare payments for certain procedures, such as readmissions and hospital-acquired infections. Furthermore, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions for each fiscal year through 2021. We are unable to predict how these spending reductions will be structured, what other deficit reduction initiatives may be adopted by the U.S. Congress or how these changes will impact our Arizona general hospital or would impact our freestanding emergency room facilities if we enrolled those facilities in the Medicare program.\nEnrolling as a Medicaid provider also subjects a portion of our revenue to fluctuations and limitations in state budgets. Many state legislatures, including Arizona, Colorado and Texas, are required by their state constitution or laws to balance the state\u2019s budgets annually and the Medicaid program is often the largest budget expenditure for many states. In recent years, as economic forces put pressure on state budgets, many states decreased spending or decreased spending growth for their Medicaid programs. States also continually review and revise their Medicaid programs and request waivers from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from otherwise national requirements, which could result in certain payments being reduced or eliminated. Such spending changes could have a material impact on the performance of our Arizona general hospital and our freestanding emergency rooms, if such facilities participate in state Medicaid programs.\nWhile our hospital in Arizona operates as a licensed general hospital under Arizona law and has received Joint Commission accreditation, until we receive our Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements we cannot guarantee that this hospital will participate in either program. Such an outcome could have a negative effect on the profitability of this facility since it was designed with the intent for the hospital to be Medicare-certified and participate in government programs.\nState regulation of healthcare marketing in our current or target markets could impact our marketing efforts, which may in turn hamper our ability to increase patient volume, increase same store sales, or build awareness of our care model, particularly if we choose to participate in Medicaid in the future.\nSome states regulate healthcare providers\u2019 marketing efforts to persons enrolled in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d). These marketing restrictions may impact our future marketing efforts. In particular, some state laws prohibit direct and/or indirect marketing and outreach efforts to enrollees of state-funded governmental healthcare programs. Some states restrict the direct marketing activities of providers by prohibiting providers from engaging in unsolicited personal contact or promotions of their practices to enrollees. In states that restrict providers\u2019 marketing efforts directly, regulations sometimes prohibit provider marketing materials from containing any false, misleading, or inaccurate statements relating to the providers\u2019 services, benefits or costs. A number of states also prohibit provider marketing materials from containing any state-owned logos or making any statement of endorsement by federal or state governmental entities.\nOther states, including Arizona, restrict providers\u2019 marketing efforts indirectly by regulating the activities of health plans that contract with state-funded governmental healthcare programs. Some states require state-contracted health plans to report their marketing costs to state regulatory agencies and submit all marketing materials for prior regulatory approval. We are not classified as a health plan, but we may contract with state-contracted health plans as a subcontracted provider subject to such restrictions in the future. In such case, some states\u2019 state-contracted health plans may restrict our marketing activities, in order to ensure the health plans\u2019 compliance with state-funded governmental healthcare programs\u2019 marketing restrictions. For example, a number of state-contracted health plans require their subcontracted providers to submit all marketing materials to the health plan. If the health plan deems it necessary, the health plan may then submit the subcontracted providers\u2019 marketing materials to the appropriate state regulatory agency. To our knowledge, we are currently in compliance with state healthcare marketing laws in the states in which we operate. However, these restrictions are rapidly evolving and we may be required to change our practices in the future. This risk is more pronounced in Arizona where we are enrolling our hospital in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, and such risks may increase in other states if we choose to enroll our facilities in those state\u2019s Medicaid programs.\nOur facilities, billing practices, relationships with healthcare providers and third parties, and our marketing practices are (at least in part) subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, False Claims Act and similar state laws.\nIn enrolling in the federal Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare programs, our Arizona hospital (and any other of our facilities that enroll in such programs in the future) is directly subject to additional federal laws, including, but not limited to, those discussed below.\nAnti-Kickback Statute\nProvisions in Title XI of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states such as Texas and Arizona have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services reimbursed by a governmental health program or state Medicaid. Some of these state prohibitions apply to remuneration for referrals of healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payor, including private payors.\nEven at facilities where we do not currently accept Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare reimbursement, we could still be subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute to the extent we have referral or financial relationships with other parties that do participate in those programs.\nViolations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, such as $25,000 per violation and up to three times the remuneration involved. We may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims, and may also require us to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA. The obligations contained in such CIA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStark Law\nThe Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring a patient to a healthcare provider for certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare if the physician (or close family members) has a financial relationship with that provider, including an investment interest, a loan or debt relationship or a compensation relationship. The designated health services covered by the law include, among others, hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, laboratory and imaging services. Some states, including Texas and Colorado, have self-referral laws similar to Stark Law for Medicaid claims (and commercial claims). States such as Arizona and Texas also require physicians to disclose to their patients that they have a direct financial relationship in a separate diagnostic or treatment agency or in services and goods being prescribed.\nViolation of the Stark Law may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, a refund of any Medicare payments for services that resulted from an unlawful referral, $15,000 civil monetary penalties for specified infractions, criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and potential false claims liability. The repayment provisions in the Stark Law are not dependent on the parties having an improper intent; rather, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute and any violation is subject to repayment of all tainted referrals. If physician self-referral laws are interpreted differently or if other legislative restrictions are issued, we could incur significant sanctions and loss of revenues, or we could have to change our arrangements and operations in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFalse Claims Act\nThe federal government is authorized to impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on any person or entity that files a false claim for payment from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. False claims filed with private insurers can also lead to criminal and civil penalties under state law. While the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances of fraudulent intent, the government applies criminal, civil and administrative penalty statutes to a range of circumstances, including coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, submitting claims resulting from arrangements prohibited by the Stark Law or the Anti-Kickback Statute, billing for services not rendered in compliance with complex Medicare and Medicaid regulations and guidance, misrepresenting services rendered\n(e.g., miscoding, upcoding, etc.) and application for duplicate reimbursement. Additionally, the federal government has taken the position that claiming reimbursement for unnecessary or substandard services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary or substandard. Criminal penalties also are available in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate a number of federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.\nUnder the \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, private parties (\u201crelators\u201d or \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d) may bring actions against providers on behalf of the federal government. Such private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government through trial or settlement. Qui tam cases are sealed by the court at the time of filing. The only parties privy to the information contained in the complaint are the relator, the federal government and the presiding court. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically.\nBoth direct enforcement activity by the government and whistleblower lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk of healthcare companies like us having to defend a false claims action, repay claims paid by the government, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, under PPACA, providers must report and refund the overpayments before the later of 60 days after the overpayment was identified or the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. Any overpayment that is retained after this deadline is considered an obligation subject to an action under the Federal False Claims Act.\nA number of states have enacted false claims acts that are applicable to claims submitted to state Medicaid programs and are similar to the Federal False Claims Act. Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 as amended, or DRA, amended federal law to encourage these types of state laws, along with a corresponding increase in state initiated false claims enforcement efforts. Currently, most states and the District of Columbia have some form of state false claims act. As of January 16, 2015, the OIG has reviewed 28 of these laws and determined that 18 of these laws satisfy the DRA standards, including Texas, Arizona and Colorado. Several states were given a grace period to amend their false claims acts to come into compliance with recent amendments to the Federal False Claims Act. We anticipate this figure will continue to increase.\nRecovery Audit Program of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\nWe believe that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue to operate its Recovery Audit Program, which could randomly audit our Arizona hospital and any other facilities that enroll in the Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare programs in the future. The Recovery Audit Program\u2019s mission is to identify and correct Medicare improper payments through the efficient detection and collection of overpayments made on claims of healthcare services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, and the identification of underpayments to providers so that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can implement actions that will prevent future improper payments. Federal law also requires states to create Recovery Audit Programs for their state Medicaid programs. Enrollment in Arizona\u2019s and other states\u2019 Medicaid programs may mean additional state scrutiny of potential overpayments.\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act\nOur participation in Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare at our Arizona hospital subjects the hospital to certain requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. Under EMTALA, all participating hospitals with emergency departments are required to provide an appropriate medical screening examination upon request by any individual to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists or if the patient is in active labor. If the hospital determines that there is an emergency medical condition, then the hospital must stabilize the individual. Violations of these EMTALA obligations (if applicable) could subject us to civil penalties. Furthermore, individuals have a private right of enforcement if they suffer harm that is a direct result of a violation of EMTALA.\nOur facilities are subject to state requirements similar to those of EMTALA, regardless of whether our facilities are enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare. For example, in Texas, as freestanding emergency room facilities, we are required by state law to provide appropriate screening and examinations to individuals to determine if an emergency\nmedical condition exists. The facilities are also required to provide the necessary stabilizing treatment without assessing the individual\u2019s ability to pay. Violations of these requirements could lead to administrative and criminal penalties.\nChanges in our ownership structure and operations may require us to comply with numerous notification and reapplication requirements in order to maintain our licenses, certifications or other authorizations to operate, and failure to do so, or an allegation that we have failed to do so, could result in payment delays, forfeiture of payment or civil and criminal penalties.\nWe and our contracted physicians are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws with which we must comply in order to maintain authorization to provide, or receive payment for, our services. Compliance with these requirements is complicated by the fact that they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and in some cases are not uniformly applied or interpreted even within the same jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead not only to delays in payment and refund requests, but in extreme cases can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn certain jurisdictions, changes in our ownership structure require pre- or post-notification to state governmental licensing and certification agencies, or agencies with which we have contracts. Relevant laws in some jurisdictions may also require re-application or re-enrollment and approval to maintain or renew our licensure, certification, contracts or other operating authority. Our changes in corporate structure and ownership involving changes in our beneficial ownership required us in some instances to give notice, re-enroll or make other applications for authority to continue operating in various jurisdictions or to begin to receive payment from government payment programs. The extent of such notices and filings may vary in each jurisdiction in which we operate, although those regulatory entities requiring notification generally request factual information regarding the new corporate structure and new ownership composition of the operating entities that hold the applicable licensing and certification.\nWhile we have made consistent efforts to substantially comply with these requirements, we cannot assure you that the agencies that administer these programs or have awarded us contracts will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects. A finding of non-compliance and any resulting payment delays, refund demands or other sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal law does not mandate coverage or reimbursement amounts by private payors for services provided in our facilities.\nPPACA requires all non-grandfathered insurance plans covering emergency services to cover treatment of a \u201cprudent layperson\u201d who reasonably believes his or her health is in jeopardy at emergency departments of a hospital without regard to whether that hospital is in-network. PPACA further prohibits insurance providers from requiring pre-approval authorization or other administrative limits on such services in out-of-network hospitals, and has certain minimum payment provisions for emergency care in a hospital emergency department that meet this prudent layperson standard. Our Arizona hospital should be eligible to receive certain payment protections from these provisions for services provided in the hospital\u2019s emergency room. There is no guaranty that these payment protections will continue to be available to us (or any provider) in the future.\nThese provisions do not currently apply to our freestanding emergency room facilities since these facilities are not hospital emergency departments. Without PPACA\u2019s protections, there is risk that insurance providers may respond to the costs of these new federal mandates by reducing payment to non-covered freestanding emergency departments, such as our operating facilities. Further, many states previously enacted prudent layperson standards that may benefit our facilities. For instance, Texas requires insurers to reimburse services that meet its prudent layperson standard in all out-of-network emergency rooms, including our freestanding emergency room facilities. With the federal changes, states may be less willing to protect non-hospital emergency room services or to maintain their own prudent layperson standard laws. We cannot guarantee that such changes caused by PPACA will not disadvantage our facilities in a way that materially changes our revenue or operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Securities Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, among other things, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced financial disclosure requirements, which include being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following June 24, 2014, the date of our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if our total annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during any three-year period, or if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time. Investors may find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC as a public company, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following June 24, 2014, the date of our initial public offering.\nFurthermore, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdeptus Health Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in Adeptus Health LLC, and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Adeptus Health LLC to pay taxes and pay dividends.\nAdeptus Health Inc. is a holding company that was formed in connection with our initial public offering and has no material assets other than its ownership of the limited liability company units of Adeptus Health LLC (the \u201cLLC Units\u201d). Adeptus Health Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Adeptus Health Inc. intends to cause Adeptus Health LLC to make distributions to its unitholders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates and dividends, if any. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Adeptus Health LLC and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent Adeptus Health Inc. needs funds, and Adeptus Health LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nPayments of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries (including Adeptus Health LLC) to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. First Choice ER, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently subject to certain restrictions and covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, including limits on amounts of leverage, interest charges and capital expenditures. These restrictions and covenants may restrict the ability of those entities to make distributions to Adeptus Health Inc. Any additional financing arrangement we enter into in the future may include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, Adeptus Health LLC is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Adeptus Health LLC (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of Adeptus Health LLC are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to Adeptus Health LLC.\nAdeptus Health Inc. is required to pay the Post-IPO Unit Holders and the Merged Owner certain tax benefits they may claim arising in connection with subsequent exchanges in the future, and the amounts it may pay could be significant.\nIn connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with funds affiliated with our Sponsor, funds affiliated with our founders and certain members of management and our board of directors (the \u201cPost-IPO Unit Holders\u201d) and an affiliate of our Sponsor (the \u201cMerged Owner\u201d) providing for the payment by Adeptus Health Inc. to the Post-IPO Unit Holders of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Adeptus Health Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits.\nWe expect the payments that Adeptus Health Inc. may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise or if distributions to Adeptus Health Inc. by Adeptus Health LLC are not sufficient to permit Adeptus Health Inc. to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon the Post-IPO Unit Holders\u2019 or Merged Owner\u2019s continued ownership of us.\nEstimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the relative value of our assets at the time of the exchange, the price of shares of our common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we realize in the future and the tax rate then applicable, our use of loss carryovers and the portion of our payments under the tax receivable agreement constituting imputed interest or depreciable or amortizable basis.\nWe are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase; however, if the IRS were successful in making such a challenge, we would not be reimbursed for any payments that may previously have been made under the tax receivable agreement if it is later determined that we did not receive the anticipated corresponding tax benefit. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings.\nOur corporate structure may result in conflicts of interest between our stockholders and the holders of LLC Units.\nWe hold our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations through Adeptus Health LLC, which may in the future issue additional LLC Units to third parties. Persons holding LLC Units would have the right to vote on certain amendments to the limited liability company agreement of Adeptus Health LLC, as well as on certain other matters. Persons holding these voting rights may exercise them in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. Circumstances may arise in the future when the interests of members in Adeptus Health LLC conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As we are the managing member of Adeptus Health LLC, we have fiduciary duties to the other members of Adeptus Health LLC that may conflict with fiduciary duties our officers and directors owe to our stockholders. These conflicts may result in decisions that are not in the best interests of stockholders.\nOur Sponsor has significant influence over us in connection with decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our Sponsor held approximately 47.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result of our Sponsor\u2019s ownership, our Sponsor may have, through our board of directors, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. We have in recent years depended on our relationship with our Sponsor to help guide our business plan. In addition, our Sponsor has the right to designate certain of the members of our board of directors, as well as members of our nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee. Our Sponsor also has consent rights with respect to certain significant corporate actions, including the hiring and firing of our chief executive officer, any change in control and any significant acquisitions, divestitures and equity issuances. As a result, our Sponsor potentially has the ability to influence or effectively control our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction (and the terms thereof) and the ability to prevent any change in the composition of our board of directors and certain transactions that require stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction is in our best interests. Conversely, our Sponsor may elect to reduce its ownership in our company or reduce its involvement on our board of directors, which could reduce or eliminate the benefits we have historically achieved through our relationship with it. Additionally, our Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor\u2019s interests may differ from yours.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A common stock;\n\u00b7\nexpressly authorize the board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws by majority vote; and\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also\ndiscourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 14713, "SIC": 8011, "TIC": "ADPTQ"}
