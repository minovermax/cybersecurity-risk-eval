RISK FACTORS.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 potential deterioration of investor confidence resulting from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7 our ability to raise and generate working capital to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 failure of our products to operate as advertised;\n\u00b7 success of competitive products;\n\u00b7 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u00b7 litigation involving our Company, our general industry or both;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 general perception of us.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Utah law could discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Utah corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Utah Control Shares Acquisition Act may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by limiting the voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition. In addition, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable. Among other things, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and bylaws:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors in response to a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, except a vacancy occurring by reason of the removal of a director without cause shall be filled by vote of the shareholders; and\n\u00b7 limit who may call special meetings of shareholders.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our shareholders.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board, or OTCBB. However, there is no guarantee that our common stock will be actively traded on the OTCBB, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common stock is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, some aspects of the OTCBB may deter investors from purchasing our common stock, which can suppress trading in our common stock. For example, the OTCBB lacks the strict listing standards of a national stock exchange regarding corporate governance, a minimum stock price, and various matters which have to be approved by shareholders. The only requirement for inclusion in the OTCBB is that the issuer be current in its SEC reporting requirements, and that the issuer obligates itself to file periodic reports and otherwise comply with those provisions of the 1934 Act applicable to it. Shareholders of OTCBB companies frequently have difficulty in getting buy/sell orders filled promptly, and/or at expected prices. OTCBB companies generally have lower trading volume, which contributes to the illiquidity of investing in such companies. Trading activity on the OTCBB is not conducted as efficiently as trades of national stock exchange-listed securities. There are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the OTCBB, so trades must be conducted by telephone by a broker-dealer. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may increase the time it takes to make trades and the price of the stock may fluctuate in the interim. These factors may make it difficult for investors to buy additional shares or to sell the shares that they hold.\nOur common stock is subject to \u201cPenny Stock\u201d restrictions.\nAs long as the price of our common stock remains at less than $5 per share, we will be subject to so-called \u201cpenny stock rules\u201d which could decrease our stock\u2019s market liquidity. The SEC has adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include any equity security that has a market price of less than $5 per share or an exercise price of less than $5 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery to and execution by the retail customer of a written declaration of suitability relating to the penny stock, which must include disclosure of the commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, the broker/dealer must send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Those requirements could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will rise above $5 per share so as to avoid these regulations.\nFurther issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current stockholders.\nIt is possible that we will be required to seek additional capital in the future. This capital funding could involve one or more types of equity securities, including convertible debt, common or convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock. Such equity securities could be issued at or below the then-prevailing market price for our common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock will be dilutive to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe exercise of conversion rights, options and warrants outstanding and available for issuance may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding employee options to purchase a total of 1,930,225 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.14 to $5.60 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.40. As of December 31, 2014, we had warrants outstanding to purchase a total of 7,915,533 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.13 to $3.00 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.27. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale in the public market of the shares purchased upon such exercise will be dilutive to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe industry within which we operate is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve broad market acceptance in the markets within which we compete. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products.\nDelays in product development and introduction could result in:\n\u00b7 loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share; and\n\u00b7 negative publicity and damage to our reputation and the reputation of our product offerings; and\n\u00b7 decline in the average selling price of our products.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2014 that, if not properly remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nBased on an evaluation of our disclosure of internal controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014, our management has concluded that, as of such date, there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the need for a stronger internal control environment. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected. Until these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are remediated, there is reasonable possibility that material misstatements of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected by our internal controls in a timely manner.\nGovernment regulation of our products could impair our ability to sell such products in certain markets.\nThe rules of the FCC permit the operation of unlicensed digital devices that radiate radio frequency emissions if the manufacturer complies with certain equipment authorization procedures, technical requirements, marketing restrictions and product labeling requirements. Differing technical requirements apply to \u201cClass A\u201d devices intended for use in commercial settings, and \u201cClass B\u201d devices intended for residential use to which more stringent standards apply. An independent, FCC-certified testing lab has verified that our iWire System product suite complies with the FCC technical requirements for Class A and Class B digital devices. No further testing of these devices is required, and the devices may be manufactured and marketed for commercial and residential use. Additional devices designed by us for commercial and residential use will be subject to the FCC rules for unlicensed digital devices. Moreover, if in the future, the FCC changes its technical requirements for unlicensed digital devices, further testing and/or modifications of devices may be necessary. Failure to comply with any FCC technical requirements could impair our ability to sell our products in certain markets and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nProducts sold by our competitors could become more popular than our products or render our products obsolete.\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. These competitors may, among other things, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on the sales channel than we can. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with these competitors, and these competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more widely accepted than those being developed by us or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. We anticipate that competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. These competitors may have more advanced technology, more extensive distribution channels, stronger brand names, bigger promotional budgets and larger customer bases than we do. These companies could devote more capital resources to develop, manufacture and market competing products than we could. If any of these companies are successful in competing against us, our sales could decline, our margins could be negatively impacted, and we could lose market share, any of which could seriously harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nInfringement by third parties on our proprietary technology and development of substantially equivalent proprietary technology by our competitors could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends partly on our ability to maintain patent and trade secret protection, to obtain future patents and licenses and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, including intellectual property rights of third parties integrated into our Telkonet iWire System product suite and our EcoSmart Suite of products will prevent misappropriation or circumvention. A patent associated with our Recovery Time technology expired in February 2014. To the extent any competitors are successful in creating competing technologies, this could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. In addition, there can be no assurance that any patent application, when filed, will result in an issued patent, or that our existing patents, or any patents that may be issued in the future, will provide us with significant protection against competitors. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be infringed upon or circumvented by others. Infringement by third parties on our proprietary technology could negatively impact our business. Moreover, litigation to establish the validity of patents, to assert infringement claims against others, and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome is in our favor. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, techniques or processes or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology. If our competitors develop substantially equivalent technology and we are unable to enforce any intellectual property rights with respect to such technology in a cost-effective manner or at all, our business and operations would suffer significant harm.\nWe may incur substantial damages due to litigation.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If it were determined that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of another, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from licensing or using the infringing products or technology. Additionally, if it were determined that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, or to re-engineer our products successfully. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.\nWe depend on a small team of senior management and may have difficulty attracting and retaining additional personnel.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the continued services and performance of senior management and other key personnel. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our overall operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our future success will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, purchasing and customer service personnel when they are needed. Competition for these individuals is intense. We cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel when the need arises. Any failure to attract and retain the necessary technical, managerial, marketing, purchasing and customer service personnel could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions we make could result in difficulties in successfully managing our business and consequently harm our financial condition.\nWe may seek to expand by acquiring complementary businesses in our current or ancillary markets. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments that might be required. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may lead to higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses, if any, without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. In addition, acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including:\n\u00b7 failure of the acquired businesses to achieve expected results;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources to acquisitions;\n\u00b7 failure to retain key customers or personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 disappointing quality or functionality of acquired equipment and people; and\n\u00b7 risks associated with unanticipated events, liabilities or contingencies.\nClient dissatisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired business could negatively affect our reputation. The inability to acquire businesses on reasonable terms or successfully integrate and manage acquired companies, or the occurrence of performance problems at acquired companies, could result in dilution, unfavorable accounting treatment or one-time charges and difficulties in successfully managing our business.\nOur inability to obtain capital, use internally generated cash or debt, or use shares of our common stock to finance our operations or future acquisitions could impair the growth and expansion of our business.\nReliance on internally generated cash or debt to finance our operations or complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility. The extent to which we will be able or willing to use shares of our common stock to consummate acquisitions will depend on the market value of our common stock which will vary, and our liquidity. Using shares of our common stock for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our then existing stockholders. To the extent that we are unable to use our common stock to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital through debt or additional equity financings. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the necessary capital to finance any acquisitions or our other cash needs. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we may be required to reduce the scope of any expansion or redirect resources committed to internal purposes. In addition to requiring funding for acquisitions, we may need additional funds to implement our internal growth and operating strategies or to finance other aspects of our operations. Our failure to: (i) obtain additional capital on acceptable terms; (ii) use internally generated cash or debt to complete acquisitions because it significantly limits our operational or financial flexibility; or (iii) use shares of our common stock to make future acquisitions, may hinder our ability to actively pursue any acquisitions.\nPotential fluctuations in operating results could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, most of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 the level of use of the Internet;\n\u00b7 the demand for high-tech goods;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations;\n\u00b7 price competition or pricing changes in the industry;\n\u00b7 technical difficulties or system downtime;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental policies;\n\u00b7 economic conditions specific to the internet and communications industry; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nOur financial results may also be significantly impacted by certain accounting treatment of acquisitions, financing transactions or other matters. Such accounting treatment could have a material impact on our results of operations and have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers. If these companies fail to perform or experience delays, shortages, or increased demand for their products or services, we may face shortages, increased costs, and may be required to suspend deployment of our products and services.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide the components and the equipment required to deliver our solutions. If these providers fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or we are unable to renew these agreements, we may be forced to suspend the sale and deployment of our products and services and enrollment of new customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur management and operational systems might be inadequate to handle our potential growth.\nWe may experience growth that could place a significant strain upon our management and operational systems and resources. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational systems, organization and financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may fail to make these improvements effectively. Additionally, our efforts to make these improvements may divert the focus of our personnel. We must integrate our key executives into a cohesive management team to expand our business. If new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the growth we will need to increase our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. We may not be able to effectively manage such growth, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be affected if the United States participates in wars or military or other action or by international terrorism.\nInvolvement in a war or other military action or acts of terrorism may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the extent that such disruptions result in (i) delays or cancellations of customer orders, (ii) a general decrease in consumer spending on information technology, (iii) our inability to effectively market and distribute our services or products or (iv) our inability to access capital markets, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are unable to predict whether the involvement in a war or other military action will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such involvement or responses will have any long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur exposure to the credit risk of our customers and suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe sell our products to customers that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulties. If our customers experience financial difficulties, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers. While we perform credit evaluations and adjust credit limits based upon each customer\u2019s payment history and credit worthiness, such programs may not be effective in reducing our exposure to credit risk. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable, and based on this evaluation make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts for expected losses. Actual bad debt write-offs may differ from our estimates, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur suppliers may also experience financial difficulties, which could result in our having difficulty sourcing the materials and components we use in producing our products and providing our services. If we encounter such difficulties, we may not be able to produce our products for our customers in a timely fashion which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in the economy and credit markets may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nOur operations and performance depend to some degree on general economic conditions and their impact on our customers\u2019 finances and purchase decisions. As a result of economic events, potential customers may elect to defer purchases of capital equipment items, such as the products we manufacture and supply. Additionally, the credit markets and the financial services industry are subject to change. While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have a material adverse effect on our customers\u2019 ability to fund their operations thus adversely impacting their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, the collection of payments for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain payment and performance bonds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to deploy our EcoSmart Suite of products into the energy management initiatives in federal funded or assisted projects may rely on our ability to obtain payment and performance bonds which may be an essential element to work orders for the installation of our products and services. If we are unable to obtain payment and performance bonds in a timely fashion as required by an applicable work order, we may not be entitled to payment under the work order until such bonds have been provided or until such a requirement is expressly waived. In addition, any delays due to a failure to furnish bonds may not entitle us to a price increase for the work or an extension of time to complete the work and may entitle the other party to terminate our work order without liability and to indemnify such party from damages suffered as a result of our failure to deliver the bonds and the termination of the work order. As a result, the failure to obtain bonds where required could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nIn its report dated March 31, 2015, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern based on our history of operating cash flow deficits, liquidity constraints and negative working capital. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit, positive operating cash flows and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including by the sale of our securities or assets, or to obtain loans from financial institutions, where possible. Our history of net operating losses and the uncertainty regarding contingent liabilities cast doubt on our ability to meet such goals.\nWe have a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 190,000,000 shares of common stock under our Articles of Incorporation. As of March 22, 2015, we have issued 125,035,612 shares of common stock and have approximately 14,509,303 shares of common stock committed for issuance giving effect to the assumed exercise of all outstanding warrants and options and assumed conversion of preferred stock. Due to the limited number of authorized shares available for issuance and because of the significant competition for acquisitions, we may not able to consummate an acquisition until we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue. To facilitate the possibility and flexibility of raising additional capital or the completion of potential acquisitions, we would need to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock. We can provide no assurance that we will succeed in amending our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue.\nWe have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit and may incur losses in the foreseeable future.\nSince inception through December 31, 2014, we have incurred cumulative losses of $121,906,017 and have never generated enough funds through operations to support our business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had an operating cash flow deficit of $4,601. As of December 31, 2014, we have a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $420,106. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our technology, the industry in which we operate, and other factors, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or if we will remain profitable. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from our operations to meet our working capital requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or debt financings. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur business activities might require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and our ability to operate going forward.\nThe actual amount of capital required to fund our operations and development may vary materially from our estimates. If our operations fail to generate the cash that we expect, we may have to seek additional capital to fund our business. If we are required to obtain additional funding in the future, we may have to sell assets, seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital. In addition, any indebtedness we incur in the future could subject us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business. If we do not comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings.\nIf we raise funds by selling more stock, your ownership in us will be diluted, and we may grant future investors rights superior to those of the common stock that you hold. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed, we may have to delay, modify or abandon some of our expansion plans. This could slow our growth, negatively affect our ability to compete in our industry and adversely affect our financial condition.\nA significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nIn connection with the preparation of the 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the management of the Company assessed and determined that the estimated carrying value of the Company\u2019s Smart Systems International reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a material impairment charge of $2.8 million to goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impairment charge resulted in eliminating the remaining balance of Smart Systems International reporting unit asset. We have goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $5.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014, resulting from past acquisitions. We evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit to which this goodwill relates at least once a year during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate a potential impairment. This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of the reporting unit decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the reporting unit. These changes could result in an additional impairment of the existing goodwill balance in the future that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations or other penalties.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date or could result in other penalties. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. On May 31, 2013, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Bridge Bank, NA (the \u201cBank\u201d). As of September 30, 2013 and up to May 31, 2014, we were in violation of a financial performance covenant under the Agreement. The Bank had chosen not to exercise any default provisions. On May 31, 2014, the Company and the Bank mutually agreed to terminate the Agreement and the Company paid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $50,000.\nOn September 30, 2014, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, EthoStream LLC, as co-borrowers (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California state chartered bank (\u201cHeritage Bank\u201d), governing a new revolving credit facility in a principal amount not to exceed $2,000,000 (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information regarding the Loan Agreement.\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board, which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, such as us, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.", "PERMNO": 90054, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "TKOI"}
