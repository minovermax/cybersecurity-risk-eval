{"cik": "94049", "company": "STEPAN CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, may cause future results of operations to differ materially from past results or those results currently expected or desired. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nDisruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities, both planned and unplanned, may have a material impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nManufacturing facilities in the Company\u2019s industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds and outages. Unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant amount of time to increase production or qualify with Company customers, each of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Long-term production disruptions may cause Company customers to seek alternative supply, which could further adversely affect Company profitability.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products cannot currently be made, or made in the volume required, at more than one of the Company\u2019s locations. For some of these products, the Company has access to external market suppliers, but the Company cannot guarantee that these products will be available to it in amounts sufficient to meet its requirements or at a cost that is competitive with the Company\u2019s cost of manufacturing these products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage, some of these manufacturing issues may not be insurable, and when they are insurable, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover any or all losses resulting from the occurrence of any of these events or that insurance carriers would not deny coverage for these losses even if they are insured. There is also a risk, beyond the reasonable control of the Company, that an insurance carrier may not have the financial resources to cover an insurable loss. As a result, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company faces significant global competition in each of its operating segments. If the Company cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, its profitability, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company faces significant competition from numerous global companies as well as national, regional and local companies in the markets it serves. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s customers have internal manufacturing capabilities that allow them to achieve make-versus-buy economics, which may result at times in the Company gaining or losing business with these customers in volumes that could adversely affect its profitability.\nTo achieve expected profitability levels, the Company must, among other things, maintain the service levels, product quality and performance and competitive pricing necessary to retain existing customers and attract new customers. The Company\u2019s inability to do so could place it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors, and if the Company cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe volatility of raw material, natural gas and electricity costs as well as any disruption in their supply may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe costs of raw materials, natural gas and electricity represent a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs. The principal raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products are petroleum-based or plant-based. Natural gas is used in the Company\u2019s manufacturing sites primarily to generate steam for its manufacturing processes. The prices of many of these raw materials have recently been very volatile. These fluctuations in prices may be affected by supply and demand factors, such as general economic conditions, manufacturers\u2019 ability to meet demand, restrictions on the transport of raw material (some of which may be viewed as hazardous), currency exchange rates, political instability and terrorist attacks, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may not be able to pass increased raw material and energy costs on to customers through increases in product prices as a result of arrangements the Company has with certain customers and competitive pressures in the market. If the Company is unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material and energy costs or pass such increased costs on to customers, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company relies heavily on third party transportation to deliver raw materials to Company manufacturing facilities and ship products to Company customers. Disruptions in transportation or significant changes in transportation costs could affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company relies heavily on railroads, barges and other over-the-road shipping methods to transport raw materials to its manufacturing facilities and to ship finished product to customers. Transport operations are exposed to various risks, such as extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards, as well as interstate transportation regulations. If the Company is unable to ship finished product or unable to obtain raw materials due to transportation problems, or if there are significant changes in the cost of these services, the Company may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship product, which could result in an adverse effect on Company revenues, costs and operating results.\nCustomer product reformulations or new technologies can reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company\u2019s products are used in a broad range of customer product applications. Customer product reformulations or development and use of new technologies may lead to reduced consumption of Company-produced products or make some Company products unnecessary. It is imperative that the Company develops new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. The Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the Company is unable to manage successfully the maturation of existing products and the introduction of new products.\nIf the Company is unable to keep and protect its intellectual property rights, the Company\u2019s ability to compete may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company relies on intellectual property rights for the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products in all three of its reportable segments. Although most of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights are registered in the United States and in the foreign countries in which it operates, the Company may not be able to assert these rights successfully in the future or guarantee that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Other parties may infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, which may dilute the value of such rights. Infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could also result in diversion of management\u2019s time and the Company\u2019s resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any loss of protection of these intellectual property rights could adversely affect the future financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its operations outside the U.S.\nThe Company has substantial operations outside the U.S. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s sales outside of the U.S. constituted approximately 40 percent of the Company\u2019s net sales. In addition to the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are common to both the Company\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S. operations, the Company faces, and will continue to face, risks related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations such as:\n\u00b7\nvariability of intellectual property laws outside the U.S. may impact enforceability and consistency of protection of intellectual property assets;\n\u00b7\nhigh levels of inflation;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. Dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic, financial and market conditions may be unstable;\n\u00b7\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\ntrade and currency restrictions, including currency exchange controls imposed by foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed, impose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nenforceability and compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the U.S.\nThe actual occurrence of any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect Company financial results.\nThe Company is also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company\u2019s results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. However, outside the U.S., the Company\u2019s sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Philippine peso, Brazilian real, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar and Chinese RMB. Fluctuations in exchange rates may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn all jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the Company is also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into U.S. dollars. A weakening of the currencies in which the Company generates sales relative to the foreign currencies in which the Company\u2019s costs are denominated may lower the Company\u2019s operating profits and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and product registration laws that expose it to potential financial liability and increased operating costs.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air, soil and water as well as the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as well as analogous state, local and foreign laws, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances Act (REACH). Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations is a major consideration for the Company because the Company uses hazardous materials in some of the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes. In addition, compliance with environmental laws could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to expand its facilities or require the Company to acquire additional costly pollution control equipment, incur other significant expenses or modify its manufacturing processes. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating costs in complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, because the Company generates hazardous wastes during some of its manufacturing processes, the Company, along with any other entity that disposes or arranges for the disposal of the Company\u2019s wastes, may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with any investigation and remediation of sites at which the Company has disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if those sites become contaminated, even if the Company fully complied with applicable environmental laws at the time of disposal. In the event that new contamination is discovered, the Company may become subject to additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the Company\u2019s clean-up obligations.\nThe transportation of certain raw materials is highly regulated and is subject to increased regulation or restrictions, which may restrict or prohibit transport of these raw materials, resulting in these raw materials not being available to the Company and restricting or substantially limiting the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations.\nThe Company is also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws that regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution and labeling of many of the Company\u2019s products, including some of the Company\u2019s disinfecting, sanitizing and antimicrobial products. Some of these laws require the Company to have operating permits for the Company\u2019s production facilities, warehouse facilities and operations. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also require the Company to register the Company\u2019s products and to comply with specified requirements with respect to those products. If the Company fails to comply with any of these laws and regulations, it may be liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions in excess of the Company\u2019s recorded liabilities, and may also be subject to fines, injunctions or criminal sanctions or to revocation, non-renewal or modification of the Company\u2019s operating permits and revocation of the Company\u2019s product registrations. Any such revocation, modification or non-renewal may require the Company to cease or limit the manufacture and sale of its products at one or more of the Company\u2019s facilities, which may limit or prevent the Company\u2019s ability to meet product demand or build new facilities and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such revocation, non-renewal or modification may also result in an event of default under the indenture for the Company\u2019s notes or under the Company\u2019s credit facilities, which, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of all the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nIn addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, the Company has incurred and may incur in the future costs defending against environmental litigation and/or investigations brought by government agencies and private parties. The Company may be a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage, personal injury\nor property damage. A significant judgment or settlement, to the extent not covered by existing insurance policies, against the Company could harm its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company has insurance that may cover some of these potential losses, there is always uncertainty as to whether such insurance may be available to the Company based on case-specific factors and the specific provisions of the Company\u2019s insurance policies.\nThe potential cost to the Company relating to environmental, health and safety and product registration matters, including the cost of complying with the foregoing legislation and remediating contamination, is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and product registration, including those outside of the U.S., and the timing, variable costs and effectiveness of clean-up and compliance methods. Environmental and product registration laws may also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, as well as restricting or prohibiting the sale of existing or new products, which may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results. Without limiting the foregoing, these laws or regulations may restrict or prohibit the use of non-renewable or carbon-based substances, or impose fees or penalties for the use of these substances. Accordingly, the Company may become subject to additional liabilities and increased operating costs in the future under these laws and regulations. The impact of any such changes, which are unknown at this time, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of recorded liabilities for existing and future contingencies may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe liabilities recorded by the Company for pending and threatened legal proceedings are estimates based on various assumptions. An adverse ruling or external forces, such as changes in the rate of inflation, the regulatory environment and other factors that could prove such assumptions to be no longer appropriate, may affect the accuracy of these estimates. Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates, the Company\u2019s actual liabilities could differ significantly from the estimated amounts the Company records in its financial statements with respect to existing and future contingencies. If the Company\u2019s actual liability is higher than estimated or any new legal proceeding is initiated, it could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, or need to refinance existing indebtedness, in the future, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $332.6 million of debt on its balance sheet. U.S. debt included $322.1 million in unsecured promissory notes with maturities extending from 2016 until 2027.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries also maintain bank term loans and short-term bank lines of credit in their respective countries to meet working capital requirements as well as to fund capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries\u2019 aggregate outstanding debt totaled $10.5 million.\nThe Company\u2019s current indebtedness and any additional indebtedness incurred in the future may materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nrequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on the Company\u2019s debt, which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds that may be needed to operate and expand its business;\n\u00b7\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industries in which the Company operates;\n\u00b7\nincrease the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in the Company\u2019s business; and\n\u00b7\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.\nThe Company\u2019s loan agreements contain provisions, which, among others, require maintenance of certain financial ratios and place limitations on additional debt, investments and payment of dividends. Failure to comply with these loan agreements would require debt restructuring that could be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, any future disruptions in the credit and financial markets may reduce the availability of debt financing or refinancing and\nincrease the costs associated with such financing. If the Company is unable to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, its business financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nDownturns in certain industries and general economic downturns may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic downturns may adversely affect users of some end products that are manufactured using the Company\u2019s products and the industries in which such end products are used. These users may reduce their volume of purchases of such end products during economic downturns, which would reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, uncertain conditions in the credit markets pose a risk to the overall economy that may impact consumer and customer demand of some of the Company\u2019s products, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. Some of the Company\u2019s customers may not be able to meet the terms of sale and suppliers may not be able to fully perform their contractual obligations due to tighter credit markets or a general slowdown in economic activity.\nIn the event that economic conditions worsen or result in a prolonged downturn or recession, the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nCost overruns, delays and miscalculations in capacity needs with respect to the Company\u2019s expansion or other capital projects could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the Company initiates expansion and other significant capital projects. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following: shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment; unanticipated cost increases; difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions; difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals; availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations; design and engineering problems; and failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes. Significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s return on investment, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the Company miscalculates its anticipated capacity needs, this too could negatively impact its operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct its business. Interruption of, damage to or compromise of the Company\u2019s IT systems could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies on IT systems for most areas of operations, including production, supply chain, research and development, finance, human resource and regulatory functions. The Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of these systems. IT system failures due to events including but not limited to network disruptions, programming errors, computer viruses and security breaches (e.g., cyber-attacks) could impact production activities, impede shipment of products, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, or hamper the processing of transactions or reporting of financial results. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. The Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information privacy and security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. While the Company has a comprehensive program for continuously reviewing, maintaining, testing and upgrading its IT systems and security, there can be no assurance that such efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in Company systems that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious liability claims could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. The Company faces an inherent exposure to various types of claims including general liability, product liability, product recall, toxic tort and environmental (\u201cclaims\u201d), among others, if its products, or the end products that are manufactured with the Company\u2019s products, result in property damage, injury or death. In addition, because the Company conducts business in multiple jurisdictions, the Company also faces an inherent exposure to other general claims based on its operations in those jurisdictions and the laws of those jurisdictions, including but not limited to claims arising from its relationship with employees, distributors, agents and customers, and other parties with whom it has a business relationship, directly or indirectly. Many of these claims may be made against the Company even if there is no evidence of a loss from that claim, and these claims may be either made by individual entities, or potentially a group of plaintiffs in a class action. Defending these claims could result in significant legal expenses relating to defense costs and/or damage awards and diversion of management\u2019s time and the Company\u2019s resources. Any claim brought against the Company, net of potential insurance recoveries, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s forecasts and other forward-looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions and estimates that are subject to significant uncertainties. The Company\u2019s performance may not be consistent with these forecasts or forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time in press releases and other documents filed with the SEC, the Company publishes forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding its future results, including estimated revenues, net earnings and other operating and financial metrics.\nAny forecast or forward-looking statement related to the Company\u2019s future performance reflects various assumptions and estimates, which are subject to significant uncertainties, and the achievement of any forecast or forward-looking statement depends on numerous risks and other factors, including those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If these assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect, or any of the risks or other factors occur, then the Company\u2019s performance may not be consistent with these forecasts or forward-looking statements.\nYou are cautioned not to rely solely on such forward-looking statements, but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information affecting the Company, the Company\u2019s services and the Company\u2019s industry, when evaluating the Company\u2019s forecasts and other forward-looking statements relating to the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance.", "PERMNO": 36898, "SIC": 2840, "TIC": "SCL"}
