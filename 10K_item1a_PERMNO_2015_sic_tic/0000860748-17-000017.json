Risk Factors.\nKemper is exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The following discussion details the significant risk factors that are specific to the Company. In addition to those described below, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by other factors not presently known by, or considered material to, the Company. Readers are advised to consider all of these factors along with the other information included in this 2016 Annual Report, including the factors set forth under the caption \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 1, and to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate under an extensive insurance regulatory system. Current laws and regulations encompass a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, market conduct, trade practices, claims practices, reserve and loss ratio requirements, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, restrictions on the payment of dividends, approvals of transactions involving a change in control of one or more insurance companies, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy. They also require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports and holding company reports. Pre-approval requirements often restrict the companies from implementing premium rate changes for property, casualty and health insurance policies, introducing new, or making changes to existing, policy forms and many other actions. Insurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries and can suspend or delay their operations or licenses, require corrective actions, and impose penalties or other remedies available for compliance failures. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries and related emerging developments, see \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese laws and regulations, and their interpretation by the various regulators and courts, are undergoing continual revision and expansion. The legal and regulatory landscape within which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, issues may emerge, whether intended or not. These emerging practices, conditions and issues could adversely affect Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways, including, for example, by expansion of coverages beyond the underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims, accelerating the payment of claims or adding to operational costs. Industry practices that were once considered approved, compliant and reasonable may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of a court or regulatory ruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. It is not possible for the Company to predict such shifts in legal or regulatory enforcement or to accurately estimate the impact they may have on the Company and its operations.\nOne area where the legal and regulatory landscape is experiencing significant change is in connection with the mandated use of death verification databases (a \u201cDMF\u201d) by life insurance companies in their policy administration and claims handling practices. In recent years, many states have adopted new laws requiring insurers to proactively use such databases, including the Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File, to varying degrees in order to ascertain if an insured may be deceased. More than twenty states have adopted such laws, and Kemper cannot predict whether additional states will enact similar legislation or, if enacted, what form such legislation may take. These laws require the insurer to initiate the claims process even though the insureds\u2019 beneficiaries have not submitted a claim, including proof of death, as required by regulator-approved policy forms and the insurer was otherwise unaware of the insured\u2019s death. In a related development, many states have expanded the application of their unclaimed property laws, particularly as they relate to life insurance proceeds, and the treasurers or controllers of a large number of states have engaged audit firms to examine the practices of life insurance companies with respect to the reporting and remittance of such proceeds under unclaimed property laws. The push to alter historic practices that were previously considered lawful and appropriate relative to both claims handling and remittance of life insurance policy proceeds under unclaimed property laws has caused the Company to be involved in compliance audits, market conduct examinations and litigation. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process to compare life insurance records against a DMF and other databases to determine if any of its insured may be deceased. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,\u201d and Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nThe financial services industry, including insurance companies and their holding company systems, remains under regulatory scrutiny. While it is not possible to predict how new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may impact the operations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, several developments have the potential to significantly impact such operations. This includes increased regulatory focus on cybersecurity and state adoption of extensive modifications to state holding company laws that substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators beyond licensed insurance companies to their non-insurance affiliates and their organizations as a whole, particularly with respect to\nenterprise risk. In addition, the Health Care Acts have resulted in regulations affecting health insurers such as Reserve National, and potential changes to the state insurance regulatory system may result from the Dodd-Frank Act. See the discussion of these matters under \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese new developments and significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to conduct and grow their businesses.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable and could produce one or more unexpected verdicts against the Company that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nKemper and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of their businesses. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to Kemper or one or more of its subsidiaries, while others may pertain to business practices in the industry in which Kemper and its subsidiaries operate. Some lawsuits may seek class action status that, if granted, could expose the Company to potentially significant liability by virtue of the size of the putative classes. These matters often raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. A further complication is that even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is deemed to be remote using traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which the Company operates, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nFor information about the Company\u2019s pending legal proceedings, see Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and wildfires and may include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and hazardous material spills. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may be impacted by the uncertain effects of climate change. The extent of the Company\u2019s losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the geographic area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The Company could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.\nKemper\u2019s life and health insurance subsidiaries are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as pandemic or other events that result in large numbers of deaths. In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on the Company\u2019s workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate.\nThe property and casualty insurance subsidiaries use catastrophe modeling tools developed by third parties to project their potential exposure to property damage resulting from catastrophic events under various scenarios. Such models are based on various assumptions and judgments which may turn out to be wrong. The actual impact of one or more catastrophic events could adversely and materially differ from these projections.\nChanges in the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance and in the ability of reinsurers to meet their obligations could result in Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries retaining more risk and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance does not relieve such subsidiaries of their direct liability to their policyholders. As long as the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for such subsidiaries is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. While such subsidiaries\u2019 principal reinsurers are each rated \u201cA-\u201d or better by A.M. Best at the time reinsurance is purchased, the Company cannot be certain that reinsurers will pay the amounts due from them either now, in the future, or on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control determine the availability of the reinsurance protection that Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may purchase. A decrease in the amount of reinsurance protection that such subsidiaries purchase generally should increase their risk of a more severe loss. However, if the amount of available reinsurance is reduced, such subsidiaries may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect the ability of such subsidiaries to write future insurance policies or result in their retaining more risk with respect to such policies.\nThe extent to which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries can manage their catastrophe exposure through underwriting strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also manage their exposure to catastrophe losses through underwriting strategies such as reducing exposures in, or withdrawing from, catastrophe-prone areas, establishing appropriate guidelines for insurable structures, and setting appropriate rates, deductibles, exclusions and policy limits. The extent to which such subsidiaries can manage their exposure through such strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action. For example, laws and regulations may limit the rate or timing at which insurers may non-renew insurance policies in catastrophe-prone areas or require insurers to participate in wind pools and joint underwriting associations. Generally, an insurer\u2019s participation in such pools and associations are based on the insurer\u2019s market share determined on a state-wide basis. Accordingly, even though Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may not incur a direct insured loss as a result of managing direct catastrophe exposures, they may incur indirect losses from required participation in pools and associations. Laws and regulations requiring prior approval of policy forms and premium rates may limit the ability of Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to increase rates or deductibles on a timely basis, which may result in additional losses or lower returns than otherwise would have occurred in an unregulated market. See the risk factor above under the title \u201cKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\u201d\nA downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThird-party rating agencies assess the financial strength and rate the claims-paying ability of insurance companies based on criteria established by the rating agencies. Third-party ratings are important competitive factors in the insurance industry. Financial strength ratings are used to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings agencies may downgrade the ratings of Kemper and/or its insurance subsidiaries or require Kemper to retain more capital in its insurance businesses to maintain existing ratings following developments that they deem negative. This can include factors directly related to the Company, such as an increase in the catastrophic risk retained by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, or developments in industry or general economic conditions. A downgrade by A.M. Best in the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, particularly those operating in the preferred and standard market or offering homeowners insurance, could result in a substantial loss of business if independent agents and brokers or policyholders of such subsidiaries move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. Any substantial loss of business could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of such subsidiaries. A downgrade in Kemper\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) may reduce Kemper\u2019s ability to access the capital markets or may increase the cost to refinance existing debt.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive, making it difficult to grow profitability and within expectations of investors.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance businesses face significant competition, and their ability to compete is affected by a variety of issues relative to others in the industry, such as quality of management, product pricing, service quality, financial strength and name recognition. Competitive success is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nCompetitiveness of prices charged for insurance policies;\n\u2022\nSophistication of pricing segmentation;\n\u2022\nDesign and introduction of insurance products to meet emerging consumer trends;\n\u2022\nSelection and retention of agents and other business partners;\n\u2022\nCompensation paid to agents;\n\u2022\nUnderwriting discipline;\n\u2022\nSelectiveness of sales markets;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of marketing materials and name recognition;\n\u2022\nProduct and technological innovation;\n\u2022\nAbility to settle claims timely and efficiently;\n\u2022\nAbility to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of deployment and use of information technology across all aspects of operations;\n\u2022\nAbility to control operating expenses;\n\u2022\nFinancial strength ratings; and\n\u2022\nQuality of services provided to, and ease of doing business with, independent agents and brokers or policyholders.\nThe inability to compete effectively in any of the Company\u2019s insurance businesses could materially reduce the Company\u2019s customer base and revenues and could materially and adversely affect the future results and financial condition of the Company.\nSee \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 8 and page 10, for more information on the competitive rankings in the property and casualty insurance markets and the life and health insurance markets, respectively, in the United States.\nTechnology initiatives, particularly large, multi-year initiatives, to address business developments and regulatory requirements present significant economic and competitive challenges to the Company. Failure to complete and implement such initiatives in a timely manner could result in incurring internal use software development costs that may not be recoverable and the inability to meet emerging consumer and competitive needs which may result in the loss of business.\nData and analytics play an increasingly important role in the insurance industry. While technology developments can facilitate the use of data and analytics, streamline business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present significant economic and organizational challenges to the Company and potential short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses and implementation schedules could change materially and costs could escalate over time, while the ultimate utility of a technology initiative could deteriorate over time. For example, in 2015 and 2014, the Company wrote off costs that had been capitalized in connection with multi-year computer software development projects related to systems that had been intended to replace certain aging systems of the Company\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance segment. Accordingly, the Company is in the process of undertaking new multi-year projects to replace these aging systems, as well as certain aging systems in its Life & Health Insurance segment.\nIn addition, due to the highly-regulated nature of the financial services industry, the Company faces rising costs and competing time constraints in adapting technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. The costs to develop and implement systems to replace the Company\u2019s aging systems and to comply with new regulatory requirements as needed over time are expected to be material. Due to the complexities involved and the results of the Company\u2019s past attempts to replace its aging systems, there can be no assurances that new multi-year projects will be successful and that the costs incurred to develop and implement the replacement systems will be recoverable. Furthermore, failure to implement replacement systems in a timely manner could result in loss of business from the Company\u2019s inability to design and introduce new insurance products to meet emerging consumer and competitive trends.\nFailure to maintain the security of personal data may result in lost business, reputational harm, legal costs and regulatory penalties.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries obtain and store vast amounts of personal data that can present significant risks to the Company and its customers and employees. An increasing array of laws and regulations govern the use and storage of such data, including, for example, social security numbers, credit card data and protected health information. Despite the implementation of various security measures, the Company\u2019s data systems, or those of its third party administrators and other business partners working on behalf of the Company, may be vulnerable to security breaches due to the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, viruses, malware, hackers and other external hazards, as well as equipment and system failures and inadvertent errors, negligence or intentional misconduct of employees and/or contractors. The Company also relies on the ability of its business partners to maintain secure systems and processes that comply with legal requirements and protect personal data. These increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements related to personal data privacy and security expose the Company to potential data loss and resulting damages, regulatory fines and other liabilities, reputational risk and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs. Although Kemper maintains cyber risk insurance, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to cover all of the costs of one or more data breach incidents that could occur.\nIn the event of non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an information security framework for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM and point-of-sale cards, such organizations could prevent Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries from collecting premium payments from customers by way of such cards and impose significant fines on Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries.\nFailure to maintain the availability of critical systems may result in lost business, reputational harm, legal costs and regulatory penalties.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations rely on the continuous availability of its computer systems, including computer systems used by third party administrators working on behalf of the Company. In addition to disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or other data breaches, such systems may be adversely affected by natural and man-made catastrophes. The failure of the Company, or its third party administrators or other business partners, to maintain business continuity in the wake of such events may prevent the timely completion of critical processes across its operations, including, for example, insurance policy administration, claims processing, billing, treasury and investment operations and payroll. These failures could result in significant loss of business, fines and litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses.\nThe Company maintains a diversified investment portfolio that is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, including interest rate (risk-free and spread), equity price, and liquidity, as well as risks from changes in tax laws and regulations and other risks from changes in general economic conditions.\nThe interest rate environment has a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and position. In recent years, rates have been at or near historic lows. A protracted low interest rate environment would continue to place pressure on net investment income, particularly related to fixed income securities, short-term investments and limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting (\u201cEquity Method Limited Liability Investments\u201d) that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt of other companies. A decline in interest rates would generally increase the carrying value of the Company\u2019s fixed income securities and its Equity Method Limited Liability Investments that exhibit debt-like characteristics, but it may adversely affect the Company\u2019s investment income as it invests cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio\u2019s average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may seek to refinance their borrowings at lower rates and, accordingly, prepay or redeem securities the Company holds as investments more quickly than the Company initially expected. Such prepayment or redemption action may cause the Company to reinvest the redeemed proceeds in lower yielding investments. An increase in interest rates would generally reduce the carrying value of a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, particularly fixed income securities and Equity Method Limited Liability Investments.\nThe Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities, which generally have more volatile returns than fixed income securities and may experience sustained periods of depressed values. There are multiple factors that could negatively impact the performance of the Company\u2019s equity portfolio, including general economic conditions, industry or sector deterioration and issuer-specific concerns. A decline in equity values may result in a decrease in dividend income, realized losses upon sales of the securities, or other-than-temporary impairment charges on securities still held.\nInterest rates and equity returns also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans. In addition to the impact on carrying values and yields of the underlying assets of the funded plans, interest rates also impact the discounting of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations of the plans. A decrease in interest rates may have a negative impact on the funded status of the plans.\nThe nature and cash flow needs of the Company and the insurance industry in general present certain liquidity risks that may impact the return of the investment portfolio. If the Company were to experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments to claimants, which could result in realized losses. Additionally, increases in illiquidity in the financial markets may increase uncertainty in the valuations of the Company\u2019s investments. This increases the risk that the fair values reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual price that may be obtained in an orderly sales transaction.\nThe Company has also benefited from certain tax laws related to its investment portfolio, including dividends received deductions and tax-exempt municipal securities. Changes in tax laws may have a detrimental effect on the after-tax return of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. A reduction in income tax rates also could also reduce the demand for tax-preference securities and result in a decline in the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio of such securities.\nThe Company\u2019s entire investment portfolio is subject to broad risks inherent in the financial markets, including, but not limited to, inflation, regulatory changes, inactive capital markets, governmental and social stability, economic outlooks, unemployment and recession. Changes to these risks and how the market perceives them may impact the financial\nperformance of the Company\u2019s investments.\nKemper and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy measurements that are significantly impacted by various characteristics of their invested assets, including, but not limited to, asset type, class, duration and credit rating. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to various limitations on the amounts at which they can invest in individual assets or certain asset classes in the aggregate. Asset risk is one factor used by insurance regulators and rating agencies to determine required capital for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, a deterioration in the quality of the investments held by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries or an increase in the investment risk inherent in their investment portfolios could increase capital requirements. See the risk factor below under the title \u201cThe ability of Kemper to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock may be materially impacted by lack of timely and/or sufficient dividends received from its subsidiaries.\u201d These factors may inhibit the Company from shifting its investment mix to produce higher returns. The Company is also subject to concentration of investment risk to the extent that the portfolio is heavily invested, at any particular time, in specific asset types, classes, industries, sectors or collateral types, among other defining features. Developments and the market\u2019s perception thereof in any of these concentrations may exacerbate the negative effects on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio compared to other companies.\nThe determination of the fair values of the Company\u2019s investments and whether a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary are based on management\u2019s judgment and may prove to be materially different than the actual economic outcome.\nThe Company holds a significant amount of assets without readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value cannot be measured from actively quoted prices. These assets are generally deemed to require a higher degree of judgment in measuring fair value. The assumptions used by management to measure fair values could turn out to be different than the actual amounts that may be realized in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant could be either lower or higher than the Company\u2019s estimates of fair value.\nThe Company reviews its investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary. This evaluation is based on subjective factors, assumptions and estimates and may be materially different than the actual economic outcome, which may result in the Company recognizing additional losses in the future as new information emerges or recognizing losses currently that may never materialize in the future in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant.\nEstimating losses and LAE for determining property and casualty insurance reserves, or determining premium rates, is inherently uncertain, and the Company\u2019s results of operations may be materially impacted if the Company\u2019s insurance reserves or premium rates are insufficient.\nThe Company establishes loss and LAE reserves to cover estimated liabilities, which remain unpaid as of the end of each accounting period, and to investigate and settle all claims incurred under the property and casualty insurance policies that it has issued. Loss and LAE reserves are established for claims that have been reported to the Company as of the end of the accounting period, as well as for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The estimates of loss and LAE reserves are based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, as well as estimates of the impact of future trends in the severity of claims, the frequency of claims and other factors.\nThe process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves is complex and imprecise. The reserves established by the Company are inherently uncertain estimates and could prove to be inadequate to cover its ultimate losses and expenses for insured events that have occurred. The estimate of the ultimate cost of claims for insured events that have occurred must take into consideration many factors that are dependent on the outcome of future events associated with the reporting, investigation and settlement of claims. The impacts on the Company\u2019s estimates of property and casualty insurance reserves from these factors are difficult to assess accurately. A change in any one or more of the factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate loss that is different than the previous projected ultimate loss and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s estimate of the projected ultimate loss. Increases in the estimates of ultimate losses and LAE will decrease earnings, while decreases in such estimates will increase earnings, as reported by the Company in the results of its operations for the periods in which the changes to the estimates are made by the Company. See MD&A, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates,\u201d under the caption \u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d beginning on page 57 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company\u2019s actuaries in estimating the Company\u2019s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves.\nThe Company\u2019s actuaries also consider trends in the severity and frequency of claims and other factors when determining the premium rates to charge for its property and casualty insurance products. An unanticipated change in any one or more of these\nfactors or trends, as well as a change in competitive conditions, may also result in inadequate premium rates charged for insurance policies issued by Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in the future. Such pricing inadequacies could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe ability of Kemper to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock may be materially impacted by lack of timely and/or sufficient dividends received from its subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, Kemper depends on the dividend income that it receives from its subsidiaries as the primary source of funds to pay interest and principal on its outstanding debt obligations, to pay dividends to its shareholders and to make repurchases of its stock. Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. In addition, third-party rating agencies monitor statutory capital and surplus levels for capital adequacy. Even though a dividend may be payable without regulatory approval, an insurance subsidiary may forgo paying a dividend to Kemper and retain the capital in its insurance subsidiaries to maintain or improve the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, or to offset increases in required capital from increases in premium volume or investment risk. The inability of one or more of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper\u2019s ability to pay its debt obligations on time, to pay dividends to its shareholders or make repurchases of its stock.", "PERMNO": 76136, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "KMPR"}
