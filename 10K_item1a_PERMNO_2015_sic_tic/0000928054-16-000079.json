{"cik": "928054", "company": "FLOTEK INDUSTRIES INC/CN/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Readers of this report should not consider any descriptions of these risk factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect Flotek. These factors should be carefully considered together with the other information contained in this Report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Further, many of these risks are interrelated and, as a result, the occurrence of certain risks could trigger and/or exacerbate other risks. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nThis Annual Report contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements discuss Company prospects, expected revenue, expenses and profits, strategic and operational initiatives, and other activities. Forward-looking statements also contain suppositions regarding future oil and natural gas industry conditions within both domestic and international market economies. The Company\u2019s results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including risks described below\nand elsewhere. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon domestic and international oil and natural gas industry spending. Spending could be adversely affected by industry conditions or by new or increased governmental regulations beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company is dependent upon customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures for exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in both North American and global markets. Customers\u2019 expectations of a decline in future oil and natural gas market prices could result in curtailed spending thereby reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which the Company has no control, including the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the consequential effect on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the activity levels of the Company\u2019s\ncustomers. One indicator of drilling and production spending is fluctuation in rig count, which the Company actively monitors to gauge market conditions and forecast product and service demand. A reduction in drilling activity could cause a decline in the demand for, or negatively affect the price of, some of the Company\u2019s products and services. Domestic demand for oil and natural gas could also be uniquely affected by public attitude regarding drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, vehicle emissions and other environmental standards, alternative fuels, taxation of oil and gas, perception of \u201cexcess profits\u201d of oil and gas companies, and anticipated changes in governmental regulation and policy.\nDemand for a significant number of the Company\u2019s products and services is dependent on the level of expenditures within the oil and natural gas industry. If current global economic conditions and the availability of credit worsen or oil and natural gas prices weaken for an extended period of time, reductions in customers\u2019 expenditures could have a significant adverse effect on revenue, margins and overall operating results.\nThe global economic environment could impact worldwide demand for energy. Crude oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices could impact customers\u2019 spending for the Company\u2019s products and services. Demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is dependent upon the level of expenditures within the oil and gas industry for exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Expenditures are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices, as well as the industry\u2019s outlook regarding future oil and natural gas prices.\nThe price for oil and natural gas is subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nGlobal demand for energy as a result of population growth, economic development, and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and the impact of non-OPEC producers on global supply;\n\u2022\navailability and quantity of natural gas storage;\n\u2022\nimport and export volumes and pricing of liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\npipeline capacity to critical markets;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and socio-political unrest;\n\u2022\ncost of exploration, production and transport of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances impacting energy production and consumption; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions.\nIncreased competition could also exert downward pressure on prices charged for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nVolatile economic conditions could weaken customer exploration and production expenditures, causing reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results. It is difficult to predict the pace of industry growth, the direction of oil and natural gas prices, the direction and magnitude of economic activity, and to what extent these conditions could affect the Company. However, reduced cash flow and capital availability could adversely impact the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers, which could result in customer project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to the Company. This could cause a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, if certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers were to experience significant cash flow constraints or become insolvent as a result of such conditions, a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could occur, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and term loan have variable interest rates that could increase.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a $75 million revolving credit facility commitment subject to collateral availability limits. The interest rate on advances under the revolving credit facility varies based on the level of borrowing. Rates range (a) between PNC Bank\u2019s base lending rate plus 0.5% to 1.0% or (b) between the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.5% to 2.0%. The Company is required to pay a monthly facility fee of 0.25% on any unused amount under the commitment based on daily averages. The current credit facility remains in effect until May 10, 2018.\nThe Company borrowed $50.0 million under a term loan on May 10, 2013. The interest rate on the term loan varies based on the level of borrowing under the revolving credit facility. Rates range (a) between PNC Bank\u2019s base lending rate plus 1.25% to 1.75% or (b) between the London Interbank Lending Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.25% to 2.75%.\nThere can be no assurance that the revolving credit facility and the term loan will not experience significant interest rate increases.\nNetwork disruptions, security threats and activity related to global cyber-crime pose risks to our key operational, reporting and communication systems.\nThe company relies on access to information systems for its operations. Failures of or interference with access to these systems, such as network communications disruptions could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or directly impact consolidated reporting. Security breaches pose a risk to confidential data and intellectual property which could result in damages to our competitiveness and reputation. The company has policies and procedures in place, including\nsystem monitoring and data back-up processes, to prevent or mitigate the effects of these potential disruptions or breaches, however there can be no assurance that existing or emerging threats will not have an adverse impact on our systems or communications networks.\nIf the Company does not manage the potential difficulties associated with expansion successfully, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has grown over the last several years through internal growth, strategic alliances, and strategic business and asset acquisitions. The Company believes future success will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to adapt to market opportunities and changes and to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses acquired. Factors that could result in strategic business difficulties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nlack of experienced management personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burdens;\n\u2022\nlack of customer retention;\n\u2022\ntechnological obsolescence;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure, technological, communication and logistical problems associated with large, expansive operations; and\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively integrate acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nIf the Company fails to manage potential difficulties successfully, including increased costs associated with growth, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to grow and compete could be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available.\nThe ability of the Company to grow and be competitive in the market place is dependent on the availability of adequate capital. Access to capital is dependent, in large part, on the Company\u2019s cash flows and the availability of and access to equity and debt financing. The Company\u2019s term and revolving loan agreements with its bank require approval and place limits on certain capital transactions and various business acquisitions and combinations. The Company cannot guarantee that cash flows will be sufficient, or that the Company will continue to be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, the Company may not be able to finance strategic growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or to respond to competitive pressures.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to develop and/or introduce new products or differentiate existing products could have an adverse effect on its ability to be responsive to customers\u2019 needs and could result in a loss of customers, as well as adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future success and profitability.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by technological advancements that have historically resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the scope and quality of oilfield chemistries, drilling and artificial lift products and services function and performance. Consequently, the Company\u2019s future success is dependent, in part, upon the Company\u2019s continued ability to timely develop innovative products and services. Increasingly sophisticated customer needs and the ability to anticipate and respond to technological and operational advances in the oil and natural gas industry is critical. If the Company fails to successfully develop and introduce innovative products and services that appeal to customers, or if existing or new market competitors develop superior products and services, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could deteriorate.\nConsumer and industrial chemistry markets that purchase the Company\u2019s citrus-based products are largely influenced by consumer preference and regulatory requirements. While citrus-based beverage flavorings, retail cleaning products, and fine fragrances perpetually rank high in consumer surveys, the Company\u2019s continued success requires new product innovation to keep pace with consumer trends and regulatory issues. If the Company fails to provide innovative products and services to its customers or to introduce performance products that comply with new environmental regulations, the Company\u2019s financial performance could be impacted.\nThe Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s past and potential future acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Negotiations of potential acquisitions or integration of newly acquired businesses could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns as well as be cost prohibitive and time consuming. Acquisitions could also expose the Company to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with new markets or businesses. Unforeseen operational difficulties related to acquisitions could result in diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources. Additionally, acquisitions could result in the commitment of capital resources without the realization of anticipated returns.\nUnforeseen contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company is, and from time to time may become, a party to legal proceedings incidental to the Company\u2019s business involving alleged injuries arising from the use of Company products, exposure to hazardous substances, patent infringement, employment matters, commercial disputes, and shareholder lawsuits. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses, divert management\u2019s attention, and may require the Company to pay damages that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that the Company may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect against potential loss exposures.\nThe Company\u2019s current insurance policies may not adequately protect the Company\u2019s business from all potential risks.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires, severe weather, oil and chemical spills, and other hazards. These conditions can result in personal injury or loss of life, damage to property, equipment and the environment, as well as suspension of customers\u2019 oil and gas operations. These events could result in damages requiring costly repairs, the interruption of Company business, including the loss of revenue and profits, and/or the Company being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. The Company maintains insurance coverage it believes is adequate and customary to the oil and natural gas services industry to mitigate liabilities associated with these potential hazards. The Company does not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to complex foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which expose the Company to liabilities that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to, among other things, the protection of natural resources, injury, health and safety considerations, waste management, and transportation of waste and other hazardous materials. The Company\u2019s operations expose the Company to risks of environmental liability that could result in fines, penalties, remediation, property damage, and personal injury liability. In order to remain compliant with laws and regulations, the Company maintains permits, authorizations and certificates as required from regulatory authorities. Sanctions for noncompliance with such laws and regulations could include assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits, and issuance of corrective action orders.\nThe Company could incur substantial costs to ensure compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Laws protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and are expected to continue to evolve and become more complex and restrictive into the future. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in material expense associated with future environmental compliance and remediation. The Company\u2019s costs of compliance could also increase if existing laws and regulations are amended or reinterpreted. Such amendments or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for, and production of, oil and natural gas which, in turn, could limit demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Some environmental laws and regulations could also\nimpose joint and strict liability, meaning that the Company could be exposed in certain situations to increased liabilities as a result of the Company\u2019s conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Remediation expense and other damages arising as a result of such laws and regulations could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial levels of the Company\u2019s revenue are derived from customers engaged in hydraulic fracturing services, a process that creates fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable natural gas or oil to flow more easily through the rock pores to a production well. Some states have adopted regulations which require operators to publicly disclose certain non-proprietary information. These regulations could require the reporting and public disclosure of the Company\u2019s proprietary chemistry formulas. The adoption of any future federal or state laws or local requirements, or the implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process, could increase the difficulty of oil and natural gas well production activity and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and/or climate change could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nCertain scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which include carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributory to the warming effect of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing worldwide attention. Legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions have not yet been finalized as of the date of this Annual Report but remain impactive across international, national, regional, and state levels.\nExisting or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including energy conservation or alternative energy incentives, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations, if regulations resulted in a reduction in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or global economic activity. Other results could be increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions, each of which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nChanges in regulatory compliance obligations of critical suppliers may adversely impact our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), signed into law on July 21, 2010, includes Section 1502, which requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or\n\u201cconflict minerals,\u201d for which such conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC-reporting company. The metals covered by these rules, which were adopted on August 22, 2012, include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. The Company and Company suppliers use some of these materials in their production processes.\nIn 2014, the Company established management systems and processes and completed due diligence in compliance with the requirements of Section 1502. In May 2014 the Company filed its first annual Conflict Minerals Report with the SEC. Future requirements for conducting Conflict Minerals due diligence may result in significant increased costs to the Company. Furthermore, failure of key suppliers to provide evidence of conflict free materials could impact the Company\u2019s ability to acquire key raw materials and/or result in higher costs for those raw materials.\nIf the Company is unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights or is found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, the Company\u2019s business is likely to be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, and other security measures to establish and protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights. Although the Company believes that existing measures are reasonably adequate to protect intellectual property rights, there is no assurance that the measures taken will prevent misappropriation of proprietary information or dissuade others from independent development of similar products or services. Moreover, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to prevent competitors from copying, reverse engineering, modifying, or otherwise obtaining and/or using the Company\u2019s technology and proprietary rights to create competitive products or services. The Company may not be able to enforce intellectual property rights outside of the U.S. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which the Company\u2019s products and services are manufactured or marketed may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Finally, other third parties may infringe, challenge, invalidate, or circumvent the Company\u2019s patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. In each case, the Company\u2019s ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s products and services are without patent protection. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee validity or enforceability. The Company\u2019s patents may not necessarily be valid or enforceable against third parties. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee that the Company has the right to use the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent the Company from marketing the Company\u2019s own patented products and services and utilizing the Company\u2019s patented technology.\nThe Company is exposed and may be exposed to allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement from\nothers. The Company may allege infringement of its patents and other intellectual property rights against others. Under either scenario, the Company could become involved in costly litigation or other legal proceedings regarding its patent or other intellectual property rights, from both an enforcement and defensive standpoint. Even if the Company chooses to enforce its patent or other intellectual property rights against a third party, there may be risk that the Company\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights become invalidated or otherwise unenforceable through legal proceedings. If intellectual property infringement claims are asserted against the Company, the Company could defend itself from such assertions or could seek to obtain a license under the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in order to mitigate exposure. In the event the Company cannot obtain a license, third parties could file lawsuits or other legal proceedings against the Company, seeking damages (including treble damages) or an injunction against the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of the Company\u2019s products and services. These could result in the Company having to discontinue the use, manufacture, and sale of certain products and services, increase the cost of selling certain products and services, or result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. An award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction order against the use, manufacture, and sale of any of the Company\u2019s products and services found to be infringing, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete.\nThe Company and the Company\u2019s customers are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including political risk, foreign exchange risk and other uncertainties.\nRevenue from the sale of products to customers outside the U.S. has been steadily increasing. The Company and its customers are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ngovernmental instability;\n\u2022\ncorruption;\n\u2022\nwar and other international conflicts;\n\u2022\ncivil and labor disturbances;\n\u2022\nrequirements of local ownership;\n\u2022\npartial or total expropriation or nationalization;\n\u2022\ncurrency devaluation; and\n\u2022\nforeign laws and policies, each of which can limit the movement of assets or funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or appropriation of property without fair compensation.\nCollections and recovery of rental tools from international customers and agents could also prove difficult due to inherent uncertainties in foreign law and judicial procedures. The Company could experience significant difficulty with collections or recovery due to the political or judicial climate in foreign countries where Company operations occur or in which the Company\u2019s products are used.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations must be compliant with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other applicable U.S. laws. The Company could become liable under these laws for actions taken by employees or agents. Compliance with international laws and regulations could become more complex and expensive thereby creating increased risk as the Company\u2019s international business portfolio grows. Further, the U.S. periodically enacts laws and imposes regulations prohibiting or restricting trade with certain nations. The U.S. government could also change these laws or enact new laws that could restrict or prohibit the Company from doing business in identified foreign countries. The Company conducts, and will continue to conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Historically, the Company has not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s profitability could be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company has no control over, and can provide no assurances that future laws and regulations will not materially impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct international business.\nThe loss of key customers could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could result in a decline in the Company\u2019s revenue.\nThe Company has critical customer relationships which are dependent upon production and development activity related to a handful of customers. Revenue derived from the Company\u2019s three largest customers as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, totaled 35%, 29%, and 30%, respectively. Customer relationships are historically governed by purchase orders or other short-term contractual obligations as opposed to long-term contracts. The loss of one or more key customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could result in a decline in the Company\u2019s revenue.\nFailure to collect for goods and services sold to key customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe Company performs credit analysis on potential customers; however credit analysis does not provide full assurance that customers will be willing and/or able to pay for goods and services purchased from the Company. Furthermore, collectability of international sales can be subject to the laws of foreign countries which may provide more limited protection to the Company in the event of a dispute over payment. Since sales to domestic and international customers are generally made on an unsecured basis, there can be no assurance of collectability. If one or more major customers are unwilling or unable to pay its debts to the Company, it could have an adverse effect of the Company\u2019s financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nLoss of key suppliers, the inability to secure raw materials on a timely basis, or the Company\u2019s inability to pass\ncommodity price increases on to customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to service customer\u2019s needs and could result in a loss of customers.\nMaterials used in servicing and manufacturing operations as well as those purchased for sale are generally available on the open market from multiple sources. Acquisition costs and transportation of raw materials to Company facilities have historically been impacted by extreme weather conditions. Certain raw materials used by the Energy Chemistries Technologies segment are available only from limited sources; accordingly, any disruptions to critical suppliers\u2019 operations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations. Prices paid for raw materials could be affected by energy, steel and other commodity prices; tariffs and duties on imported materials; foreign currency exchange rates; phases of the general business cycle and global demand. The Drilling Technologies and Production Technologies segments purchase critical raw materials on the open market and, where able, from multiple suppliers, both domestically and internationally.\nThe Company maintains a three- to six-month supply of critical mud-motor inventory parts that the Company sources from China. This inventory stock position approximates the lead time required to secure these parts in order to avoid disruption of service to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company\u2019s inability to secure reasonably priced critical inventory parts in a timely manner would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to provide service to potential customers. The Company sources the vast majority of motor parts from a national supplier. The Company is actively managing and developing relationships with back-up parts and service suppliers.\nThe Company currently does not hedge commodity prices. The Company may be unable to pass along price increases to its customers, which could result in a decline in revenue or operating profits.\nIf the Company loses the services of key members of management, the Company may not be able to manage operations and implement growth strategies.\nThe Company depends on the continued service of the Chief Executive Officer and President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Executive Vice President, Operations, the Executive Vice President, Research and Development, and other key members of the executive management team, who possess significant expertise and knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and industry. Furthermore, the Chief Executive Officer and President serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Company has entered into employment agreements with all of these key members; however, at December 31, 2015 the Company only carries key man life insurance for the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President of Operations. Any loss or interruption of the services of key members of the Company\u2019s management could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s ability to manage operations effectively and implement strategic business initiatives. The Company\ncan provide no assurance that appropriate replacements for key positions could be found should the need arise.\nFailure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or effectively prevent fraud, the Company\u2019s reputation and operating results could be harmed. If the Company is unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to provide reliable financial reports, which in turn could affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, limit the ability of the Company to access capital markets in the future, and require additional costs to improve internal control systems and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are subject to audit by tax authorities. Taxing authorities may make claims for back taxes, interest, and penalties.\nThe Company is subject to income, property, excise, employment, and other taxes in the U.S. and a variety of other jurisdictions around the world. Tax rules and regulations in the U.S. and around the world are complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, taxing authorities conduct audits of the Company\u2019s tax filings and may make claims for increased taxes and, in some case, assess interest and penalties. The assessments for back taxes, interest, and penalties could be significant. If the Company is unsuccessful in contesting these claims, the resulting payments could result in a drain on the Company\u2019s capital resources and liquidity.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nGeneral economic declines (recessions) and limits to credit availability could have an adverse effect on exploration and production activity and result in lower demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nContinued worldwide financial and credit uncertainty can reduce the availability of liquidity and credit markets to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. The shortage of liquidity and credit combined with pressure on worldwide equity markets could continue to impact the worldwide economic climate. Unrest in the Middle East or other regions of the world may also impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services both domestically and internationally.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services is dependent on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is particularly sensitive to levels of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. One indication of drilling and production activity and spending is rig count, which the Company monitors to gauge market conditions. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or drop in rig count could depress current levels of exploration, development, and production activity. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas well products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer and industrial customers would be adversely affected if economic activity decreased dramatically. The Company\u2019s primary product is often used to replace less desirable solvents in numerous consumer and industrial applications and is often more expensive than other materials. As economic activity decreases, consumer and industrial companies not only consume less solvent, they also may relax their environmental preferences and purchase cheaper solvents. The Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted if demand softens because of weak economic activity.\nEvents in global credit markets can significantly impact the availability of credit and associated financing costs for many of the Company\u2019s customers. Many of the Company\u2019s customers finance their drilling and production programs through third-party lenders or public debt offerings. Lack of available credit or increased costs of borrowing could cause customers to reduce spending on drilling programs, thereby reducing demand and potentially resulting in lower prices for the Company\u2019s products and services. Also, the credit and economic environment could significantly impact the financial condition of some customers over a prolonged period, leading to business disruptions and restricted ability to pay for the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company\u2019s forward-looking statements assume that the Company\u2019s lenders, insurers, and other financial institutions will be able to fulfill their obligations under various credit agreements, insurance policies, and contracts. If any of the Company\u2019s significant lenders, insurers and others are unable to perform under such agreements, and if the Company was unable to find suitable replacements at a reasonable cost, the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nA continuing period of depressed oil and natural gas prices could result in further reductions in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile. Such volatility in oil and natural gas prices, or the perception by the Company\u2019s customers of unpredictability in oil and natural gas prices, could adversely affect spending. The oil and natural gas markets may be volatile in the future. The demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is, in large part, driven by general levels of exploration and production spending and drilling activity by its customers. Recent decreases in oil and natural gas prices have caused a decline in exploration and drilling activities, and a continuing period of depressed oil and gas prices or further decreases could cause further declines in exploration and production activities. This, in turn, could result in lower demand in the future for the Company\u2019s products and services and could result in lower prices for the Company\u2019s products and services. Further declines in oil or natural gas prices could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew and existing competitors within the Company\u2019s industries could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. The Company\u2019s principal competitors include numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in the Company\u2019s markets on a local basis, as well as a number of large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than does the Company. Larger competitors may be able to devote greater resources to developing, promoting and selling products and services. The Company may also face increased competition due to the entry of new competitors including current suppliers that decide to sell their products and services directly to the Company\u2019s customers. As a result of this competition, the Company could experience lower sales or greater operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s margins and results of operations.\nRegulatory pressures, environmental activism, and legislation could result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulations restricting volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) exist in many states and/or communities which limit demand for certain products. Although citrus oil is considered a VOC, its health, safety, and environmental profile is preferred over other solvents (e.g., BTEX), which is currently creating new market opportunities around the world. Changes in the perception of citrus oils as a preferred VOC, increased consumer activism against hydraulic fracturing or other regulatory or legislative actions by governments could\npotentially result in materially reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s industry has a high rate of employee turnover. Difficulty attracting or retaining personnel or agents could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company operates in an industry that has historically been highly competitive in securing qualified personnel with the required technical skills and experience. The Company\u2019s services require skilled personnel able to perform physically demanding work. Due to industry volatility, the demanding nature of the work, and the need for industry specific knowledge and technical skills, current employees could choose to pursue employment opportunities outside the Company that offer a more desirable work environment and/or higher compensation than is offered by the Company. As a result of these competitive labor conditions, the Company may not be able to find qualified labor, which could limit the Company\u2019s growth. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining qualified personnel has increased over the past several years due to competitive pressures. In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, the Company may be required to offer increased wages and benefits. If the Company is unable to increase the prices of products and services to compensate for increases in compensation, or is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, operating results could be adversely affected.\nSevere weather could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather conditions. Hurricanes, tropical storms, flash floods, blizzards, cold weather and other severe weather conditions could result in curtailment of services, damage to equipment and facilities, interruption in transportation of products and materials, and loss of productivity. If the Company\u2019s customers are unable to operate or are required to reduce operations due to severe weather conditions, and as a result curtail purchases of the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflicts involving the U.S. could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent the Company from meeting financial and other obligations. The Company could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors, or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Terrorist activities\nand the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, impair the ability to raise capital, or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize certain business strategies.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Securities\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has historically been subject to significant fluctuations. The following factors, among others, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate significantly due to:\n\u2022\nvariations in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of companies in the Company\u2019s industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volume;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nissuances of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors of new business, acquisitions, or joint ventures; and\n\u2022\nnegative statements made by external parties, about the Company\u2019s business, in public forums.\nThe stock market has experienced unusual price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the price of common stock of companies within many industries including the oil and natural gas industry. Further changes can occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little to do with the Company\u2019s operational performance, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the Company\u2019s stock price. The Company could be a defendant in a legal case related to a significant loss of value for the shareholders. This could be expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and Company resources, as well as have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAn active market for the Company\u2019s common stock may not continue to exist or may not continue to exist at current trading levels.\nTrading volume for the Company\u2019s common stock historically has been very volatile when compared to companies with larger market capitalizations. The Company cannot presume that an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will continue or be sustained. Sales of a significant number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market could lower the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company has no plans to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, and, therefore, investors will have to look to stock appreciation for return on investments.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock within the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of the Company\u2019s business and to meet current debt obligations. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend, among other things, on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations deemed relevant by the board of directors. Additionally, should the Company seek future financing or refinancing of indebtedness, covenants could restrict the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of lenders. Investors must rely on sales of common stock held after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on their investment.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of the Company\u2019s charter documents and applicable Delaware law could discourage or prevent others from acquiring the Company, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit the Company to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of the series;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits business combinations with owners of more than 15% of the Company\u2019s stock without the approval of the board of directors. Aforementioned provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company exclusive of negotiation. The Company\u2019s board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer deemed not beneficial to or synergistic with the Company\u2019s strategic outlook. If an acquirer were discouraged from offering to acquire the Company or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these anti-takeover measures, stockholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nFuture issuance of additional shares of common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company may, in the future, issue previously authorized and unissued shares of common stock, which would result in the dilution of current stockholders ownership interests. The Company is currently authorized to issue 80,000,000 shares of common stock. Additional shares are subject to issuance through various equity compensation plans or through the exercise of currently outstanding options. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in order to raise capital or effectuate other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSubject to the rules of the NYSE, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and to set the terms of the issuance without seeking approval from holders of common stock. Currently, there are 100,000 preferred shares authorized, with no shares currently outstanding. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank senior to common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums, and may have greater voting rights than holders of common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and tax attribute carryforwards to offset\nfuture taxable income may be limited as a result of transactions involving the Company\u2019s common stock.\nUnder section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to utilize pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). An ownership change could limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize existing NOLs and tax attribute carryforwards for taxable years including or following an identified \u201cownership change.\u201d Transactions involving the Company\u2019s common stock, even those outside the Company\u2019s control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require the Company to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of that which would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect. Net operating losses and tax attributes could expire unused, in each instance reducing or eliminating the benefit of the NOLs and tax attributes. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nDisclaimer of Obligation to Update\nExcept as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company assumes no obligation (and specifically disclaims any such obligation) to update these risk factors or any other forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 90783, "SIC": 2891, "TIC": "FTK"}
