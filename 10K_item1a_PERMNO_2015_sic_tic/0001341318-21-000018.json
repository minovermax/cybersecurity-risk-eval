{"cik": "1341318", "company": "LAKE SHORE BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\ufeff\nIn analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in the Company, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors. The risks listed here may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem immaterial, could also have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects:\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe widespread outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, the global economy, United States economy, our local economy and our markets and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact economic and commercial activity and financial markets, both globally and within the United States. Early in the pandemic, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, and mass layoffs and furloughs. Though these early restrictions have been generally lifted or eased, continuing capacity restrictions and health and safety recommendations that discourage travel and encourage continued social distancing and tele-work have limited the ability of businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity and employment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the Company\u2019s business and is likely to continue to do so. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has:\n\u00b7\ncaused some of the Company\u2019s borrowers to be unable to meet existing payment obligations, particularly those borrowers more severely impacted by business shutdowns and travel restrictions;\n\u00b7\nrequired the Company to significantly increase its allowance for loan losses, which had an impact on 2020 net income; and\n\u00b7\ncaused changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits, which has resulted in significant deposit growth, and increased liquidity in a low rate interest environment.\nCertain actions taken by U.S. or other governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, that are intended to mitigate the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on our business operations. During the 1st quarter of 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 0.00% to 0.25%, which was a 150 basis\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npoints decrease from the target range in the 4th quarter of 2019. Market interest rates have decreased since March 2020, resulting in net interest margin compression for our Company.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately affect our business is unknown and will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate its effects, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been developed and the ability of pharmaceutical companies and governments to manufacture and distribute those vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume.\nWe are subject to regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding our participation in the PPP and we are subject to the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees. The CARES Act included the PPP as a loan program administered through the SBA. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals were able to apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. Also, there was and continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although we believe that we have administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, we may be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention related to our participation in the PPP. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators, and U.S. Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling us to rely on borrower certifications, and take more aggressive action against us for alleged violations of the provisions governing the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition, and thereby adversely affect your investment.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nThe Company has granted payment deferrals to borrowers that have experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19, and if those borrowers are unable to resume making payments the Company will experience an increase in non-accrual loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition. Consistent with the encouragement provided by federal and state banking regulators and by the CARES Act, the Company has worked constructively with borrowers who have experienced financial hardship resulting from the pandemic and negotiated accommodations or forbearance arrangements that temporarily reduce or defer the monthly payments due to the Company. Generally, these accommodations are for three to six months and allow customers to temporarily cease making principal and/or interest payments. In some cases, customers have received second and third accommodations. Through December 31, 2020, the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompany granted accommodations with respect to loans for a total of approximately $103.1 million, and as of December 31, 2020, $23.8 million remained subject to a payment accommodation. The Company did not report loans with deferrals granted due to the pandemic as past due loans at December 31, 2020, in accordance with the accounting guidance included in the interagency regulatory guidance from a joint interagency statement titled the \u201cInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\u201d which was issued by the Company\u2019s banking regulators and other financial regulators, on March 22, 2020 and revised April 7, 2020. Appropriate allowances for loan and lease losses have been maintained on loans with payment deferrals. Upon the expiration of the deferral period, borrowers are required to resume making previously scheduled loan payments. It is possible that some borrowers may be unable to make timely loan payments after their deferral period ends, in which case their loan will be classified as non-accrual and the Company will begin collection activities. Non-performing loans and related charge-offs may increase as payment deferrals expire and the impact of government stimulus programs wanes. An increase in non-performing loans and related charge-offs would cause the Company to increase is allowance for loan losses, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nCustomary means to collect non-performing assets may be prohibited or impractical during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is a risk that collateral securing a non-performing asset may deteriorate if the Company chooses not to, or is unable to, foreclose on collateral in a timely manner. Beginning in March 2020, we suspended foreclosure sales of primary residential property. Federal banking agencies and government entities, including New York State, have adopted regulations or put in place executive orders that restrict or limit our ability to take certain actions with respect to delinquent borrowers that we would otherwise have taken in the ordinary course of business, such as customary collection and foreclosure activities. For example, New York State has placed a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on evictions and foreclosures and the moratorium has recently been extended through May 1, 2021 for people experiencing a hardship related to COVID-19. If the moratorium is extended further, or if the backlog of foreclosure cases are not processed efficiently, there is an increased risk that the collateral value may deteriorate, resulting in a loss to the Company.\nRisks Related to Economic and Credit Risks\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss. Our business strategy is to increase our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios. Commercial real estate (including commercial construction) and commercial business loans comprised in the aggregate 62.1% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. These types of loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u00b7\nCommercial Business Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business\n\ufeff\nA deterioration in economic conditions in our market areas due to the long-term impacts of COVID-19 could affect the performance of our loan portfolio. Higher prices for businesses and consumers and high unemployment could negatively affect our loan portfolio, if business owners or consumers are not able to make loan payments. The long-term impact of COVID-19 could lead to a downturn in the real estate market or our national or local economy which could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from our borrowers\u2019 businesses thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease. Our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We therefore may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. A downturn in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreal estate market or the local economy could exacerbate this risk. We review our allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis to ensure that it is funded adequately to cover any anticipated losses.\nMaterial additions to our allowance for loan losses also would materially decrease our net income, and the charge-off of loans may cause us to increase the allowance for loan losses. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. The Bank\u2019s increased focus on commercial loan originations has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses. If we were to further increase the amount of commercial loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make increased provisions for loan losses. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe results of our operations may be adversely affected if asset valuations cause other-than-temporary impairment charges. We may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities or other assets if they suffer declines in value that are considered other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio or other assets in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, its ability to pay dividends to shareholders, and its regulatory capital ratios.\nOur local economy may affect our future growth possibilities. Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our current market area, which is primarily located in Western New York, in particular within Erie and Chautauqua counties. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which we operate do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be negatively affected. This could lead to a deterioration in the credit quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of customer deposits, which in turn would hurt our business. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that may secure our loans could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s monetary or fiscal policies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our earnings will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Board has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of banks through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s actions affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence on other monetary and fiscal policies. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.\nRisks Related To Our Business Operations\nLow demand for real estate loans may lower our profitability. Making loans secured by real estate, including one- to four-family and commercial real estate, is our primary business and primary source of revenue. If customer demand for real estate loans decreases, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments, primarily securities, generally earn less income than real estate loans. Customer demand for loans secured by real estate could be reduced due to weaker economic conditions, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or an increase in interest rates. We experienced commercial loan growth during 2015 through 2019, especially in the Erie County market area, which had a positive impact\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\non net interest income. If interest rates rise, loan demand may slow down, and deposit expenses may increase, which could lower our profitability.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. We believe that our growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. Although we have an employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, that contains a non-compete provision, the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers and key personnel could impair our ability to continue to develop our business strategy.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to the Company. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, operations, compliance, strategic, and reputation risks. We additionally segregate and assess information technology and human resource risks due to their complexity and over-arching risk profiles. While we deploy a diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, including internal management and third-party engagement in risk processes, risk identification and mitigation processes are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer accounts, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. There have been increasing efforts to breach data security at financial institutions through cyber-attacks. Recently, there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of customer information or the destruction, ransom or theft of corporate data. We may be unable to proactively address these types of security breaches or to implement adequate preventative measures because the techniques used to cause these breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas throughout the world. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent, limit or mitigate the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed. We periodically review our security protocols and, as necessary, add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing. Additionally, we outsource our data processing to third parties. If the third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations. Furthermore, breaches of such third party\u2019s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers, through no fault of our own. Fraud attacks targeting customer-controlled devices, plastic payment card terminals, and merchant data collection points provide another source of potential loss, again through no fault of our own. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe regularly assess and test our systems, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remains a priority. The Company has developed a disaster recovery plan, which includes plans to maintain or resume operations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin the event of an emergency, such as a power outage or natural disaster, and contingency plans in the event that operations or systems cannot be resumed or restored. The disaster recovery plan is periodically reviewed and updated, and components of the disaster recovery plan are periodically tested and validated. The Company also reviews and evaluates the disaster recovery programs of vendors which provide certain third-party systems that the Company considers critical. The Company has obtained insurance protection intended to cover losses due to network security breaches; there is no guarantee, however, that such insurance would cover all costs associated with any breach, damage or failure of our computer systems and network infrastructure.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Furthermore, new payment services developed and offered by non-financial institution competitors pose an increasing threat to the traditional payment services offered by financial institutions. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and we may not be able to effectively deploy new technologies to improve our operational efficiency. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe results of our operations may be adversely affected by environmental conditions. During the course of making loans secured by real estate, we have acquired and may acquire in the future, property securing loans that are in default. There is a risk that we could be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition in a foreclosure action, and that we may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination. In addition, the owner or former owners of contaminated sites may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such property. An environmental assessment of real estate securing commercial loans is completed prior to loan closing. This initial assessment may indicate a higher level of testing is needed. The borrower is then required to have further testing and complete any remedial action recommended. To date, we have not been subject to any environmental claims. There can be no assurance, however, that this will remain the case in the future.\nOur ability to grow may be limited. We intend to seek to expand our banking franchise, organically and by acquiring other financial institutions or branches and other financial service providers if the right opportunity occurs. However, we have no specific plans for expansion or acquisitions at this time. Our ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying, acquiring and integrating those institutions or branches. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate organic growth or identify attractive acquisition candidates, make acquisitions on favorable terms or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches.\nChanges to LIBOR may adversely impact the interest rate paid on certain financial instruments.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for our interest rate swap product. In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Interbank Offered Rates (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the publication of LIBOR is not guaranteed beyond 2021. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to (i) cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and (ii) cease the publication of all other tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six and 12 month LIBOR) after June 30, 2023.\n\ufeff\nThere are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or \u201cSOFR\u201d) is considered the most likely alternative reference rate suitable for replacing LIBOR, but uncertainty remains as to the adoption, market acceptance or availability of SOFR or other alternative reference rates. The Company has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2020 Fallbacks Protocol for its interest rate swap agreements. At this time, it is not possible to predict what rate or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such changes on the interest rate received by the bank on its interest rate swap instruments.\n\ufeff\nCompetition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans. We operate in a competitive market for both attracting deposits, which is our primary source of funds, and originating loans. Our most direct competition for savings deposits has come from commercial banks, credit unions, savings banks and online banks. Competition has increased in our market areas as a result of new entrants to the Erie County market area. We face additional competition for depositors from non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, online retail mortgage lenders and other financial service companies. Competition for loan originations and deposits may limit our future growth and earnings prospects. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability will depend upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\n\ufeff\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or \u201cCECL\u201d, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we will need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Liquidity\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income.\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, we have generally been liability sensitive, which indicates that our liabilities generally re-price faster than assets. Our earnings may be adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates because the majority of our interest-earning assets are long-term, fixed rate mortgage-related assets that will not re-price as long-term interest rates increase. As rates rise, we expect loan applications to decrease, prepayment speeds to slow down and the interest rate on our loan portfolio to remain static. Conversely, a majority of our interest-bearing liabilities have much shorter contractual maturities and are expected to re-price, resulting in increased interest expense. A significant portion of our deposits have no contractual maturities and are likely to re-price quickly as short-term interest rates increase. Therefore, in an increasing rate environment, our cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than the yields earned on our loan and securities portfolios.\nChanges in market interest rates could also reduce the value of our interest-earning assets including, but not limited to, our securities portfolio. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. As such, declines in the fair value of such securities resulting from increases in market interest rates may adversely affect stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn a decreasing interest rate environment, our earnings may increase or decrease. If long-term interest-earning assets do not re-price and interest rates on short-term deposits begin to decrease, earnings may rise. However, low interest rates on loan products may result in an increase in prepayments, as borrowers refinance their loans. If we cannot re-invest the funds received from prepayments at a comparable spread, net interest income could be reduced. Also, in a falling interest rate environment, certain categories of deposits may reach a point where market forces prevent further reduction in interest paid on those products. The net effect of these circumstances is reduced net interest income and possibly net interest rate spread.\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity. \u201cLiquidity\u201d refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay our wholesale borrowings and other liabilities and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base, which is raised through our retail branch network. Core deposits - consisting of savings and money market accounts, time deposits less than $250,000 and demand deposits - comprised approximately 95.0% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. Additional available unused sources of liquidity include borrowings from the Federal Reserve of New York discount window, FHLB borrowings, and access to brokered deposits and lines of credit with correspondent banks. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $63.3 million at December 31, 2020.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and/or investment securities and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer deposits. Such deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, which would require us to seek wholesale funding alternatives in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the banking industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our strategic plan, including originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Investment in the Company\u2019s Stock\nWe expect that our return on equity will be low compared to other financial institutions as a result of our high level of capital. Return on average equity, which equals net income divided by average equity, is a ratio used by many investors to compare the performance of a particular company with other companies. Our return on equity may be low while we continue to leverage capital levels via organic growth of loans and deposits. We may manage excess capital through dividend payments and a stock repurchase program when cash availability and market prices make such purchases appropriate. As we implement our strategic plan to increase net interest income and non-interest income via organic growth, we expect our return on equity ratio to improve. Failure to achieve a competitive return on average equity might make an investment in our common stock unattractive to some investors and might cause our common stock to trade at lower prices than comparable financial institutions with higher returns on average equity.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and, as a result, shareholders and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), requires us to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and provide an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting, including, among other matters, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company has established a process to document and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations, which require management consideration of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis. In this regard, management has dedicated internal resources and adopted a detailed work plan to (i) assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) take steps to improve control processes, where appropriate, (iii) validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and (iv) maintain a continuous internal reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s management and Audit/Risk Committee have made the Company\u2019s compliance with Section 404 a high priority. The Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that the Company implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement appropriate new or improved controls in response to changes in financial processes or reporting, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meets its reporting obligations. If the Company fails to correct any significant deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or fails to prevent fraud, current and potential shareholders and depositors could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s financial reporting, which could harm its business and the trading price of its stock.\nPublic shareholders do not exercise voting control over us. A majority of our voting stock is owned by Lake Shore, MHC. Lake Shore, MHC is controlled by its Board of Directors, which consist of those persons who are members of the Board of Directors of Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore Savings. Lake Shore, MHC will determine the outcome of the election of the Board of Directors of Lake Shore Bancorp, and, as a general matter, controls the outcome of most matters presented to the shareholders of Lake Shore Bancorp for resolution by vote. Consequently, Lake Shore, MHC, acting through its Board of Directors, is able to control the business and operations of Lake Shore Bancorp and may be able to prevent any challenge to the ownership or control of Lake Shore Bancorp by shareholders other than Lake Shore, MHC. There is no assurance that Lake Shore, MHC will not take actions that the public shareholders believe are against their interests.\n\ufeff\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in Lake Shore Bancorp\u2019s common stock has been relatively small, averaging less than 3,000 shares per day during 2020. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related To Regulatory Compliance\n\ufeff\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. Lake Shore Savings, Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding companies may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of federal deposit insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Lake Shore Savings, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nimpact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and our interpretation of those changes.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of Lake Shore Savings to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp and the waiver of dividends by Lake Shore, MHC. The value of Lake Shore Bancorp\u2019s common stock is significantly affected by our ability to pay dividends to our public shareholders. Our long-term ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp, and also the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends. Under OCC safe harbor regulations, the Bank may distribute capital to Lake Shore Bancorp in an amount not exceeding net income for the current calendar period and the prior two calendar years. Our ability to pay dividends and the amount of such dividends is also affected by the ability of Lake Shore, MHC, our mutual holding company and majority shareholder of Lake Shore Bancorp, to waive the receipt of dividends declared by Lake Shore Bancorp. Lake Shore, MHC waived its right to receive most of its dividends on its shares of Lake Shore Bancorp since its inception in 2006. The ability to waive dividends meant that Lake Shore Bancorp had more cash resources to pay dividends to its public shareholders than if Lake Shore, MHC accepted such dividends. Lake Shore, MHC is now required to obtain a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board allowing it to waive its right to dividends.\nUnder Section 239.8(d) of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation MM governing dividend waivers, a mutual holding company may waive its right to dividends on shares of its subsidiary if the mutual holding company gives written notice of the waiver to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Board does not object. For a company such as Lake Shore, MHC, that was formed, issued stock and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board may not object to a dividend waiver if such waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the savings bank subsidiary and the board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly determines that such dividend waiver is consistent with the board\u2019s fiduciary duties to the members of the mutual holding company. Regulation MM also requires as a condition to waiving dividends, that a mutual holding company obtain the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of its members within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived.\nLake Shore, MHC solicited its members (the depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank) to vote on the proposal to waive dividends and on February 3, 2021, the members approved the waiver of dividends. The Board of Directors of Lake Shore, MHC subsequently approved a dividend waiver in accordance with the regulations and submitted it to the Federal Reserve Board for its non-objection. As of March 4, 2021, Lake Shore, MHC received notice of the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to waive its right to receive dividends paid by the Company during the twelve months ending February 3, 2022. It is expected that Lake Shore, MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund Lake Shore, MHC\u2019s continuing operations, subject to the ability of Lake Shore, MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and its ability to obtain future member approval of dividend waivers.\nWhile Lake Shore, MHC is grandfathered for purposes of the dividend waiver provisions of Regulation MM and has complied with all additional requirements imposed, we cannot predict whether the Federal Reserve Board will grant a dividend waiver request and, if granted, there can be no assurance as to the conditions, if any, the Federal Reserve Board will place on future dividend waiver requests by grandfathered mutual holding companies such as Lake Shore, MHC. If Lake Shore, MHC is unable to waive the receipt of dividends, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be substantially impaired and the amounts of any such dividends may be significantly reduced.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed, or it may only be available on unacceptable terms, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or be\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequired by our regulators to increase our capital resources. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations and pursue our growth strategy could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\n\ufeff\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations. Our operations are subject to tax by federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and reduced the Company\u2019s corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2018. If local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, this may result in a decrease or increase to our corporate income tax rates or changes to our net deferred tax position. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 91176, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "LSBK"}
