Risk Factors.\nA wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in Consumer Behavior, as Well as New Technologies, Distribution Platforms and Packaging, May Negatively Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nTechnology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams.\nTechnological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching their target audiences. For example, the evolution of consumer preferences away from linear pay television, away from physical towards digital services, and away from rental and purchased services towards subscription services, and the substantial increase in availability of programming without advertising or adequate methodologies for audience measurement, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies that enable users to fast-forward or circumvent advertisements, and substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers, adversely affecting our advertising revenue.\nIn response to perceived consumer demand, distributors of programming and program services are continuing to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including smaller, often customizable programming packages known as \u201cskinny bundles,\u201d which are delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings; SVOD services; ad-supported, free video-on-demand services; and original programming hosted on social media platforms. If these alternative offerings continue to gain traction and our networks and brands are not included in those packages and services, or if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional cable subscriptions, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for our programming, which could lead to lower affiliate and advertising revenues. These changing distribution models may also impact our ability to negotiate carriage deals on terms favorable to us, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the developments, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. Our inability to protect and exploit the value of our content, while adapting to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Businesses Operate in an Industry That Is Highly Competitive and Swiftly Consolidating\nCompanies in the television programming, film, digital, consumer products, live events and recreation businesses depend on the popularity of content and other offerings, appeal to advertisers and widespread distribution of their content. We compete with other media companies to attract creative talent and produce high quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms to draw large audiences. Competition for talent, content, audiences, advertising and distribution is intense and comes\nfrom broadcast television, other cable networks (including our own), OTT distributors, social media platforms, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from search, social networks, program guides and \u201csecond screen\u201d applications. Further, competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original programming, such as Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, continues to increase.\nOur ability to obtain widespread distribution on favorable terms, which contributes to our ability to attract audiences and, in turn, advertisers, is adversely affected by the consolidation of programmers, distributors (including telecom companies) and television service providers. This consolidation reduces the number of distributors with whom we negotiate and increases the negotiating leverage and market power of the combined companies. In addition, consolidation in the film business may adversely affect the distribution of our films on various platforms.\nIn addition, our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, whereas our Media Networks business generally relies on distribution relationships with third parties. As more cable and satellite operators, Internet service providers, telecom companies and other content distributors, aggregators and search providers create or acquire their own content, they may have significant competitive advantages, which could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms for distribution or otherwise compete effectively in the delivery marketplace. Our competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information, as well as significant financial resources.\nThis competition and consolidation could result in lower ratings and advertising, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting revenue and profitability for us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Maintain Attractive Brands and Produce Popular Programming, Films and Other Entertainment Content, Which Is Difficult to Predict\nOur ability to maintain attractive brands and generate popular entertainment content, successful tentpole events and consumer products, recreation and live events offerings are key to the success of our business and our ability to generate revenues. The production and distribution of programming, films and other entertainment content is inherently risky because the revenues we derive from various sources primarily depend on our ability to satisfy consumer tastes and expectations in a consistent manner. The popularity of our content is affected by our ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences, the quality and attractiveness of competing entertainment content and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, including online, mobile and other offerings. Audience tastes change frequently and it is a challenge to anticipate what offerings will be successful at any point in time. We invest substantial capital in our content, including in the production of original content on our networks, in our films and in our television production business, before learning the extent to which it will garner critical success and popularity with consumers.\nIn our Media Networks business, the popularity of our brands and programming has a significant impact on the revenues we are able to generate from advertising, affiliate fees, consumer products, and other licensing activities. Our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside the U.S. also impacts our ability to expand our presence internationally. In our Filmed Entertainment business, the theatrical performance of a film affects not only the theatrical revenues we receive but also those from other distribution channels, such as home entertainment, television, various other platforms and apps and licensed consumer products. As a result, a lack of popularity of our offerings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period or over a longer term.\nOur Advertising Revenues Have Been and May Continue to Be Adversely Impacted By Declines in Linear Television Viewing, Deficiencies in Audience Measurement and Advertising Market Conditions\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any given period.\nConsumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, and an increasing number of companies offer SVOD services, including some that offer exclusive high-quality original video programming and programming delivered directly to consumers over the Internet. The increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our cable networks and may adversely affect the pricing and volume of advertising.\nIn addition, advertising sales are largely dependent on audience measurement, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary for a variety of reasons, including the platforms on which viewing is measured and variations in the statistical sampling methods used. While Nielsen\u2019s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales, we measure and monetize our campaign reach and frequency on and across digital platforms based on other third-party data as well as first-party data using a variety of methods, including the number of impressions served and demographics. In addition, multi-platform campaign verification remains in its infancy, and viewership on tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, which continues to grow rapidly, still is not measured by any one consistently applied method. These variations and changes could have a significant effect on our advertising revenues.\nThe strength of the advertising market can also fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers\u2019 current spending priorities and the economy in general, and this may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. The pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts toward new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as advantageous to us as current advertising methods.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause We Derive a Significant Portion of Our Revenues from a Limited Number of Distributors, the Loss of Affiliation Agreements, Renewal on Less Favorable Terms or Adverse Interpretations Could Have a Significant Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of cable television, direct-to-home satellite television and telecommunications operators, subscription and advertising supported video-on-demand services, and other distributors of our programming and program services. Our affiliation agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including but not limited to those related to pricing and programming tiers. We may also be unable to modify existing agreements with terms that have over time become less favorable. The loss of favorable packaging and positioning, the loss of carriage on the most widely available cable and satellite programming tiers or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew or modify them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both advertising and affiliate fees.\nSimilarly, our revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding the interpretation, and even validity, of the agreements has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. For example, some of our distribution agreements contain \u201cmost favored nation\u201d (\u201cMFN\u201d) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes specified terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. These clauses are generally complex and may lead to disagreement over interpretation and application of such clause. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our revenues from both advertising and affiliate fees, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nService Disruptions or Failures of, or Cybersecurity Attacks Upon, Our or Our Vendors\u2019 Networks, Information Systems and Other Technologies Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential or Valuable Business or Personal Information, Disruption of Our Businesses, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses\nNetworks, information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films by us or our third-party vendors (\u201cSystems\u201d), are critical to our business activities, and shutdowns or service disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks upon, these Systems pose increasing risks. Such shutdowns, disruptions and attacks may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns,\ndisruptions and attacks from such events could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, our employees, our audiences and users of our online, mobile and app offerings, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to cover everything that could happen. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations, reduced revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nWe are also subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our third-party vendors\u2019 Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our Systems or those of our third-party vendors or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data, or our programming. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have increased in recent years. If a material breach of our Systems or those of our third-party vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our information security measures could be harmed, we could lose advertisers and other business partners as well as users of our online, mobile and app offerings and viewers, and our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. In addition, if a material breach of our Systems occurs, we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace such Systems or to comply with notification requirements. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation in the event of a breach of our or our third-party vendors\u2019 Systems.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, these Systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these preventative and detective measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nEach of these factors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Failure, Destruction and/or Breach of Satellites and Facilities that We Depend Upon to Distribute Our Programming Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nWe use satellite systems, fiber and other methods to transmit our program services to cable television operators and other distributors worldwide. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Notwithstanding certain back-up and redundant systems, transmissions may be disrupted as a result of power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming or other similar events. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming, and if a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that such failure or disruption would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTheft of Our Content, Including Digital Copyright Theft and Other Unauthorized Exhibitions of Our Content, May Decrease Revenue Received from Our Programming, Films and Other Entertainment Content and Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nThe success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights in our entertainment content. We are fundamentally a content company and theft of our brands, films and home entertainment products, television programming, digital content and other intellectual property affects us and the value of our content. Copyright theft is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective copyright and technical protective measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe and/or lack effective enforcement of such measures. Such foreign copyright theft often creates a supply of pirated content for major markets as well. The interpretation of copyright, piracy and other laws as applied to our content, and our piracy detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of copyright enforcement have encountered political opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and negatively affect its value.\nContent theft is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to cloak their identities online. In addition, we and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. For example, non-browser-based content theft through Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices continues to increase and includes illegal re-transmission platforms, OTT subscription services, illicit video-on-demand/streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming pirated film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films or television shows as well as a reduction in legitimate audiences, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected programming and our ability to monetize our content.\nCopyright theft has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public\u2019s and some affiliate partners\u2019 perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. While legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to engage in copyright theft continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these efforts. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased Costs for Programming, Films and Other Rights, and Judgments We Make on the Potential Performance of our Content, May Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nIn our Media Networks segment, we have historically produced a significant amount of original programming and other content, and as part of our business strategy we invest significant resources in our flagship brands, in part with the aim of developing higher quality and quantity of original content. In our Filmed Entertainment business, we invest significant amounts in the production, marketing and distribution of films and television series.\nWe also acquire programming, films and television series, as well as a variety of digital content and other ancillary rights such as consumer and home entertainment product offerings, and we pay license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation in connection with these acquired rights. We also license various music rights from the major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations, and some of these sources are highly consolidated.\nOur investments in original and acquired programming are significant and involve complex negotiations with numerous third parties, and rapid changes in consumer behavior have increased the risk associated with the success of all kinds of programming. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay for talent and intellectual property rights, which may result in significantly increased costs. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments in programming, films and other content when the content is broadcast or distributed.\nFurther, increased competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original programming, such as Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, increases our content costs as they introduce different ways of compensating talent and approaching production. In addition, as competition with these entrants for the creation and acquisition of quality programming continues to escalate, the complexity of negotiations over acquired rights to the content and the value of the rights we aim to acquire may increase, leading to increased acquisition costs, and our ability to successfully acquire content of the highest quality may face greater uncertainty.\nThe accounting for the expenses we incur in connection with our programming, films and other content requires that we make judgments about the potential success and useful life of the program or film. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, it may result in decreased profitability and the accelerated recognition of the expense and/or write-down of the value of the asset. We estimate the ultimate revenues of a film before it is released based on a number of factors, and we then update our estimate of ultimate revenues, including following a film\u2019s initial theatrical release, based on expected future and actual results. If we reduce our estimate of ultimate revenues, it may result in the accelerations of capitalized film cost amortization. Similarly, if we determine it is no longer advantageous for us to air a program on our media networks, we would accelerate our amortization of the program costs.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Loss of Key Talent Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of not only our corporate and divisional executive teams, but also the various creative talent and entertainment personalities with whom we work. For example, we employ or contract with several entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and we produce films with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other talent. These individuals are important to achieving the success of our programs, films and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain these individuals on current terms or if our entertainment personalities lose their current appeal or we fail to attract new talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPolitical and Economic Conditions in a Variety of Markets around the World Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur businesses operate and have customers, partners and audiences worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. For that reason, economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses, in particular revenues in both domestic and international markets derived from advertising sales, theatrical releases, home entertainment distribution, television licensing and sales of consumer products. Economic conditions in each market can also impact our audience\u2019s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. In addition, as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar (compared to, for example, the Argentinian peso, the British pound and the Euro, among others) has increased. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period.\nIn addition, our businesses are exposed to certain political and economic risks inherent in conducting a global business. These include, among others retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in other countries, including in the U.S.; potential for longer payment cycles; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nThe formal two-year process governing the UK\u2019s departure from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) began on March 29, 2017. Depending upon the ultimate terms of Brexit, the UK could lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The effects of the Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic and market conditions in the UK, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the Euro and the British Pound. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal and economic instability and uncertainty in the EU, including changes in the regulatory environment, which could impact our ability to use UK law under \u201ccountry of origin\u201d rules for programming in the EU, potential trade barriers between the UK and the EU and between the UK and other countries, and potential content production quota regulations. Given that a portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the UK, any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or Foreign Laws or Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur program services, filmed entertainment and online, mobile and app properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including relating to intellectual property, content regulation, user privacy, data protection, anti-corruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, export and market access restrictions, and exceptions and limitations on copyright and censorship, among others.\nLaws in some non-U.S. jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S., and the enforcement of such laws can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which could impact our ability to expand our operations and undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business.\nThe U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our businesses. Our Nickelodeon business in particular is subject to a number of regulations regarding children. For example, privacy regulations make it difficult to measure viewership by children. In addition, federal legislators and regulators have proposed voluntary guidelines on advertising to children in an effort to combat unhealthy eating and childhood obesity, and have considered imposing limitations on the marketing of certain movies and regulating product placement and other program sponsorship arrangements. The threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue.\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which has implications for how such data is managed. For example, GDPR expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the EU and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require us to change our business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of our business in a manner adverse to our business operations. Many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. Our failure to comply could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. or foreign governments, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in interpretations of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe Could Be Subject to Material Liabilities as a Result of Changes in Tax Laws, Regulations and Administrative Practices, Interpretations and Policies\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies in the federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate, and these rates may be subject to significant change. Our tax returns are routinely audited and litigation, adverse outcomes, or settlements may occur because tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for intercompany arrangements. Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, may expose us to tax risks as a result of the on-going issuance of interpretive guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies as to how provisions of the Act are to be applied which could be different from our current interpretations. Such changes, litigation, adverse outcomes, or audit settlements may result in the recognition of an additional charge to our income tax provision in the period and may adversely affect our effective income tax rate or cash payments and may therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nVolatility and Weakness in Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Our Credit Availability and Related Financing Costs\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. Although we can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. In addition, our access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by our short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in our debt ratings, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.\nOur Ongoing Investment in New Businesses, Products, Services and Technologies Through Acquisitions and Other Strategic Initiatives Present Many Risks, and We May Not Realize the Financial and Strategic Goals We Had Contemplated, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nWe have acquired and invested, and expect to continue to acquire and invest, in new businesses, products, services and technologies as part of our ongoing efforts to transition to next-generation platforms and solutions and diversify beyond our core business. Such acquisitions and strategic initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management attention from current operations; insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities\nassumed and expenses associated with the new investments; failure to achieve projected synergies, cost savings or cash flow from acquired businesses, which are based on projections that are inherently uncertain; unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities; difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies and systems of acquired businesses and, in the case of foreign acquisitions, integrating operations across different cultures and languages and addressing the particular currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses; and a failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology.\nBecause new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, no assurance can be given that such investments and other strategic alternatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe Could Be Adversely Affected by Strikes and Other Union Activity\nWe and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Some of our collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. In addition, any labor disputes may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms for a renewal, which could increase our costs.\nOur Revenues, Expenses and Operating Results May Vary Based on the Timing, Mix, Number and Availability of Our Films and Other Programming and on Seasonal Factors\nOur revenues, expenses and operating results fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our theatrical films, home entertainment releases and programs for licensing. For example, our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period relative to the corresponding period in the prior year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released and the timing of delivery of programming to television and digital distributors. Our operating results also fluctuate due to the timing of the recognition of marketing expenses, which are typically largely incurred prior to the release of films, with the recognition of related revenues in later periods.\nOur business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on audiences\u2019 viewing habits and attendance. Typically, our revenue from advertising is highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season, among other factors, and revenue from films is highest in the summer. The effects of these variances make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter.\nThrough National Amusements\u2019 Voting Control of Viacom and CBS, Certain Directors and Stockholders May Face Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest, and National Amusements is in a Position to Control Actions that Require, or May be Accomplished by, Stockholder Approval\nNational Amusements, directly and indirectly, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS. National Amusements owns shares in Viacom representing approximately 79.8% of the voting interest in Viacom and approximately 10% of Viacom\u2019s combined common stock. National Amusements is controlled by Sumner M. Redstone, our Chairman Emeritus, who is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Amusements, through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the \u201cSMR Trust\u201d), which owns shares in National Amusements representing 80% of the voting interest of National Amusements. The shares representing the other 20% of the voting interest of National Amusements are held through a trust controlled by Shari E. Redstone, who is Mr. Redstone\u2019s daughter, the non-executive Vice Chair of Viacom\u2019s Board of Directors, the non-executive Vice Chair of CBS\u2019s board of directors, and the President and a member of the Board of Directors of National Amusements. The shares of National Amusements held by the SMR Trust are voted solely by Mr. Redstone until such time as his incapacity or death. Upon Mr. Redstone\u2019s incapacity or death, Ms. Redstone will also become a trustee of the SMR Trust and the shares of National Amusements held by the SMR Trust will be voted by the trustees of the SMR Trust. The current trustees include Mr. Redstone and David R. Andelman, both of whom are also members of the Board of Directors of National Amusements. In addition, Mr. Redstone serves as Chairman Emeritus of CBS.\nThe National Amusements ownership structure and the common directors among National Amusements, Viacom and CBS could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the directors and controlling stockholder of the commonly controlled entities face decisions that could have different implications for each entity. For example, potential conflicts of interest, or the appearance thereof, could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and CBS, or when we and CBS enter into any commercial arrangements with each other, despite review by our directors not affiliated with CBS.\nIn addition, National Amusements\u2019 voting control of us allows it to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, stockholder-proposed amendments to our bylaws, and transactions involving a change in control. For so long as National Amusements retains voting control of us, our stockholders other than National Amusements will be unable to affect the outcome of any corporate actions. The interests of National Amusements may not be the same as the interests of our other stockholders, who must rely on our independent directors to represent their interests.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation Could Prevent Us from Benefiting from Corporate Opportunities that Might Otherwise Have Been Available to Us\nOur certificate of incorporation and the certificate of incorporation of CBS both contain provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both us and to CBS. Our certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of Viacom who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of CBS acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both Viacom and CBS, such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to Viacom or CBS or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties, and shall not be liable, to Viacom or its stockholders. In addition, Viacom\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that Viacom renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to CBS. These provisions create the possibility that CBS could have access to corporate opportunities from which Viacom could benefit in addition to, or instead of, CBS, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe, National Amusements and CBS, and our Respective Businesses, Are Attributable to Each Other for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities or Impose Additional Costs\nSo long as we, National Amusements and CBS are under common control, each company\u2019s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, may be attributable to the other companies for purposes of U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust rules and regulations, certain rules and regulations of the FCC, certain rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the U.S., among others. The businesses of each company may continue to be attributable to the other companies for FCC and other purposes even after the companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of any of these other companies may have the effect of limiting the activities or strategic business alternatives available to us, including limitations to which we contractually agreed in connection with our separation from CBS, or may impose additional costs on us.", "PERMNO": 91066, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "VIAB"}
