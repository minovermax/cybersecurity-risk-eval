RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company's common stock involves a high degree of risk. Careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that were filed and will be filed with the SEC, in evaluating the Company and its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to or that are currently seen as immaterial may also harm Company's business. If any of these risks occur, business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of the Company's common stock could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\n\u2022The Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with limited operating history and significant losses and negative cash flow, which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate its current business and predict its future success and viability.\n\u2022The Company's business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of its product candidates, and is highly dependent on success of its main lead candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\u2022The Company's lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is based on API that is already on the market, which exposes the Company to additional risks. In addition, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray uses a novel and unproven therapeutic approach and mechanism of action, and therefore its efficacy and safety are difficult to predict, and there is no guarantee that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or any other product candidates will be approved by the FDA.\n\u2022Drug development is a highly uncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk; in addition, clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes. The outcome of preclinical testing and earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim, topline and preliminary data from clinical trials may change as more data becomes available.\n\u2022If the Company experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, its receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented, the Company may be unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, and therefore be unable to commercialize its product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\n\u2022The Company's business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.\n\u2022If the Company engages in acquisitions, in-licensing or strategic partnerships, this may increase its capital requirements, dilute stockholders, cause it to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject the Company to other risks.\n\u2022The Company is subject to government regulation and contractual obligations related to privacy, security, and data protection, and its actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm its business. Additionally, cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could compromise the Company\u2019s computer systems and data, or those of its third party partners, contractors or consultants, could expose the Company to liability, affect its reputation and otherwise harm the business.\n\u2022Changes in U.S. tax law may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022The commercial success of the Company's products is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial scale, marketing the Company's product candidates internationally and the availability and sufficiency of third party payor coverage and reimbursement.\n\u2022Even if the Company obtains regulatory approval for any of its product candidates, it may be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations or post-marketing commitments as specified by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in additional costs associated with those commitments.\n\u2022The Company faces significant competition, and the Company's product candidates may, if approved, compete with existing branded, generic and off-label products.\n\u2022The Company is subject to risks of litigation, including securities litigation. Further, if product liability lawsuits are brought against the Company, it may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of its products.\n\u2022If the Company is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for its technology and products for any reason, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained in any market is not sufficiently broad, the Company may not be able to compete effectively in its markets.\n\u2022Third party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate the Company's patents or other proprietary rights, may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates.\n\u2022The Company may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents, the patents of any licensors or its other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive or even cost-prohibitive, time consuming, and unsuccessful given the uncertainty of litigation.\n\u2022The Company's future reliance on third parties may require the Company to share its trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that the Company's trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\n\u2022The Company may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.\n\u2022Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to its competitive advantage.\n\u2022If the Company's future trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then it may not be able to build name recognition in markets of interest and its business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022If the Company fails to comply with its obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, such agreements may be terminated, the Company may be required to pay damages and it could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting its product candidates; in addition, collaboration or partnership arrangements that the Company may enter into in the future may not be successful.\n\u2022If the FDA does not conclude that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray satisfies the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA), or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as the Company expects, the approval pathway for those product candidates may take longer, cost more or entail greater complications and risks than anticipated, and may not be successful.\n\u2022The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If the Company is ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, it will be unable to generate product revenue and its business will be substantially harmed.\n\u2022The Company's employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\n\u2022If the Company fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, it could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on its business.\n\u2022Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of the Company's product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that the Company will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of its product candidates in other jurisdictions.\n\u2022The Company's business activities are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which it operates, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations.\n\u2022Disruptions at the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner.\n\u2022The Company relies on third parties to conduct its clinical trials and for the production of its product candidates. Failure of those third parties to perform satisfactorily or to produce sufficient quantities of its product candidate, could delay, prevent or impair the completion of such trials or the development or commercialization of such product.\n\u2022If the Company decides to pursue collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of its product candidates, but is not able to establish collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, it may have to alter its development and commercialization plans. If it does enter into collaborations that are not successful, it may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\n\u2022The Company's business operations and current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, consultants, patient organizations, customers, CROs and third party payors in connection with its current and future business activities may be subject to various federal and state healthcare, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose the Company to various sanctions, penalties, contractual damages or diminished profits and future earnings.\n\u2022The Company will need substantial additional funding in the future. If it is unable to raise capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, it may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs or its future commercialization efforts.\n\u2022A number of internal and external factors could impact the stock price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s stock, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\n\u2022The Company has been incurring increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. Additionally, if the Company fails to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, its ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\n\u2022The Company disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nThe Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with limited operating history. It has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its formation and will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Company has no products approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate its current business and predict its future success and viability.\nThe Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Operations to date have been limited to organizing the Company, raising capital and developing product candidates. In addition, as a new business, the Company may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. The Company will need to transition from a company with a clinical development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. It has not yet demonstrated its ability to successfully obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on its behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization, and may not be successful in such a transition.\nThe Company does not have any products approved for sale, has not generated any revenue and has incurred net losses in each reporting period since its formation. The Company has funded its operations primarily from the sale and issuance of its securities. Additionally, the net losses the Company incurs may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter such that a period-to-period comparison of its results of operations may not be a good indicator of the Company's future performance. The size of the Company future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of its expenses and its ability to generate revenue.\nThe Company expects to continue incurring significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its expenses will increase substantially if and as it:\n\u2022initiates additional preclinical, clinical and other studies for its product candidates or expands or modifies existing studies or currently planned studies;\n\u2022changes or adds additional manufacturers or suppliers, some of which may require additional permits or other governmental approvals;\n\u2022creates additional infrastructure to support its operations as a public company and its product development and planned future commercialization efforts;\n\u2022seeks marketing approvals and reimbursement for its product candidates;\n\u2022establishes a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which it may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022seeks to identify and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022acquires or in-licenses other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022makes milestone or other payments in connection with the development or approval of its product candidates;\n\u2022maintains, protects, and expands its intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022experiences any delays or encounters issues with any of the above.\nThe Company's prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on working capital and ability to achieve and maintain profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the success of its lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. If it is unable to successfully obtain the marketing approvals necessary to commercialize OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or experiences significant delays in doing so, or if after obtaining marketing approvals, the Company fails to successfully commercialize this product candidate, its business will be materially harmed.\nThe Company has devoted a significant portion of its financial resources and business efforts to the development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. Although it is also developing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for other indications and is exploring other potential products, the Company does not anticipate receiving marketing approvals for any product candidates other than OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in the next several years. The Company's ability to generate revenues from product sales will depend on its obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray , and it cannot accurately predict when or if OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray will receive marketing approval for dry eye disease or a secondary indication. Because the Company has focused its resources and efforts on developing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for dry eye disease, it has limited resources and may fail to commit adequate resources to, or delay the pursuit of opportunities for, other indications or other product candidates that may have commercial potential, and its resource allocation decisions may cause the Company to fail to capitalize on viable product candidates and profitable market opportunities. If the Company fails to successfully develop OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for dry eye disease, it may not be able to identify, assess and develop OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for other indications or other product candidates on a timely basis, which could materially affect Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company's business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other future product candidates. It currently generates no revenues from sales of any products and may never generate revenue or be profitable.\nThe Company has no products approved for commercial sale and does not anticipate generating any revenue until either OC-01(varenicline) nasal spray or another product candidate receives the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary for commercialization. Even though the Company has submitted an NDA for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, it cannot be certain that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray will receive regulatory approval, or be successfully commercialized even if the Company receives regulatory approval. The Company's ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on its ability, or any future collaborator\u2019s ability, to achieve a number of objectives, including:\n\u2022successful and timely completion of preclinical and clinical development of its product candidates, including OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other future product candidates;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining relationships with key scientists, CROs and clinical sites for the clinical development, both in the United States and internationally, of its product candidates, including OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other future product candidates;\n\u2022timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates for which the Company successfully completes clinical development;\n\u2022complying with any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support clinical development and meet the market demand for product candidates that the Company develops, if approved;\n\u2022successful commercial launch following any marketing approval, including the development of a commercial infrastructure, whether in-house or with one or more collaborators;\n\u2022a continued acceptable safety profile both prior to and following any marketing approval of its product candidates;\n\u2022commercial acceptance of the Company's product candidates by patients, the medical community and third party payors;\n\u2022identifying, assessing and developing new product candidates;\n\u2022protecting Company's rights in its intellectual property portfolio, including, obtaining, maintaining and expanding patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, and;\n\u2022defending against third party interference or infringement claims, if any;\n\u2022obtaining favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or desirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize its existing or acquired product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by government and third party payors for product candidates that the Company develops;\n\u2022addressing any competing therapies and technological and market developments; and\n\u2022attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nThe Company may never be successful in achieving its objectives and, even if it does, may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability, or comparable to the revenues of existing therapies, including Restasis\u00ae and Xiidra\u00ae. If it does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company's failure to become and remain profitable would decrease its value and could impair its ability to maintain or further its research and development efforts, raise necessary additional capital, grow business, retain key employees and continue its operations.\nThe Company's lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is based on an API that is already on the market, which exposes the Company to additional risks.\nThe API in OC-01, varenicline (in the form of varenicline tartrate), has been previously approved by the FDA and the EMA as an oral tablet under the trade name Chantix \u00ae, indicated as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and is available in more than 80 countries throughout the world. From 2009 to 2016, the FDA required Chantix\u00ae to carry a boxed warning advising consumers of potential serious mental health side effects from Chantix. Although the FDA removed this box warning from Chantix in 2016 in response to the EAGLES study sponsored by Pfizer, regulatory authorities may identify other adverse side effects related to varenicline in the future or may add back the warning. Additionally, the Company anticipates that manufacturers will begin selling varenicline in generic form in the future, which could lead to increased use of varenicline by patients and increase the possibility that patients experience adverse side effects related to varenicline. Any adverse side effects that arise from the use of any form of varenicline, whether Chantix, generic varenicline or the Company product candidate, or reporting thereof could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and seriously harm Company's business. Furthermore, if manufacturer demand for varenicline increases in the future, particularly as a result of generic forms of varenicline becoming available, the Company may not be able to continue to obtain varenicline on commercially reasonable terms, which would seriously harm Company's business.\nOC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray uses a novel and unproven therapeutic approach and mechanism of action to treat dry eye disease and there is no guarantee that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or any other product candidates will be approved by the FDA.\nThe Company is developing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray as a preservative-free, aqueous nasal spray that will stimulate the lacrimal functional unit (LFU) to produce natural tear film. To the Company\u2019s knowledge, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray represents the first pharmacological treatment approach for dry eye disease that is aimed at stimulating the LFU. Other than with respect to data from the studies and trials of OC-01 and OC-02, there is limited or no clinical evidence showing that natural tear film can be produced through the stimulation of the LFU. Moreover, even though preclinical studies and clinical trials of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray have supported the submission of a 505(b)(2) NDA for the treatment of dry eye disease, the Company may not succeed in demonstrating safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for other indications, including NK, which is the disease being studied in OLYMPIA, the Company\u2019s upcoming Phase 2 clinical trial. Advancing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray as a novel product creates significant challenges for the Company, including:\n\u2022obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022educating medical personnel, including ECPs, and patients regarding the potential efficacy and safety benefits, as well as the challenges, of incorporating the Company\u2019s product candidates, if approved, into treatment regimens; and\n\u2022establishing the necessary sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any marketing approvals to gain market acceptance.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or any of its other future product candidates will be approved by the FDA. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials often fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities despite having successfully progressed through preclinical studies and other clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants.\nFor example, although OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray met the primary endpoint in ONSET-2 in both the 1.2 mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml dose groups, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray did not meet the secondary endpoint for patient-reported symptoms of eye dryness in a Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE\u00ae) and other secondary endpoints in either dose group. Following completion of ONSET-2, the Company conducted additional analyses on a post-hoc basis of the data from its ONSET-2 study to support its NDA submission. The Company may also conduct additional post-hoc analyses on the results of clinical trials in the future. Post-hoc analyses performed after unmasking trial results can result in the introduction of bias, may not be predictive of success in any future clinical trials and are given less weight by regulatory authorities than pre-specified analyses. Additionally, the Company cannot guarantee that the safety profile of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in healthy volunteers and patients with dry eye disease will be replicated in trials and studies for other indications, such as NK. Assessments of efficacy can vary widely for a particular participant, and from participant to participant and site to site within a clinical trial. This subjectivity can increase the uncertainty of, and adversely impact, the Company\u2019s clinical trial outcomes. In addition, participants treated with OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray may also be treated with other investigational drugs, prescription drugs or even over-the-counter treatments following the treatment period of the Company\u2019s OC-01 studies, any of which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to the Company\u2019s product candidate, but which are observed during the long-term safety follow-up for OC-01. The occurrence of such side effects or adverse events could have a negative impact on OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray\u2019s safety profile.\nThe Company may experience delays with respect to FDA\u2019s review of the OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray NDA as the pandemic-related workload at the agency may require diversion of personnel away from review of products that are not used to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 and travel restrictions may delay or prevent the inspection of clinical sites or manufacturing operations that are necessary to support approval decisions.\nDrug development is a highly uncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. The outcome of preclinical testing and earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. The results of the Company's clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and the Company may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidate.\nResearch and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky. The Company cannot give any assurance that any of its product candidates will receive regulatory, including marketing, approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of the Company's product candidates, the Company must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that its product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety, efficacy and durability profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical\ntrials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical and clinical studies of the Company's product candidates may not be predictive of the results of early-stage or later-stage clinical trials, and results of early clinical trials of the Company's product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. The results of clinical trials in one set of subjects may not be predictive of those obtained in another. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety, efficacy or durability results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants.\nThe Company may also experience issues in implementing its clinical trials that would delay or prevent it from satisfying the applicable requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including:\n\u2022the number of participants required for clinical trials of its product candidates may be larger than it anticipates, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than the Company anticipates or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than the Company anticipates;\n\u2022the Company's third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their obligations to the Company in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022other regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize the Company or its investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; and\n\u2022the Company may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites.\nThe Company may be unable to design and execute clinical trials that support marketing approval. It cannot be certain that any of its future clinical trials will be successful. For example, use of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray requires the patient to follow a prescribed technique to administer the nasal spray. Failure to properly administer the nasal spray by the patient or inappropriate technique demonstration by the ECP, may adversely affect the outcome of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in demonstrating efficacy in future clinical trials, such as the OLYMPIA trial in NK. Additionally, any safety concerns observed in any one of the Company's clinical trials in its targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of its product candidates in NK and potentially other indications, which could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, even if such clinical trials are successfully completed, the Company cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as the Company does, and more trials could be required before it submits its product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, the Company may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to it, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of its product candidates. Even if regulatory approval is secured for any of the Company's product candidates, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of its product candidate, which may also limit its commercial potential.\nIf the Company experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, its receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nThe Company may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for its product candidates if it is unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of subjects to participate in these trials to such trial\u2019s conclusion as required by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials. Any difficulties the Company experiences relating to the initiation or completion of patient visits in clinical trials, including as impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, could delay regulatory approval for its product candidates.\nPatient enrollment may be affected if the Company\u2019s competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that are under development for the same indications as its product candidates, and subjects who would otherwise be eligible for clinical trials instead enroll in clinical trials of the Company\u2019s competitors\u2019 product candidates. Patient enrollment for any of the Company\u2019s future clinical trials may be affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022availability and efficacy of approved drugs for the disease under investigation;\n\u2022participant eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol;\n\u2022ECPs' and participants' perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study in relation to\nother available therapies, including any new products that may be approved for the indications the Company is\ninvestigating;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022participant referral practices of ECPs;\n\u2022the ability to monitor participants adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective trial subjects;\n\u2022continued enrollment of prospective subjects by clinical trial sites;\n\u2022the risk that subjects enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u2022disruptions or difficulties, or other restrictions, in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing trials due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for its clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require it to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in the Company\u2019s clinical trials may result in increased development costs for its product candidates and jeopardize its ability to obtain marketing approval for the sale of its product candidates. Furthermore, even if the Company is able to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for its clinical trials, the Company may have difficulty maintaining enrollment of such subjects in its clinical trials.\nThe Company may also face challenges in collecting data from follow up visits related to its enrolled clinical trials. For example, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak, select clinical trial sites in the Company\u2019s ONSET-2 clinical trial were closed and subjects were unable to attend visits per the trial protocol, which reduced the amount of data the Company was able to collect for subjects at these affected centers with respect to primary and secondary endpoints. The Company believes that this inability to collect data had an adverse impact on the statistical powering of certain of its secondary endpoints in ONSET-2 and may impact its future clinical trial results.\nThe Company's current or future product candidates may cause or reveal significant adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval. In addition, if the Company obtains approval for any of its product candidates, significant adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects may be identified during post-marketing surveillance, which could result in regulatory action or negatively affect Company's ability to market the product.\nAdverse events or other undesirable side effects caused by or associated with treatment by the Company's product candidates could cause it or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, subjects report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. It is possible that as the Company tests its product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were not observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to subjects on a commercial scale after approval.\nThe most commonly reported adverse events in ONSET-2, ONSET-1, ZEN and MYSTIC were non-ocular in nature, which were sneezing and coughing. If approved, the Company expects that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray will be used chronically over a prolonged period of time. However, the Company has no clinical safety data on patients treated with OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for longer than 84 days and these adverse events are subjective and based on subjects' self-report, which may not accurately reflect the actual number of adverse events. The Company's understanding of the relationship between its product candidates and these adverse events may change as it gathers more information, and additional unexpected adverse events may occur. If additional clinical experience indicates that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or any other product candidate has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, participant recruitment for studies and the ability of enrolled subjects to complete studies could be negatively impacted, and the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, which would severely harm the Company's business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, if one or more of the Company's product candidates receives marketing approval, and it or others later identify undesirable side effects or adverse events caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product or require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022it may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials or post-approval studies;\n\u2022it may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, including ECPs, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022it could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022its reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent the Company from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from the Company's clinical trials that it announces or publishes from time to time may change as more patient data become available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, the Company may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from its clinical trials. These interim updates are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. The Company also makes assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of its analyses of data, and it may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that the Company reports may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data the Company previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the Company may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than all endpoints. Interim data from clinical trials that the Company may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse changes between interim data and final data could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, additional disclosure of interim data by the Company or by its competitors in the future could result in volatility in the price of the Company common stock. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with the Company assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate and the Company in general. In addition, the information the Company chooses to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is typically selected from a more extensive amount of available information. Investors may not agree with what it determines is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in its disclosure, and any information it determines not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or the Company's business. If the preliminary or topline data that the Company reports differ from late, final or actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, its ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize the Company product candidates may be harmed, which could materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company's success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers and employees.\nTo succeed, the Company must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified executives as it builds out the management team, and the Company faces significant competition for experienced personnel. The Company is highly dependent on the principal members of its management and needs to continue to add executives with operational and commercialization experience as it plans for commercialization of its product candidates and builds out a leadership team that can manage its operations as a public company. If the Company does not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect its ability to execute the Company's business plan and harm its operating results. In particular, the loss of one or more of its executive officers could be detrimental if no suitable replacement is recruited in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense and as a result, the Company may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the future success of its business. The Company could in the future have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in its employee recruitment and retention efforts.\nMany of the other biotechnology companies that the Company competes against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better prospects for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what the Company has to offer. If the Company is unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel,\nthe rate and success at which it can discover, develop and commercialize its product candidates will be limited and the potential for successfully growing its business will be harmed.\nIf the Company engages in acquisitions, in-licensing or strategic partnerships, this may increase its capital requirements, dilute stockholders, cause it to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject the Company to other risks.\nThe Company may engage in various acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies or businesses. Any acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022the assumption of indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022the issuance of equity securities which would result in dilution to the Company's stockholders;\n\u2022assimilation of operations, intellectual property, products and product candidates of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the Company's existing product candidates and initiatives in pursuing such an acquisition or strategic partnership;\n\u2022retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in its ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u2022risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022the Company's inability to generate revenue from acquired intellectual property, technology and/or products sufficient to meet its objectives or even to offset the associated transaction and maintenance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems, or those used by the Company\u2019s third party research institution collaborators, CROs, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer other breakdowns, cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could compromise such systems and data, expose the Company to liability, affect its reputation and otherwise harm its business.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate its business, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. The Company also relies on third party vendors and their information technology systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and those of its CROs, third-party vendors, contractors and consultants may be vulnerable to compromise from traditional computer hackers; malicious code (such as computer viruses or worms); employee error, theft or misuse; denial-of-service attacks; cyber-attacks by sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors; or other system disruptions. There can be no assurance that the Company, its collaborators, CROs, third-party vendors, contractors and consultants will be successful in efforts to detect, prevent, protect against or fully recover systems or data from all break-downs, service interruptions, attacks or breaches of systems.\nAs the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks will grow in frequency, sophistication and intensity and will become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-threats may be generic, or they may be targeted against the Company\u2019s information systems. The Company and its third-party vendors may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against all such security threats. As a result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the Company may face increased cybersecurity risks due to its reliance on internet technology and the number of its employees that are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.\nThe costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any identified security vulnerabilities could be significant, the Company\u2019s efforts to address these issues may not be successful, and these issues could result in interruptions, delays, negative publicity, loss of customer trust, diminished purchase or use of our products, and other harms to the Company\u2019s business and competitive position. Remediation of any potential security breach may involve significant time, resources, and expenses. Any security breach may result in regulatory inquiries, litigation or other investigations, and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial and operational condition. The Company could be required to fundamentally change its business activities and practices in response to a security breach and our systems or networks may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation.\nIf a breakdown, cyber-attack or other information security breach were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of the Company\u2019s development programs and business operations, whether due to a loss of trade secrets or other proprietary information. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or future clinical trials could result in delays in the Company\u2019s regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, the Company relies on its third-party research institution collaborators for research and development of its product candidates and\nother third parties for the manufacture of its product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their information systems could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company receives, generates and stores significant and increasing volumes of sensitive, confidential and/or proprietary information, including personal data (such as health information), research and development information, and commercial information (such as business and financial information). While the Company has security measures in place that are designed to protect such information and prevent security breaches, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s security measures or those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers that store or otherwise process the Company\u2019s information on our behalf will be effective.\nThe Company is required to comply with laws, rules, regulations and other obligations that require it to maintain the security of personal information. It may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities, and others of security breaches involving personal information. For example. in the United States, notice of breaches of protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA) may need to be disclosed to affected individuals, the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and others.\nA security breach may cause the Company to breach its contracts. The Company's agreements with relevant stakeholders such as collaborators may require the Company to use legally required, industry-standard or reasonable measures to safeguard personal information. A security breach could lead to claims by relevant stakeholders that the Company has failed to comply with such contractual obligations. In addition, any non-compliance with the Company\u2019s data privacy obligations in its contracts or the Company\u2019s inability to flow down such obligations from relevant stakeholders to the Company\u2019s vendors may cause the Company to breach its contracts. As a result, the Company could be subject to legal action or the relevant stakeholders could end their relationships with it. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in the Company\u2019s contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages.\nThe Company does not maintain standalone cyber-security insurance and has limited insurance coverage in the event of any breach or disruption of its or its collaborators\u2019, CROs\u2019, or vendors\u2019 systems, including any unauthorized access or loss of any personal data that the Company may collect, store or otherwise process. The costs related to significant security breaches, disruptions or data breaches could be material and exceed the limits of any insurance coverage the Company may have. In addition, the Company cannot be sure that its existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that its insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. To the extent any disruption, data breach or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, the Company\u2019s data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, the Company could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of its product candidates could be delayed and its business and operations could be adversely affected and/or could result in the loss or disclosure of critical or sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the Company.\nThe Company is subject to stringent and evolving laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, and policies related to data privacy and security, and its actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security, including the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal data. Data privacy has become a significant issue in the United States, countries in the European Union, or EU, and in many other countries in which it may operate. The regulatory frameworks for privacy issues are evolving and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions, including monetary penalties and personal data processing penalties that could require us to change our business practices. Interpretation of these frameworks is likely to remain uncertain and potentially inconsistent for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our collaborators\u2019, service providers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use or share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. Despite the Company's efforts to bring practices into compliance with these obligations, it may not be successful in its efforts to achieve compliance either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Noncompliance could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental and regulatory entities, collaborators, data subjects or others.\nIn the U.S., these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and the following laws and regulations: the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, and other state and federal laws relating to data privacy and security. For example, the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered businesses to provide disclosures to California residents and afford such individuals data protection rights, including the ability to opt-out of the sale of personal information. The CCPA provides a private right of action and statutory damages for violations, including for data breaches. Although the CCPA exempts certain data regarding clinical trials,\nthe CCPA, to the extent applicable to the Company\u2019s business and operations, may increase the Company\u2019s compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information the Company maintains about California residents. In addition, California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, that goes into effect on January 1, 2023. It is expected that the CPRA would, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit the use of their sensitive information, provide for penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law. These laws reflect our Company\u2019s vulnerability to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal information.\nInternationally, the Company\u2019s operations may be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from foreign data protection authorities. The Company\u2019s clinical trial programs and research collaborations outside the United States may implicate foreign data protection laws, including in Europe. Many jurisdictions have established, or are in the process of establishing, privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, the Company\u2019s collaborators, service providers, including the Company\u2019s CROs, and contractors must comply. For example, European data protection laws, including, without limitation, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, impose stringent data protection requirements for processing the personally identifiable information of individuals residing in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. For example, these laws impose robust disclosure requirements to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, strict timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data, such as health data, and additional obligations when the Company contracts with third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR increases the Company\u2019s obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EU by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial participants and investigators. The GDPR provides for fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues, whichever is greater. In addition, the GDPR authorizes penalties for non-compliance and civil litigation claims.\nThe GDPR applies extraterritorially, and the Company may be subject to the GDPR because of its data processing activities that involve the personal data of individuals located in the European Union, such as in connection with any European Union clinical trials. GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to the personal data that the Company processes, and it may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and may interrupt or delay the Company\u2019s development activities, and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (collectively, Europe) to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. One of the primary safeguards used for transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States, namely, the Privacy Shield administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, was invalidated by a decision of Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Subsequently, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner also opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is inadequate for transfers of data from Switzerland to the U.S. The CJEU also cast doubt on our ability to use one of the primary alternatives to the Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, to transfer lawfully personal data from Europe to the United States and most other countries. Further, the European Commission recently proposed updates to the Standard Contractual Clauses. At present, there are few if any viable alternatives to the Standard Contractual Clauses and, therefore, there is uncertainty regarding how to ensure that transfers of personal information from Europe to the U.S. and other countries comply with European data protection laws. As such, any transfers by the Company, or the Company\u2019s third party vendors, of personal data from Europe may not comply with European data protection laws; may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to the GDPR\u2019s heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions, and may restrict our clinical trial activities in Europe, limit our ability to collaborate with CROs, service providers and other companies subject to European data protection laws. Loss of the Company\u2019s ability to transfer personal data from Europe may also require us to increase the Company\u2019s data processing capabilities in those jurisdictions at significant expense.\nFurther, the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. Following December 31, 2020, the GDPR\u2019s data protection obligations continue to apply to the United Kingdom in substantially unvaried form under the so called \u201cUK GDPR\u201d or more explicitly, the GDPR continues to form part of the laws in the United Kingdom by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (including by the various Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (EU Exit) Regulations), which potentially exposes us to two parallel data protection regimes, each of which authorizes fines and the potential for divergent enforcement actions. In addition, it is still unclear whether the transfer of personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom will in the future continue to remain lawful under the GDPR. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU, the European Commission will continue to treat the United Kingdom as if it remained a member state of the EU in relation to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom, meaning such transfers may be made without a need for additional safeguards, for four months from January 1, 2021, with a potential additional two month extension. This\n\u201ctransition\u201d period, however, will end if and when the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of the United Kingdom or the United Kingdom amends certain UK data protection laws, or relevant aspects thereof, without the EU\u2019s consent (unless those amendments are made simply to align those UK data protection laws with the EU\u2019s data protection regime). If the European Commission does not adopt an adequacy decision with regard to personal data transfers to the United Kingdom before the expiration of the transition period, from that point onwards, the United Kingdom will be a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR and such transfers will need to be made subject to GDPR-compliant safeguards (for example, the Standard Contractual Clauses).\nAdditionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, and strict requirements and limitations for processing personal information, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil enacted the General Data Protection Law, New Zealand enacted the New Zealand Privacy Act, China released its draft Personal Information Protection Law, and Canada introduced the Digital Charter Implementation Act. As with the GDPR, these laws are broad and may increase our compliance burdens, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how the Company collects, uses, discloses, retains, and processes personal information about them.\nThe Company publishes privacy policies and other documentation regarding the Company\u2019s collection, processing, use and disclosure of personal information. Although the Company endeavors to comply with the Company\u2019s published policies and other documentation, the Company may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company may not be successful in achieving compliance if the Company\u2019s employees or third-party vendors fail to comply with the Company\u2019s published policies and documentation. Such failures can subject the Company to potential foreign, local, state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of the Company\u2019s actual practices. Moreover, subjects about whom the Company or the Company\u2019s partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit the Company\u2019s ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that the Company has violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws or applicable privacy notices even if the Company is not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in U.S. tax law may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic crisis. The CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package that includes numerous U.S. federal income tax provisions, including the modification of: (i) net operating loss rules, (ii) the alternative minimum tax refund and (iii) business interest deduction limitations under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). ). On Dec. 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (H.R. 133), an appropriations and stimulus package that includes many U.S. federal income tax provisions generally favorable to taxpayers such as (i) retroactive changes to and extensions of items contained in The CARES Act, and (ii) extensions of dozens of expiring tax provisions including the employer tax credit for paid family and medical leave.\nThe Tax Act also significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The Tax Act remains unclear in many respects and has been, and may continue to be, the subject of amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), which have lessened or increased certain adverse impacts of the Tax Act and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. The Company continues to work with its tax advisors to determine the full impact the Tax Act, the CARES Act, and H.R. 133 will have. The Company's investors should consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to both the Tax Act and the CARES Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in the Company's common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nThe Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and certain other tax attributes could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under U.S. tax law. The Company\u2019s NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 taxable years under applicable U.S. federal tax law. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a U.S. federal NOL carryforward balance of $120.6 million, $4.5 million of which will expire beginning in the year 2035, if unutilized, and $116.1 million of which will carry forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a state NOL carryforward balance of $123.9 million, which will expire beginning in the year 2035, if unutilized.\nUnder the Tax Act, federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. Under the CARES Act, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of such loss. Due to the Company\u2019s cumulative losses through December 31, 2020, it does not anticipate that such provision of the CARES Act will be relevant to it. The deductibility of federal NOLs, particularly for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, may be limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s NOLs and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the IRS and state tax authorities. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a cumulative change in the Company\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The Company determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to prior ownership changes. The Company may, however, experience ownership changes in the future as a result of equity offerings or subsequent shifts in its stock ownership, some of which are outside its control. If the Company\u2019s ability to utilize those NOLs and tax credit carryforwards becomes limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d as described above, it may not be able to utilize a material portion of its NOLs and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on its cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of the Company\u2019s Product Candidates\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results. If clinical trials of the Company\u2019s product candidates, particularly OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, are prolonged or delayed, the Company may be unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, and therefore be unable to commercialize its product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of its product candidates, the Company must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. To date, the Company has focused substantially all of its efforts and financial resources on identifying, acquiring, and developing its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and the Company cannot be certain that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. The Company\u2019s inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to it and negatively impact its ability to generate revenue. The Company\u2019s future success is dependent on its ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize product candidates. The Company currently does not generate any revenues from sales of any products, and it may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nEach of the Company\u2019s product candidates may require additional clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, achieving and maintaining commercial-scale supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before the Company generates any revenues from product sales. The Company is not permitted to market or promote any of its product candidates before it receives regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and it may never receive such regulatory approval for any of its product candidates. The Company may experience delays in its ongoing clinical trials and it does not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nThe Company may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent its ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and any other product candidates that it may develop, including:\n\u2022the Company may experience delays in or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites\n\u2022the Company may fail to obtain sufficient enrollment in its clinical trials or participants may fail to complete its clinical trials;\n\u2022clinical trials of its product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and it may decide, or regulators may require the Company, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022the Company may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require it, to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require the Company to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or it may be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval;\n\u2022regulators may revise the requirements for approving its product candidates, or such requirements may not be as it anticipates;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of its product candidates may be greater than it anticipates, and the Company may need to delay or suspend one or more trials until it completes additional financing transactions or otherwise receive adequate funding;\n\u2022the supply or quality of its product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of its product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate or may be delayed;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing it or its investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate trials;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u2022the Company may experience delays due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, including with respect to the receipt of product candidates or other materials, submission of NDAs, filing of Investigational New Drug Application, or INDs and starting any clinical trials for other indications or programs;\n\u2022the Company may experience delays with respect to FDA\u2019s review of the OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray NDA as the pandemic-related workload\nat the agency may require diversion of personnel away from review of non-pandemic products and travel restrictions may delay or prevent the inspection of clinical sites or manufacturing operations that are necessary to support approval\ndecisions; and\n\u2022the Company may experience manufacturing delays due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic in its supply chain caused by a shortage of raw materials, a lack of employees on site at its suppliers due to illness, or a lack of productivity at its suppliers due to local or national government quarantine restrictions on coming to the workplace.\nFor example, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the Company experienced an impact at select clinical trial sites during the month of March 2020 where ophthalmology practices were closed or subjects were unable to attend visits or where clinical trial sites did not feel comfortable putting their staff or subjects into a CAE\u00ae, which limited the Company\u2019s ability to assess the related secondary endpoint in its ONSET-2 study for those subjects. The Company does not know whether any of its preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. If the Company experiences delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of its product candidates, or is unable to achieve clinical endpoints due to unforeseen events, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the commercial prospects of its product candidates will be harmed, and its ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing its clinical trials will increase the Company\u2019s costs, slow down its product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize its ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Significant clinical trial delays could also allow the Company\u2019s competitors to bring products to market before it does or shorten any periods during which the Company has the exclusive right to commercialize its product candidates and impair its ability to commercialize its product candidates and may harm its business and results of operations.\nOC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and the Company's other product candidates have never been manufactured on a commercial scale, and there are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial scale.\nTo date, the Company's third party manufacturer has only manufactured OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in limited quantities in batch sizes appropriate for the Company's clinical trials and registration batches to support the NDA submission, for which batch sizes are a fraction of the size the Company expects will be necessary for commercialization. The manufacturing processes for commercial scale are still being developed and have not been tested and the process validation requirement has not yet been satisfied. Although the Company plans to manufacture commercial scale batches of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray on the same manufacturing line as the registration batches, with the same equipment, only at higher scale, there are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial volumes including, among others, cost overruns, technical or other problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. There is no assurance that the Company's manufacturer will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process for\nOC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray that achieves its objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost of goods, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, there is no assurance that the Company manufacturers will be able to manufacture OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or to meet potential future demand. If the manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of approved products for commercialization, either on a timely basis or at all, and in a cost-effective manner, the Company's commercialization efforts would be impaired, including impacting the launch of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or inventory levels, which could materially affect Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe commercial success of the Company's products depends on the availability and sufficiency of third party payor coverage and reimbursement.\nPatients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of the Company's products is dependent on the extent to which third party coverage and reimbursement is available from third party payors, including government health administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which the Company may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage decisions may not favor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available. Even if the Company obtains coverage for a given product, the associated reimbursement rate may not be adequate to cover its costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses, or may require copayments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use the Company's products unless reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of its products.\nCoverage and reimbursement policies for products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products among third party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and costly which will require the Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\nIn addition, the Company expects that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which the Company receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nIf the Company is unable to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage and adequate reimbursement for its products, the commercial success of these products may be greatly hindered and the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company's business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.\nThe Company's business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where it has concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third party contractors upon which it relies. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The pandemic and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and production have been suspended and demand for certain goods and services has fallen.\nThe President of the United States declared the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response and powers under the Defense Production Act, the legislation that facilitates the production of goods and services necessary for national security and for other purposes. In addition, in response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, many state, local and foreign governments have put in place, and others in the future may put in place, quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such orders or restrictions, and the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects that could negatively impact productivity and disrupt the Company's business and operations. For example, the Company's headquarters and certain of its trial sites are located in New Jersey, and in March 2020, the Governor of New Jersey announced that all businesses, excluding essential services, must decrease their in-office workforce by 100%. While some of these governmental restrictions have been lifted, the timing and extent to which\nsuch orders and restrictions will be removed remains uncertain. The Company has implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees, and it continues evaluating the situation as more information about the virus becomes available. Moreover, the Company's clinical development timelines and plans could be affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment could be delayed or suspended due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. In addition, some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and the ability to conduct follow up visits with treated patients may be limited if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. For example, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, select clinical trial sites in ONSET-2 clinical trial were closed and subjects were unable to attend visits per the trial protocol, which reduced the number of patients for which the Company collected data on with respect to its primary and secondary endpoints. In addition, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, a number of clinical trial sites for ONSET-2 did not feel comfortable putting their staff or subjects into the required CAE\u00ae, which limited the Company's ability to assess the related secondary endpoint for those subjects, which might have contributed to not achieving certain secondary endpoints in ONSET-2. The Company cannot assure that the inability to collect such data would not also have an adverse impact on its future clinical trial results. Similarly, the Company's ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic could be adversely impacted.\nThe continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic could severely impact the Company's business, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate planned clinical trials;\n\u2022delays or difficulties in enrolling and retaining patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct clinical trials, including interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022changes in local regulations as part of a response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic which may require the Company to change ways in which clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u2022risk that patient recruitment in the Company\u2019s clinical trials will be impacted due to pandemic-related lockdowns or stay-at-home advisories;\n\u2022risk that participants enrolled in the Company's clinical trials will acquire SARS-CoV-2 virus while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u2022interruptions or delays in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at research and development laboratory facility;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies;\n\u2022interruption or delays to the Company's sourced discovery and clinical activities;\n\u2022increased cybersecurity risks due to the Company's reliance on internet technology and the number of its employees that are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities; and\n\u2022disruption or constraints at manufacturers, which could result in product manufacturing delays.\nIt is highly uncertain and difficult to predict the full extent of the economic impact brought by and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic; the pandemic could still result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company's ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect its liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic could materially affect its business and value of Company's common stock.\nThe global SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and the Company will continue to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic situation closely. The ultimate impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of the potential impacts on its business, clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole.\nEven if the Company obtains regulatory approval for any of its product candidates, it may be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations or post-marketing commitments as specified by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in additional costs associated with those commitments.\nIf the Company obtains regulatory approval for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or any other product candidate, such approved products will be subject to continual regulatory review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, including labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and the Company may be subject to penalties if it fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences unanticipated problems with such products.\nIf FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of the Company's product candidates, including OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), as well as Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for any clinical trials that the Company conducts post-approval, all of which may result in significant expense and limit its ability to successfully commercialize such products. In addition, any regulatory approvals that the Company receives for its product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications or conditions of use for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product.\nAny later discovery of previously unknown problems with the Company product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with its third party manufacturers\u2019 processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by the Company, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe Company's ongoing regulatory requirements may also change from time to time, potentially harming or making costlier its commercialization efforts. It cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or other countries. If the Company is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if it's not able to maintain regulatory compliance, it may lose any marketing approval that it may have obtained and it may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect its business.\nThe Company faces significant competition, and if its competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than the Company does or that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the product candidates the Company develops, its commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted. The Company's product candidates will, if approved, also compete with existing branded, generic and off-label products.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. The Company faces competition with respect to OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease, and will face competition with respect to OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for other indications and any other product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nThe dry eye disease market is already served by a variety of competing products. Many of these existing products have achieved widespread acceptance among ECPs, patients and payors. In addition, certain of these products are available, or may become available, on an over-the-counter or generic basis, and the Company product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to ECPs, patients or payors to justify a higher price compared to such products. In many cases, insurers or other third party payors, particularly Medicare, seek to encourage the use of generic products.\nThe Company's commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than the\nCompany's products. The competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than the Company may obtain approval for its candidates, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before the Company is able to enter the market.\nIn addition, the Company's ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors, particularly Medicare, seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently being used for certain of the indications that it is pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years.\nMany of the companies against which the Company is competing or against which it may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than it does. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of the Company's competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with the Company in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the Company's programs.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against the Company, it may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of its products.\nThe Company's business exposes it to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of the Company's development programs. If product candidates are approved for marketing, such claims could still result in an FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority investigation of the safety and effectiveness of such products, the Company's manufacturing processes and facilities or its marketing programs. These investigations could potentially lead to a recall of its products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in injury to the Company's reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and its resources, initiation of investigations by regulators, substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants, the inability to commercialize the Company's product candidates and decreased demand for its product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. The Company currently has product liability insurance that it believes is appropriate for its stage of development and may need to obtain higher levels prior to marketing any of its product candidates, if approved. Any insurance it have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities and, if judgments exceed the Company's insurance coverage, could adversely affect its results of operations and business and cause the stock price to decline. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, the Company may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against losses, including those caused by product liability claims.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing the Company's product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect its business.\nThe Company plans to seek regulatory approval of its product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, it expects that it will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if it obtains the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022differing regulatory requirements and reimbursement regimes in foreign countries;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022challenges enforcing the Company's contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with international operations may materially adversely affect the Company's ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nPursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, effective December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement or otherwise, could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, the Company may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for any product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf the Company is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for its technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, the Company may not be able to compete effectively in its markets.\nThe Company relies upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to its development programs and product candidates. The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates. The Company seeks to protect its proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to its development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and the Company may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nThe patents and patent applications that the Company owns may fail to result in issued patents with claims that protect OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or other product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to the Company's patents and patent applications has been found, which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or be used to invalidate a patent. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or other product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to the Company could deprive it of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that it may develop. Further, if the Company encounters delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which it could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that the Company or any of its potential future collaborators will be successful in protecting its product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, or USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process, the noncompliance with which can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, and partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction;\n\u2022patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u2022patents may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022the Company's competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than the Company does and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or block the Company's ability to make, use and sell its product candidates;\n\u2022there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u2022countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nThe patent prosecution process is also expensive and time consuming, and the Company may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that the Company will fail to identify patentable aspects of its research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if the Company chooses to license\ncertain patent rights in the future from third parties, it may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of such patent applications, or to maintain the patents, directed to technology that it licenses from those third parties. The Company may also require the cooperation of its future licensor, if any, in order to enforce the licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided. Therefore, any licensed patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Company's business. The Company cannot be certain that patent prosecution and maintenance activities by any of its future licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which may affect the validity and enforceability of such patents or any patents that may issue from such applications. If they fail to do so, this could cause the Company to lose rights in any applicable intellectual property that it in-licenses, and as a result its ability to develop and commercialize products or product candidates may be adversely affected and it may be unable to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nIf the patent applications the Company holds or may in-license in the future with respect to its development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or other product candidates, it could dissuade other companies from collaborating with the Company to develop product candidates, and threaten its ability to commercialize OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or other product candidates. Any such outcome could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been and will continue to be the subject of litigation and new legislation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect the Company's rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, many countries restrict the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body. Publications in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, the Company cannot know with certainty whether it was the first to make the inventions claimed in its own patents or pending patent applications, or that it were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result of these and other factors, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of the Company patent rights are highly uncertain. The Company's pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect its technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of the Company patents or narrow the scope of its patent protection.\nMoreover, the Company may be subject to a third party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging its patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of defending patents or enforcing its proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation can be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, the Company's patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize its technology or products and compete directly with the Company, without payment to it, or result in its inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by the Company's patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and patents in which the Company has an interest may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit the Company ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of its technology and products. Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay incurred by the USPTO in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment). The scope of patent protection may also be limited.\nWithout patent protection for the Company's current or future product candidates, it may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, the Company's patent portfolio may not provide it with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to its own.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates, one or more of the Company's U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). This extension is based on the first\napproved use of a product and is limited to only one patent that covers the approved product, the approved use of the product, or a method of manufacturing the product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with the Company assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to its patents, or may grant more limited extensions than the Company requests. The Company may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time-period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than the Company requests. If it is unable to extend the expiration date of its existing patents or obtain new patents with longer expiry dates, the Company's competitors may be able to take advantage of its investment in development and clinical trials by referencing its clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing products following its patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and the Company's patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on the Company's international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If the Company or any of its licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, or other product candidates, the Company's competitors may be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on its business.\nThe Company may not identify relevant third party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third party patent, which might adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that any of its patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can it be certain that it has identified each and every third party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of its current and future product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history. The Company's interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact its ability to market its products. The Company may incorrectly determine that its products are not covered by a third party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party\u2019s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. The Company's determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that it considers relevant may be incorrect, and its failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact its ability to develop and market its products.\nThird party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate the Company's patents or other proprietary rights, may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and any other product candidates.\nThe commercial success depends in part on the Company avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, derivation, and administrative law proceedings, inter partes review, and post-grant review before the USPTO, as well as oppositions and similar processes in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which the Company and its collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as the Company gains greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that the Company product candidates or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that the Company is infringing their patents or employing their proprietary technology without authorization.\nAlso, there may be third party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of the Company's current and future product candidates.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that current or future product candidates may infringe.\nThe Company is aware of two issued U.S. patents owned by Pfizer (U.S. Pat. No.: 7,265,119 (the \u2018119) and 6,890,927 (the \u2018927) that Pfizer has listed in the Orange Book as covering its varenicline tartrate product, which is marketed as Chantix as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. Certain claims of these three patents are directed toward the compound varenicline tartrate and related salts thereof, and therefore may be relevant to the Company's candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. Of the two issued patents, the Company anticipates that both will be in force at the time that it could expect to receive FDA approval of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and on October 18, 2019, the Company entered into a non-exclusive patent license for these patents. However, even with the aforementioned license, the Company cannot provide assurances that third parties won\u2019t allege infringement, which could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or other product candidates.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patent rights in the future and claim that use of the Company technologies infringes upon their rights. If any third party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of the Company's product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process, methods of treating certain diseases or conditions that it is pursuing with its product candidates, its formulations including combination therapies, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block its ability to commercialize such product candidate unless the Company obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the Company may be subject to claims that it is infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the extent that the Company's employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for the Company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nParties making claims against the Company may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block its ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of its current and future product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from the Company's business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against the Company, it may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign its affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. the Company cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, the Company may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance its research or allow commercialization of its product candidates, and it has done so from time to time. It may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, the Company would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of its product candidates, which could harm its business significantly. It cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against its product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting its sales, or, with respect to its sales, an obligation on its part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of the litigation as well as results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of the Company's existing products, programs or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of shares of the Company's common stock may decline. Such announcements could also harm its reputation or the market for future products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents, the patents of any licensors or its other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate its patents, the patents of its licensors or its other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use or misappropriations, the Company may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more patent of the Company or any of its current or future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that the Company's patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of the Company's patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put its patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against the Company such as claims asserting that its patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information\nfrom the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. The Company cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which it and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For any patents and patent applications that it licenses from third parties, the Company may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of such licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, it would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on its current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm its business.\nThe Company may not be able to prevent, alone or with its licensors, misappropriation of its intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. The Company's business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer it a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce its intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract the management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the Company's confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of the Company's common shares.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, the Company may not be in a position to enforce its intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, it may conclude that even if a third party is infringing its in-licensed patents, any patents that may be issued as a result of its future patent applications, or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of the Company or its stockholders. In such cases, the Company may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nChanges in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing the Company's ability to protect its products.\nThe United States has enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to the Company ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken the Company's ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that the Company has licensed or that it might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken the Company's ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that the Company has licensed or that it may obtain in the future.\nThe Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could impair its business.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents covering OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, OC-02 and any future product candidate throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use the Company's technologies in jurisdictions where it has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where it may have or obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These unauthorized products may compete with the Company's products in such jurisdictions and take away the Company's market share where it does not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nThe Company's future reliance on third parties may require the Company to share its trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that the Company's trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause the Company expects to rely on third parties to manufacture OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and any other product candidates, and it expects to collaborate with third parties on the continuing development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and any other product candidates, it must, at times, share trade secrets with them. The Company also expects to conduct R&D programs that may require it to share trade secrets under the terms of its partnerships or agreements with CROs. The\nCompany seeks to protect its proprietary technology in part by entering into agreements containing confidentiality and use restrictions and obligations, including material transfer agreements, consulting agreements, manufacturing and supply agreements, confidentiality agreements or other similar agreements with its advisors, employees, contractors, CMOs, CROs, other service providers and consultants prior to disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose the Company's confidential information, including its trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by the Company's competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that the Company's proprietary position is based, in part, on its know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of the Company's trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair its competitive position and may have an adverse effect on business and results of operations.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of the Company's advisors, employees, third party contractors CMOs, CROs, other service providers and consultants to publish data potentially relating to trade secrets, although the agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. Despite the Company's efforts to protect its trade secrets, the Company's competitors may discover its trade secrets, either through breach of agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of the third party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of the Company's trade secrets would impair its competitive position and have an adverse impact on business.\nThe Company may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.\nThe Company employs individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, or at research institutions. Although the Company seeks to protect its ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that its agreements with employees, collaborators, and other third parties with whom it does business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to the Company, it may be subject to claims that it or its employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of its employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. It may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in the Company's patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if the Company fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, it may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if the Company is successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to its management and other employees.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to its competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by its intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect its business, or permit the Company to maintain its competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to the Company's current and future product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that it owns;\n\u2022others may be able to make product that is similar to the Company's current and future product candidates it intends to commercialize that is not covered by the patents that the Company exclusively licensed and has the right to enforce;\n\u2022the Company, any of its future licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that it owns;\n\u2022the Company or any of its future licensor might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of its inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of the Company's technologies without infringing its intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that the Company's future patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that the Company owns may not provide it with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022the Company's competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where it does not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in the Company's major commercial markets; and\n\u2022the Company may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nAny collaboration or partnership arrangements that the Company may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect its ability to develop and commercialize its products.\nAny future collaborations that the Company enters into may not be successful. The success of its collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of its collaborators. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include that:\n\u2022collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations;\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of the Company's products or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on trial or test results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with the Company's current and future product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities;\n\u2022the Company could grant exclusive rights to its collaborators that would prevent it from collaborating with others;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly maintain or defend its intellectual property rights or may use its intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate its intellectual property or proprietary information or expose the Company to potential liability;\n\u2022disputes may arise between the Company and a collaborator that causes the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of its current or future products or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated, and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable current or future products;\n\u2022collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering the Company's products that results from its collaborating with them, and in such cases, it would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property; and\n\u2022a collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nIf the Company's future trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then it may not be able to build name recognition in markets of interest and its business may be adversely affected.\nThe Company intends to use registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names to brand and market itself and its products. The Company's trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. The Company may not be able to protect its rights to these trademarks and trade names, which it needs to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in the markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to the Company's, thereby impeding its ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the Company's registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if the Company is unable to establish name recognition based on its trademarks and trade names, then it may not be able to compete effectively and its business may be adversely affected. The Company may license its trademarks and trade names to third parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach of these agreements or misuse of such trademarks and tradenames by the Company's licensees may jeopardize its rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with its trademarks and trade names. The Company efforts to enforce or protect its proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect its business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to comply with its obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, including its license agreement with Pfizer, such agreements may be terminated, the Company may be required to pay damages and it could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting its product candidates.\nThe Company currently and may in the future license from third parties certain intellectual property relating to current and future product candidates. If the Company breaches any material obligations, or uses the intellectual property licensed to it in an unauthorized manner, it may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in it being unable to develop, manufacture, and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Specifically, the Company's license agreement with Pfizer can be terminated by Pfizer upon 60 days\u2019 written notice for the Company's uncured material breach or 30 days following non-payment or immediately upon the Company's insolvency.\nDisputes may arise between the Company and its licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022whether and the extent to which the Company's technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022the Company's right to sublicense patents and other rights to third parties;\n\u2022the Company's diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to its development and commercialization of its product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022its right to transfer or assign the license; and\n\u2022the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by any of the Company's licensors and the Company and its partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that the Company licenses prevents or impairs its ability to maintain its licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, it may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nIn addition, certain of the Company's current or future agreements with third parties may limit or delay its ability to consummate certain transactions, may impact the value of those transactions, or may limit its ability to pursue certain activities.\nFurther, the Company or its current or future licensors, if any, may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, it may miss potential opportunities to strengthen its patent position. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of the Company's patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope, or requests for patent term adjustments. If the Company or its current or future licensors fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If the Company's current or future licensors are not fully cooperative or disagree with it as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form, preparation, prosecution, or enforcement of the Company's patents or patent applications, such patents may be invalid and/or unenforceable, and such applications may never result in valid, enforceable patents. Any of these outcomes could impair the Company's ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on its business.\nIn addition, even where the Company has the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications under a license from third parties, it may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of its predecessors or licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the Company assuming control over patent prosecution.\nThe Company's acquired technologies and current or future licensed technology may be subject to retained rights. The Company's predecessors or licensors may retain certain rights under their agreements with the Company, including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether the Company's predecessors or future licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses, and it could incur substantial expenses to enforce its rights to the Company's licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nIf the Company is limited in its ability to utilize acquired technologies or current or future licensed technologies, or if it loses its rights to critical acquired or in-licensed technology, it may be unable to successfully develop, out-license, market and sell its products, which could prevent or delay new product introductions. the Company's business strategy depends on the successful development of acquired technologies, and current or future licensed technology, into commercial products. Therefore, any limitations on the Company's ability to utilize these technologies may impair its ability to develop, out-license or market and sell its product candidates.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf the FDA does not conclude that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray satisfies the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA), or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as the Company expects, the approval pathway for those product candidates may take longer, cost more or entail greater complications and risks than anticipated, and may not be successful.\nThe Company submitted an NDA for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in December 2020. The Company is seeking FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA permits the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) where some or all of the data required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Company's ability to rely on certain of the FDA\u2019s findings of safety and effectiveness in\napproval of another NDA or on studies published in the scientific literature will depend on its ability to demonstrate the relevance to OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray.\nIn particular, the Company conducted ZEN, a comparative pharmacokinetic \"bridge\" trial, to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally (Chantix\u00ae) in order to reference certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline from the Agency\u2019s review of the Chantix NDA. If the FDA does not accept or disagrees with the Company's conclusions from ZEN or the data required for approval of its Section 505(b)(2) NDA are different than anticipated, the Company may be required to conduct additional development activities or studies or provide additional data and information to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway on its proposed timeline. Such delays could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, which could materially adversely impact the Company's competitive position and growth prospects.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If the Company is ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, it will be unable to generate product revenue and its business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that the Company\u2019s data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other data. Even if the Company eventually completes clinical testing and receives approval of any regulatory filing for its product candidates, the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may approve its product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than it originally requested. For example, the fact that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray did not achieve certain secondary endpoints in ONSET-2 could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain its desired label for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, if approved. The Company has not submitted for, or obtained, regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of its existing product candidates or any product candidates it may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nFurther, development of the Company\u2019s product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond its control. For example, a U.S. federal government shutdown or budget sequestration, such as ones that occurred during 2013, 2018 and 2019, or diversion of resources to currently handle the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic public health emergency and pandemic may result in significant reductions to the FDA\u2019s budget, employees and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods, potentially affecting the Company\u2019s ability to progress development of its product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates. In addition, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic may cause the FDA to allocate additional resources to product candidates focused on treating related illnesses, which could lead to longer approval processes for the Company\u2019s product candidates. Moreover, some of the Company\u2019s analyses of the ONSET-2 clinical trial data are post-hoc analyses and, although it believes that these post-hoc analyses can provide additional information regarding results from this clinical trial, retrospective analyses can result in the introduction of bias and may be given less weight by the FDA, including for purposes of determining whether to accept the Company\u2019s NDA for filing or approving its NDA. Finally, the Company\u2019s competitors may file citizens\u2019 petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that its product candidates, or the clinical trials that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by its competitors could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any of the Company\u2019s NDAs.\nApplications for the Company\u2019s product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation, or results of the Company's clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may determine that the Company\u2019s product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude the Company\u2019s obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use;\n\u2022the population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and safety in the full population for which the Company seeks approval;\n\u2022the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the Company\u2019s interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022the data collected from clinical trials of the Company\u2019s product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022the Company may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate\u2019s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u2022the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third party manufacturers with which the Company contracts for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering the Company\u2019s clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in the Company failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of its product candidates, which could materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation.\nIn the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect the Company's future results of operations. Existing regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of the product candidates. The Company cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If the Company is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if it is unable to maintain regulatory compliance, it may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and the Company may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively, the ACA), was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\nThe ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for \u201cline extensions\u201d (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.\nThere remain judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.\nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when the Supreme Court will make a decision. Although the United States Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to\nreview and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is also unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and the Company's business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for the Company's product candidates, if approved, and accordingly, the financial operations.\nMoreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent \u201cprinciples\u201d for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. In addition, the Trump administration previously released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of prescription drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule, on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nThe Company expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that the Company receives for any approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the Company from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize its product candidates.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect the Company's ability to profitably commercialize its product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase the Company's operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and\napproaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of the Company's product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect its ability to commercialize its product candidates, if approved.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. The Company cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, particularly in light of the recent presidential election, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of the Company's product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject the Company to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nThe Company's employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities. Misconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, comply with data privacy and security laws and accurately report financial information or data or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to the Company's reputation. Although the Company has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics with respect to its employees, agents and contractors, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by these parties, and the precautions the Company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting it from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, the Company is a subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against the Company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on business, including the imposition of significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations.\nIf the Company fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, it could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe Company and any contract manufacturers and suppliers it engages are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. Its operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Its operations also produce hazardous waste. The Company generally contracts with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. It cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the Company's use of hazardous materials, it could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed its resources. Under certain environmental laws, it could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at the Company's current or past facilities and at third party facilities. It also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair the Company's research, product development and manufacturing efforts. In addition, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or waste. Although the Company maintains workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover it for costs and expenses it may incur due to injuries to its employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. It does not currently maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against the Company in connection with storage or disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, it could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding its resources,\nand its clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, the Company may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of the Company's product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that it will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of its product candidates in other jurisdictions. The FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from trials conducted in locations outside of their jurisdiction.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of the Company's product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that it will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA or EMA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of the product candidate in those countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that the Company intends to charge for its products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for the Company and could delay or prevent the introduction of its products in certain countries. If the Company or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, its target market will be reduced and ability to realize the full market potential of its product candidates will be harmed.\nIn addition, the Company may choose to conduct international clinical trials. The acceptance of study data by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority from clinical trials conducted outside of their respective jurisdictions may be subject to certain conditions. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (1) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (2) the trials are performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (3) audits by regulatory authorities of the clinical data do not identify significant data integrity issues. Additionally, the FDA\u2019s clinical trial requirements, including the adequacy of the patient population studied and statistical powering, must be met. In addition, such foreign trials are subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA, EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of its applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA, EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of the Company's business plan, and which may result in its product candidates not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nThe Company's business activities are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which it operates, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit the Company's ability to compete in foreign markets and subject it to liability if it violates them.\nThe Company recently completed a trial and may plan to initiate additional trials in countries other than the United States. The Company's business activities are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which it operates. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The Company's business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the healthcare providers, including ECPs, who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, its dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. The SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of the Company's employees, agents or contractors, or those of its affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, the closing down of its facilities,\nrequirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of the Company's business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on the Company's ability to offer its products in one or more countries and could materially damage its reputation, its brand, international activities, its ability to attract and retain employees and its business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company's products may be subject to U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and regulations. Governmental regulation of the import or export of its products, or its failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for the Company's products, when applicable, could harm its international sales and adversely affect its revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of the Company's products may create delays in the introduction of its products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of its products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If the Company fails to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, it may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including a denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of its products by, or in its decreased ability to export products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of the Company's products or limitation on its ability to export or sell access to its products would likely adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf any of the Company's product candidates are approved and the Company is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of those products, it may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as the Company's product candidates, if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. For example, if the Company receives marketing approval for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray as a treatment for the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, physicians may nevertheless use the product for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If the Company is found to have promoted such off-label uses, it may become subject to significant liability. The U.S. federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If the Company cannot successfully manage the promotion of its product candidates, if approved, it could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDisruptions at the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of the Company's business may rely, which could negatively impact its business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which the Company's operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect the Company's business. For example, in recent years, including in 2013, 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most domestic and foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products and only restarted domestic inspections on a risk-based basis in July 2020. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process the Company's regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Further, in the Company's operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact its ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue its operations.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm the Company's future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.\nCompany's operations, and those of its CROs, CMOs, suppliers, and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war (including trade wars), political instability or other conflict, and other natural or man-made disasters or other events outside of the Company's control that can disrupt business. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm the Company's operations and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. For example, the Company relies on third party manufacturers to produce and process its product candidates. The Company's ability to obtain supplies of its product candidates or other necessary supplies could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. All of the Company's operations including its corporate headquarters are located in a single location in Princeton, New Jersey. Damage or extended periods of interruption to its corporate, development or research facilities due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, communications failure, unauthorized entry or other events could cause the Company to cease or delay development of some or all of its product candidates. Although the Company maintains property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities, the insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances and Company's business may be seriously harmed by such delays and interruption.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nThe Company relies on third parties to conduct its clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research and studies.\nThe Company does not have the ability to independently conduct its clinical trials. The Company currently relies on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct its current and potential future clinical trials of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates, and the Company expects to continue to rely upon third parties to conduct additional clinical trials of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates. Third parties have a significant role in the conduct of its clinical trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not the Company's employees, and except for remedies available to the Company under its agreements with such third party, it has limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that any such third party will devote to the Company's clinical trials. Some of these third parties may terminate their engagements with the Company at any time. If it needs to enter into alternative arrangements with a third party, it would delay the Company's development activities.\nThe Company's reliance on these third parties for such development activities will reduce its control over these activities but will not relieve it of its regulatory responsibilities. For example, the Company will remain responsible for ensuring that each of its clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires the Company to comply with GCP standards, regulations for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The EMA also requires the Company to comply with similar standards. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If the Company or any of its CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in the clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require the Company to perform additional clinical trials before approving its marketing applications. The Company cannot provide assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of its clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, the clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current cGMP regulations. The Company's failure to comply with these regulations may require it to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process. The Company also is required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nThe third parties the Company relies on for these services may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be its competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct the Company's clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the Company's stated protocols, it will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for its product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in its efforts to, successfully commercialize its product candidates.\nThe Company contracts with third parties for the production of its product candidates for preclinical studies and ongoing clinical trials, and expects to continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that the Company will not have sufficient quantities of its product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair its development or commercialization efforts.\nThe Company does not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of its product candidates for use in development and commercialization. It relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third party manufacturers\nfor the production of its product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of its organization. The Company does not have long-term supply agreements. If it were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, the Company could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials.\nThe Company expects to continue to rely on third party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of its product candidates for which it obtains marketing approval. It may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements with third party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if it is able to establish agreements with third party manufacturers, reliance on third party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022the failure of the third party to manufacture the Company's product candidates according to its schedule, or at all, including if its third party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over its product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between the Company and them;\n\u2022the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by the Company's third party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for the Company;\n\u2022the breach by the third party contractors of the Company's agreements with them;\n\u2022the failure of third party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including manufacturing drug supply pursuant to strictly enforced cGMPs;\n\u2022the failure of the third party to manufacture the Company's product candidates according to its specifications;\n\u2022the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;\n\u2022clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\n\u2022the misappropriation of the Company's proprietary information, including its trade secrets and know-how.\nThe Company does not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and is dependent on, contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances and finished drug products. Third party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to the Company's specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, the Company does not have control over the ability of its contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of its product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, the Company may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact its ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market its product candidates, if approved. The Company's failure, or the failure of its third party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of the Company's product candidates, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of the Company's product candidates and harm its business and results of operations.\nThe Company currently relies on single source manufacturers and suppliers for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. If it decides to move to different or add additional manufacturers and suppliers in the future, any such transition or addition would require significant efforts in testing and validating the manufacturing and formulation process and could result in delays or other issues, which could have an adverse effect on the supply of the Company's product candidates.\nThe Company's current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of its product candidates may adversely affect its future profit margins and its ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nThe Company may pursue collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of its product candidates. If it decides to pursue collaborations, but is not able to establish those collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, it may have to alter its development and commercialization plans. If it does enter into collaborations that are not successful, it may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nThe Company's development programs and the potential commercialization of its product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. It may seek to selectively form collaborations to expand its capabilities, potentially accelerate research and development activities and provide for commercialization activities by third parties. Any of these\nrelationships may require the Company to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase its near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute its existing stockholders, or disrupt management and business.\nThe Company would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Whether it reaches a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon the Company's assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to the Company's ownership of intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The potential collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with the Company for its product candidate. Further, the Company may not be successful in its efforts to establish a collaboration or other alternative arrangements for future product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view them as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nIn addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if the Company is successful in entering into a collaboration, the terms and conditions of that collaboration may restrict it from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators.\nIf and when the Company seeks to enter into collaborations, it may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to do so, it may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales and marketing activities, or increase expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at its own expense. If the Company elects to increase its expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, it may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company does not have sufficient funds, it may not be able to further develop its product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nThe Company's business operations and current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, consultants, patient organizations, customers, CROs and third party payors in connection with its current and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose the Company to, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which the Company obtains marketing approval. The Company's current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, including ECPs, clinical investigators, CROs, third party payors and customers may expose it to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which the Company markets, sells and distributes its products for which it obtains marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;\n\u2022analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding their payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiology assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on \u201ccovered entities,\u201d including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective \u201cbusiness associates\u201d that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nSome state laws require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Some state laws require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products. Certain state and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State, federal and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, the collection and use of health data in the EU is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which extends the geographical scope of EU data protection law to non-EU entities under certain conditions, tightens existing EU data protection principles, creates new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in substantial fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR may increase the Company's responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that it processes and it may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the GDPR. This may be onerous and if the Company's efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful, it could adversely affect its business in the EU.\nEfforts to ensure that the Company's current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve on-going substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that the Company's business practices, including the provision of stock options as compensation for consulting services to physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom may be in a position to recommend, purchase and/or prescribe the Company's product candidates, if approved, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If the Company's operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of the Company's operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if the Company is successful in defending against\nany such actions that may be brought against it, its business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom the Company expects to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Common Stock\nThe Company will need substantial additional funding in the future. If it is unable to raise capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, it may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. The Company's operations have consumed significant amounts of cash since inception, and it expects its expenses to increase in connection with ongoing activities, particularly as it continues to conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates. Even if one or more of the product candidates that the Company develops is approved for commercial sale, including OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, it anticipates incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. The Company's expenses could increase beyond expectations if the Company is required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or preclinical studies in addition to those that it currently anticipates. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. Because the design and outcome of its planned and anticipated clinical trials are highly uncertain, it cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any product candidate it develops.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $192.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Although the Company believes that its available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its planned operations for at least 12 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, this belief is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond its control, could cause the Company to consume capital significantly faster than it currently anticipates, and it may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.\nAdvancing the development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates will require a significant amount of capital. The Company's existing cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund all of the activities that are necessary to complete the development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and other product candidates. It will continue to require additional capital to develop its product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. The Company may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing, which may dilute stockholders or restrict operating activities. The amount of additional capital the Company will need to raise will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, timing, rate of progress and costs of the Company's drug discovery efforts, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for its product candidates;\n\u2022the number and scope of clinical programs the Company decides to pursue;\n\u2022the cost, timing and outcome of preparing for and undergoing regulatory review of its product candidates;\n\u2022the scope and costs of development and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u2022the cost and timing associated with commercializing of the Company's product candidates, if they receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the extent to which the Company acquires or in-licenses other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing the Company's intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the Company's ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022the Company's efforts to enhance operational systems and its ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of its product candidates and, ultimately, the sale of its products, following FDA approval;\n\u2022the Company implementation of operational, financial and management systems; and\n\u2022any current or future potential effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic on the Company's business, operations, preclinical and clinical development and commercialization timelines and plans; and\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company.\nThe Company does not have any committed external source of funds. Adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company's failure to raise capital as and when needed or on acceptable terms would have a negative impact on the Company's business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition and its ability to\npursue business strategy, and the Company may have to delay, reduce the scope of, suspend or eliminate one or more of its research-stage programs, clinical trials or future commercialization efforts.\nAn active trading market for the Company's common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough the Company's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the market for the Company's shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. The Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock will trade or whether an active trading market will be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the market value of their shares and may impair the Company's ability to raise capital.\nThe price of the Company's stock may be volatile, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe trading price of the Company's common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which it cannot control. The stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors, including the potential impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of the Company's common stock, regardless of its actual operating performance. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u2022the timing and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of the Company's product candidates or those of its competitors;\n\u2022the success of competitive products or announcements by potential competitors of their product development efforts;\n\u2022regulatory actions with respect to the Company's products or its competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in the Company's growth rate relative to its competitors;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the Company;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022changes or expected changes to government and such implications for the health care industry;\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of the Company's shares;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022sales of the Company's common stock by the Company, its insiders or other stockholders;\n\u2022expiration of market stand-off or lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or any of a broad range of other risks, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of the Company's common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of the Company's common stock in the public market could cause its stock price to fall.\nHolders of an aggregate of 14,193,281 shares of the Company's common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require it to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that the Company may file for itself or other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-8 registering 5,822,484 shares of common stock that it may issue under its equity incentive plans. As a result, shares registered under this registration statement on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market subject to the satisfaction of vesting arrangements and the exercise of such options and volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to the Company's existing stockholders, restrict its operations or require the Company to relinquish rights to its product candidates on unfavorable terms to the Company.\nThe Company may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including up-front payments and milestone payments from strategic collaborations. To the extent that it raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity securities, investors' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants, increased fixed payment obligations or other restrictions that may affect the Company's business. If the Company raises additional funds through up-front payments or milestone payments pursuant to strategic collaborations with third parties, it may have to relinquish valuable rights to its product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to it. In addition, the Company may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if it believes it has sufficient funds for its current or future operating plans.\nThe Company's principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of Company's stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of the Company's capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 73% of its voting stock. As a result, this group of stockholders will have the ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of the Company's organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for the Company's common stock that investors may feel are in their best interest as one of the Company's stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with other stockholders' interests and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for the Company's common stock.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and it cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make the Company's common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). For as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, it intends to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u2022being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure in the Company's periodic reports;\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company's periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u2022exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThe Company cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because the Company may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company's common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for common stock and the Company's stock price may be more volatile.\nThe Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date it qualifies as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which it has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has irrevocably elected not to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in the Company's business could significantly affect its financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company has been incurring increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. Additionally, if the Company fails to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, its ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nThe Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq. Company's management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, to comply with these rules and regulations, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, and these expenses may increase even more after it is no longer an \"emerging growth company\".\nIn addition, the Company has been and will be required to incur costs and obligations in order to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under these rules, beginning with this Annual Report, the Company is required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and once it ceases to be an emerging growth company, it will be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. As disclosed in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company identified two material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Management identified certain measures necessary to strengthen the internal control over financial reporting and to address the material weaknesses, and implemented them in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. The Company has remediated the material weaknesses and management has determined that, as of December\u202f31, 2020, the internal controls were designed and operating effectively and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period for management to conclude that the material weaknesses have been remediated. These efforts to document, evaluate, remediate and maintain the Company's internal control over financial reporting, has been and will continue to be both costly and challenging. In this regard, it will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are designed and operating effectively, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nIf the Company is not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if it is unable to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of the Company's stock could decline and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which the common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nThe Company does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of the stock.\nThe Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. The Company currently anticipates that it will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of its business and does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to any appreciation in the value of their stock.\nProvisions in the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in its management and, therefore, depress the market price of its common stock.\nThe Company's restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of its common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in its management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of the Company's board are elected at one time;\n\u2022permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022provide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of the Company's stockholders;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that the board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill);\n\u2022eliminate the ability of the stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting;\n\u2022authorize the board of directors to amend the bylaws;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company's board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022require a super-majority vote of stockholders to amend some provisions described above.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL) prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of Company's voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of the Company's capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Company's common stock.\nThe Company's amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.\nThe Company's amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company's behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against the Company arising under the DGCL, its amended and restated certificate of incorporation or its amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of the Company's securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. If a court were to find this exclusive-forum provision in the Company's amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm its business. Nothing in the Company's amended and restated bylaws, including the exclusive-forum provision, precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or if they publish adverse or misleading research or reports, regarding the Company, its business or its market, the stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company's common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about it, its business or the Company's market. If no additional securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the Company's stock price could be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who cover the Company issue adverse or misleading research or reports regarding it, its business model, intellectual property, stock performance or its market, or if the Company's operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, its stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on it regularly, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe Company may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against the Company could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm Company's business.\nThe Company disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nThe Company has designed its disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information it must disclose in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. The Company believes that any\ndisclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the Company's control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.", "PERMNO": 19016, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OYST"}
