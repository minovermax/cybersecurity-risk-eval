RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information included in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe are substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates.\nTo date, we have invested substantial efforts and financial resources in the research and development of neuromodulator product candidates. Our success as a company is substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In December 2018, we completed Phase 3 clinical development for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although we have successfully completed the Phase 3 clinical development program, we have not received FDA approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in glabellar lines and the timing to receive FDA approval is uncertain.\nWe submitted the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines in November 2019, which was accepted by the FDA on February 5, 2020, and the PDUFA target action date was initially set for November 25, 2020. On November 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on the BLA. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Though our BLA is still under review, the FDA did not indicate there were any other review issues at the time beyond the on-site inspection. Currently, however, the FDA is still subject to restrictions on travel related to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore there may be continued delays. A delay in obtaining FDA approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines as a result of the FDA travel restrictions or otherwise would delay commercialization and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Further, failure to obtain FDA approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines due to issues with the FDA\u2019s inspection of our manufacturing facility or for any other reason would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also have completed and have ongoing clinical trials evaluating DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for other indications. Our clinical trials may not have an effective design or generate positive results. For example, in November 2020, we released topline results from the Phase 2 study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the management of plantar fasciitis. The results of this study did demonstrate pain relief on the NPRS that was numerically greater from baseline than placebo. However, neither dose used in the study met the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo. As a result, we are not currently pursuing the plantar fasciitis indication, and we will focus our efforts on indications for muscle movement and pain disorder indications where the use of neuromodulators is well-established. In addition, in February 2021, we announced topline data from the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial. The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial achieved one co-primary endpoint, which evaluated the change in the MAS score from baseline, with demonstration of a statistically significant treatment benefit in the 500 unit treatment group compared with placebo. Statistical significance was not achieved on the second co-primary endpoint, however numerical improvement compared with placebo in all three doses on the PGIC assessment was achieved. Although we believe the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial provided sufficient data to inform our dosing strategy and design for a successful Phase 3 program, we cannot guarantee that the results of the Phase 3 program will meet the level of statistical significance or efficacy required by the FDA for approval.\nOur near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our business and generate revenue, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, including the receipt of FDA approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. Our longer-term prospects will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate and any future product candidates.\nThe preclinical, clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022a continuing delay in the FDA\u2019s approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, including as a result of delays in the site inspection conducted by the FDA of our manufacturing facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, observations made by the FDA during the site inspection or other reasons;\n\u2022disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chain, end user demand for our products, commercialization efforts, business operations, clinical trials and other aspects of our business resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including delays in regulatory approvals;\n\u2022timely completion of, or need to conduct additional clinical trials, including clinical trials for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar and any future product candidates, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the number and design of such trials and the accurate and satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;\n\u2022the timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022achieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates or approved products;\n\u2022our ability to successfully commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, if approved for marketing and sale, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022our ability to demonstrate and the market perception of the differentiation of our products on a consistent basis as compared to existing or future therapies, including as it relates to cost, safety, efficacy and other advantages;\n\u2022our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022our ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other similar foreign regulatory agencies, the safety and efficacy of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates through clinical trials;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates or future approved products and the continued acceptable safety profile of our products, if approved;;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our own or our current and any future potential strategic collaborators\u2019 distribution strategy and operations;\n\u2022our ability and the ability of any third-party partners to effectively and reliably manufacture supplies of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates for clinical trials and commercialization, if approved, and to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d);\n\u2022our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u2022the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse physicians or patients for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future products we may commercialize for therapeutic indications if approved;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future products we may commercialize for aesthetic indications if approved; and\n\u2022the ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms and in the time frames necessary to achieve our goals;\nOne or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidate to continue our business.\nWe are substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nIn September 2020, we became a commercial company and launched the Prestige Aesthetics Portfolio by introducing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. As of the date of this report, we have not generated revenue from the sale of any pharmaceutical product except the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nOur success as a company is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to generate revenue from the sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and successfully commercialize the other products in the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, which will depend on many factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022develop and execute our sales and marketing strategies for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022develop, maintain and manage the necessary sales, marketing and other capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate and commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, including in connection with our marketing and sale of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection;\n\u2022achieve, maintain and grow market acceptance of, and demand for, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and their potential advantages over and side effects compared to existing dermal fillers and products currently in clinical development;\n\u2022offer the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers at competitive prices as compared to alternative options, and our ability to achieve a suitable profit margin on our sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022collaborate with Teoxane to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities for the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products;\n\u2022adapt to additional changes to the label for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, that could place restrictions on how we market and sell the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, including as a result of adverse events observed in these or other studies;\n\u2022obtain adequate and timely supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers under the Teoxane Agreement, which has in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022comply with the terms of the Teoxane Agreement, including our obligations with respect to purchase quantities and marketing efforts;\n\u2022comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including medical device compliance as the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are Class III Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) devices under the FDCA;\n\u2022register as the initial importer of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers with the FDA and obtain necessary state prescription medical device distribution permits and hire and operationalize complaint and medical device vigilance services in support of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers; and\n\u2022establish agreements with third party logistics providers to distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to customers.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to continue to generate revenue from the sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and successfully commercialize the other products in the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, which may materially impact the success of our business. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by Teoxane, as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result of production delay, the initial product launch of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization strategy.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of the Teoxane Agreement, including by failing to meet certain obligations in connection with purchase and marketing of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, Teoxane may terminate the Teoxane Agreement, and we would have no further rights to distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. In addition, the lack of, or limited, complementary products to be offered by sales personnel in marketing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to continue our business.\nEven if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians and patients, and may not be commercially successful, which could harm our financial results and future prospects.\nThe degree and rate of market acceptance of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the safety and efficacy and duration of the product as compared to existing and future therapies;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for the treatment of those indications;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the extent to which physicians recommend the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection to their patients;\n\u2022the proper training and administration of our products by physicians and medical staff such that patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;\n\u2022patient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product and overall treatment experience;\n\u2022the potential and perceived advantages and cost of our products over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement and other aesthetic treatments in general, in the absence of third party payor reimbursement, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse physicians or patients for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future products we may commercialize for therapeutic indications;\n\u2022the revenue and profitability that our product will offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022the relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, including efforts by any third parties we engage;\n\u2022consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and our products in particular; and\n\u2022general consumer, patient and physician confidence and availability of practicing physicians, which may be impacted by general economic and political conditions, including challenges affecting the global economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny failure by our product candidates, if approved, or any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement that obtain regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would materially adversely affect our results of operations and delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nIn addition, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has only been used in clinical trials to date. Therefore, the commercial or real-world experience may yield different outcomes or patient experiences due to variations in injection techniques, dilution approaches and dosing levels employed by different physician and nurse injectors. As a result, these market-based approaches may differ from our clinical trial design and could negatively impact adoption.\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we or any collaboration partner may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug and biologic products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any collaboration partner are permitted to market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. Even though filed with the FDA, our BLA may receive a Complete Response Letter or another response from the FDA identifying deficiencies that must be addressed, rather than an approval. Obtaining regulatory approval of a BLA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Although Teoxane has received PMA approval for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, it must obtain PMA approval by the FDA for RHA\u00ae 1.\nIn addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u2022warning letters;\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022injunctions;\n\u2022withdrawal of approved products;\n\u2022product seizure or detention;\n\u2022product recalls;\n\u2022total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs; and\n\u2022refusal to approve PMAs or supplements to PMAs by our partners.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the U.S. or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical and clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nRegulatory approval of a BLA or PMA, or BLA or PMA supplement, is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense expended, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022a product candidate may not be deemed safe, effective, or of required quality;\n\u2022FDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022the FDA might not approve our third-party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u2022the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or do not gain approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the business of the FDA and may affect the business of the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) or other health authorities. In March 2020, the FDA announced the postponement of most foreign inspections due to the global impact of COVID-19 and, in July 2020, only restarted domestic inspections on a risk-based prioritization basis, and foreign inspections on a mission-critical basis. For domestic inspections, FDA is using a rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption to the normal functioning of government agencies occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. For instance, interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other applicable local or foreign regulatory agencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may cause delays in meetings related to planned or completed clinical trials and may affect the review and approval timelines for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates, including the BLA approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the treatment of glabellar lines. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally diverted healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials and may cause delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation and site inspection, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff. Further, delays in the operations of the FDA or other applicable local or foreign regulatory agencies may result in delays or difficulties in obtaining required inspections of the facilities where we or third parties with whom we contract manufacture any of our product candidates, or the raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates, which may affect the approval timeline for our product candidates, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the treatment of glabellar lines. For instance, before approving the BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which we plan to manufacture DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, and the FDA will not\napprove the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.\nThe RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are Class III medical devices that require PMA approval before they may be commercialized in the U.S. Although Teoxane has received PMA approval for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, we and Teoxane will be subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the manufacture, marketing, advertising, medical device reporting, sale, promotion, registration, and listing of these devices. For example, periodic reports must be submitted to the FDA as a condition of PMA approval. These reports include safety and effectiveness information about the device after its approval. Failure to submit such reports, or failure to submit the reports in a timely manner, could result in enforcement action by the FDA. Following its review of the periodic reports, the FDA might ask for additional information or initiate further investigation. Any failure to comply with the conditions of approval could result in the withdrawal of PMA approval and the inability to continue to market the device. The medical device regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more stringent over time, and we have no history of operating as a distributor of Class III medical devices. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, including recalls, Dear Doctor letters and negative publicity which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the benefits expected from the HintMD Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOn July 23, 2020, we completed the HintMD Acquisition. The anticipated benefits we expect from the HintMD Acquisition are based on projections and assumptions about our combined businesses with HintMD, which may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits within the anticipated time frame if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Achieving the benefits of the HintMD Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the business, operations and services of HintMD successfully and efficiently with our business and the commercial acceptance of the HintMD platform. The challenges involved in the integration and commercial success of the HintMD platform, which will be complex and time-consuming, include the following:\n\u2022significant issues with the acquired technology, security, product architecture and legal, regulatory and contractual compliance, among other matters that our due diligence process may have failed to identify;\n\u2022difficulties entering new markets and integrating new technologies in which we had no or limited direct experience prior to the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022our ability to comply with new and complex regulatory regimes and compliance standards applicable to the HintMD platform;\n\u2022technical or other difficulties faced by our aesthetic practice customers when using the HintMD platform, which may negatively impact Revance's existing or future customer relationships;\n\u2022limiting exposure to data and security breaches of consumer personal information used by the HintMD platform;\n\u2022retaining and managing existing relationships with HintMD\u2019s customer base;\n\u2022developing new product features for the HintMD platform;\n\u2022expanding sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the HintMD platform and expand the HintMD customer base;\n\u2022the HintMD platform's ability to create loyalty between physicians and their patients through repeated aesthetic treatments and increase the number of aesthetic procedures performed, including with products we offer;\n\u2022entry of competitors to the market, including those with greater resources, experience and name recognition; the timing of development and release of new products, features and functionality and pricing by competitors; our ability to adapt to technological advancement in comparison to our competitors; changes in user preferences and growth or contraction in the addressable market;\n\u2022the increased scale and complexity of our operations resulting from the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022retaining our key employees and key employees of HintMD; and\n\u2022minimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other important business objectives.\nFurther, the HintMD Acquisition has increased the size and scope of our business beyond the previous size and scope of either our or HintMD\u2019s previous businesses. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs, regulatory requirements and complexity. We have also incorporated as a part of our commercial strategy leveraging the HintMD platform to build a prestige aesthetics category and grow our U.S. aesthetics market opportunity. If we do not successfully manage the aforementioned issues and other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business of the size and complexity of HintMD, then we may need to alter our commercial strategy, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition and our revenue, expenses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may, adversely affect our financial condition and our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. An epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis could cause delays in regulatory approvals needed to commercialize our product candidates or interfere with enrollment and our ability to complete ongoing clinical trials on schedule or at all. The risk of a continued pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to cancel or defer aesthetic and elective procedures, avoid public places, including hospitals and physician offices, and cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain, manufacturing and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory. Certain of these risks have materialized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Newark, California due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We are unable to predict when the FDA will conduct the required inspection because of the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in March 2020 we paused enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial due to challenges related to the COVID-19 environment. We are unable to predict whether similar delays will occur or whether such delays will delay regulatory approvals.\nMany physician customers of the HintMD platform temporarily closed their offices and stopped performing procedures, and some that have reopened are now focusing on only essential procedures while deferring or cancelling non-essential procedures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has also impacted our sales professionals\u2019 ability to travel, and medical facilities and physician offices have limited access for non-patients, including our sales professionals, which has had a negative impact on our access to customers and our ability to introduce the HintMD platform and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to potential customers. We cannot be certain whether or to what extent these trends may continue, and if patients\u2019 financial circumstances or ability to or interest in receiving aesthetic procedures are materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic or public health crisis, we may be unable to generate meaningful revenue in the near term or at all.\nPort closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our drug products. Changes in U.S. and foreign trade policies or border closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d, which may reduce customer demand for goods exported out of the U.S. if the parties having to pay those retaliatory tariffs increase their prices, or if trading partners limit their trade with the U.S. If these\nconsequences are realized, the price to the consumer of aesthetic or therapeutic medical procedures from products exported out of the U.S. may increase, resulting in a material reduction in the demand for our future product candidates. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our potential sales and our business. In particular, under our Fosun License Agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and supplying it to Fosun, which would then develop commercialize, market and sell it in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. If this arrangement is restricted in any way due to the U.S.-China trade relationship or the COVD-19 pandemic, the contingent payments we are entitled to receive under the agreement, which are based on product sales, among other things, may be adversely affected. In addition, under the Teoxane Agreement, we are responsible for the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in the U.S., and rely on Teoxane for our entire supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which was previously delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and may again be delayed in the future. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization strategy.\nMoreover, an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, could require a complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities or cause employees to avoid our properties, which could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our businesses. For instance, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or other such orders by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted our operations, as employees who cannot perform their responsibilities from home are not able to report to work. In addition, we have had to put in place a work from home policy for all employees. Although we believe we have successfully integrated the work from home policy into the culture of our business, certain departments like clinical and manufacturing, are dependent on working on-site. The effective operation of these departments is critical to the completion of our clinical programs and, if the employees in these departments are subject to work from policies now or in the future, our business may be adversely impacted. In addition, our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity and employee morale, which may harm our business. In addition, this could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites, other important agencies and contractors, HintMD or RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers physician customers and other third parties with whom we do business.\nRisks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could also negatively impact the business or operations of our sourcing or manufacturing partners, contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nThe ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations or healthcare systems generally or the global economy as a whole will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19 pandemic, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWorldwide economic and market conditions, an unstable economy, a decline in consumer-spending levels and other adverse developments, including inflation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nMany economic and other factors are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, consumer and commercial credit availability, inflation, unemployment, consumer debt levels and other challenges affecting the global economy, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in the rates of unemployment, reduced access to credit and issues related to domestic and international politics may adversely affect consumer confidence and disposable income levels. Lower consumer confidence and disposable incomes could lead to reduced consumer spending and lower demand for our products and services. Decreases in the number of physicians and physician offices or financial hardships for physicians may also adversely affect distribution channels of our products. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. In addition, historically, during economic downturns, there have been reductions in spending on information technology as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions. The adverse impact of economic downturns may be particularly acute among small and medium-sized plastic surgery and dermatology practices offering elective aesthetic procedures, which comprise the majority of HintMD\u2019s customer base. If economic conditions deteriorate, current and prospective HintMD customers may elect to decrease their information technology budgets or cancel subscriptions to the HintMD platform, which would limit our ability to grow the HintMD\nplatform business. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic recession characterized by business closures and limited social interaction as well as higher levels of unemployment and reductions in working hours. Elective aesthetic procedures are discretionary and less of a priority for those patients that have lost their jobs, are furloughed, have reduced work hours or have to allocate their cash to other priorities and essential items. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience negative impacts to our business and financial results due to the continued perceived risk of infection or concern of a resurgence of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as COVID-19\u2019s global economic impact, including decreases in consumer discretionary spending and any economic slowdown or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could also limit our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. These factors could have a negative impact on our potential sales and operating results.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers could delay or prevent Teoxane from maintaining regulatory approval or obtaining additional regulatory approval for, or could negatively impact our sales of, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities withdrawing approval of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for any or all indications that have approval, including the use of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for specified aesthetic indications. We cannot assure you that patients receiving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers will not experience serious adverse events in the future that require submission of medical device reports to the FDA. Adverse events, including with respect to dermal filler products generally, may also negatively impact demand for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which could result in reduced sales. For example, facial swelling in patients with dermal filler cosmetic injections was reported as a serious adverse event in patients receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Teoxane may also be required to further update package inserts and patient information brochures of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers based on reports of adverse events or safety concerns, which could adversely affect acceptance of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in the market, make the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers less competitive or make it more difficult or expensive for us to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nThe Teoxane Agreement requires us to make specified annual minimum purchases of RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and to meet specified expenditure levels in connection with our marketing of RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in furtherance of the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, regardless of whether our commercialization efforts are successful. Such expenditure requirements may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and our prospects for future growth, or may result in the termination of the Teoxane Agreement.\nThe Teoxane Agreement requires us to make specified annual minimum purchases of RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and to meet an annual minimum expenditure on marketing and other areas related to the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, regardless of whether our commercialization efforts are successful. If we fail to meet the annual minimum purchase amount or the annual minimum marketing spending requirements specified in the Teoxane Agreement, Teoxane has the right to terminate the Teoxane Agreement.\nIf our commercialization efforts of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are unsuccessful, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flow to comply with such minimum purchase and expenditure requirements. Our obligation to Teoxane to meet such requirements could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the 2027 Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of available cash flow to meet the minimum expenditure requirements, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to engage in strategic transactions or implement our business strategies;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nAny of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, Daxibotulinumtoxin A Topical product candidates, biosimilar product candidates or future product candidates, and Teoxane may be unable to do the same for RHA\u00ae 1 and future hyaluronic acid filler advancements. The denial or delay of any such approval, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would delay commercialization and have a material adverse effect on our potential to generate revenue, our business prospects, and our results of operations.\nTo gain approval to market a biologic product, such as DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, we must provide the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities with data that adequately demonstrate the safety, efficacy and quality of the product for the intended indication applied for in the BLA, or other respective marketing applications. Teoxane must do the same with its PMAs to the FDA for the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products. The development of such products is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 development, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, findings made while clinical trials were underway, safety or efficacy observations, including previously unreported adverse events; and the need to conduct further supportive or unanticipated studies, even after initiating Phase 3 trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful or that additional supportive studies will not be required, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct.\nFor example, we completed DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical clinical trials for the treatment of \u201ccrow\u2019s feet and primary axillary hyperhidrosis but discontinued further clinical development in 2016 following the results from our REALISE 1 Phase 3 clinical trial for crow\u2019s feet. In addition, in November 2020, we released topline results from Phase 2 study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the management of plantar fasciitis. The results of this study did demonstrate pain relief on the NPRS that was numerically greater from baseline than placebo. However, neither dose used in the study met the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo. As a result, we are not currently pursuing the plantar fasciitis indication, and we will focus our efforts on indications for muscle movement and pain disorder indications where the use of neuromodulators is well-established.\nFurther, obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates or the completion of our clinical trials may be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in November 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on our BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines because it was unable to conduct the required site inspection of our manufacturing facility due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March 2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 environment. In June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete enrollment in the study in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial and we plan to complete the Phase 2 study in the first quarter of 2021 with 83 subjects enrolled. Delays in the completion of clinical trials could also delay regulatory submissions and as a result, regulatory approvals.\nOur business currently depends substantially on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Of the large number of drugs, including biologics, and medical devices in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. Currently, the only products for which we have the rights to commercialize and that have been approved for sale by the applicable regulatory authorities are the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nWe may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or future rights to commercialize RHA\u00ae 1 or any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution\nof drug, biologic and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our biologic product candidates, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products, such as RHA\u00ae 1 or future advancements developed by Teoxane, or future product candidates, in the U.S. until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. We are also not permitted to market the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for additional indications for use unless and until Teoxane receives approval of a PMA supplement for such new indication for use. We are also not permitted to market our product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities of such countries.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory body can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory body that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates are safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022Teoxane\u2019s inability to satisfy FDA approval requirements with respect to the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate proof of concept of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or other products in new indications;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate that clinical and other benefits of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, or any future product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities, or the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u2022the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFurther, interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other applicable local or foreign regulatory agencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the review and approval timelines for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates, including the BLA approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the treatment of glabellar lines.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates, the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, or any\nfuture product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. The requirement to conduct additional clinical trials or our inability to obtain the requested label or indication could increase our expenses or limit our ability to generate revenue.\nAll of the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products and any of our approved products and product candidates in the future will be subject to ongoing FDA and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review.\nWe and any third-party contract development and manufacturers or suppliers are required to comply with applicable cGMP regulations and other international regulatory requirements. The regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and quality control/quality assurance activities. Manufacturers and suppliers of materials must be named in a BLA submitted to the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval. The RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are subject to the FDA\u2019s QSR for medical devices. Additionally, third party manufacturers and suppliers and any manufacturing facility must undergo a pre-approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates. Even after a manufacturer has been qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with cGMP and QSR, as applicable. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the FDA following initial approval. Further, to the extent that we contract with third parties for the supply and/or manufacture of our products (for example, Teoxane with respect to the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and ABPS with respect to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection), our ability to control third-party compliance with FDA requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection.\nIf, as a result of the FDA\u2019s inspections, it determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may not approve the product or may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the suppliers for our product candidates are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we might be unable to ship our approved product for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. Significant and costly delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution, any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price. As such, any failure of Teoxane to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards for RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, prevent the import and/or export of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, cause the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to be recalled or withdrawn and prevent us from successfully commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post-marketing follow-up studies, which may be costly. Product approvals, once granted, may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or commercial use. As a result, limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims, or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after approval and commercialization.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain the necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our neuromodulator product candidates. Our clinical programs for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar will require substantial additional funds to complete. In connection with the Teoxane Agreement, we must make specified annual minimum purchases of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and meet an annual minimum expenditures in connection with the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We have incurred substantial transaction expenses in order to complete the HintMD Acquisition and expect to incur additional expenses in connection with combining our business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures\nwith those of HintMD. Further, to grow the HintMD platform business, we must develop features, products and services that reflect the changing nature of payments processing software and continually modify and enhance the HintMD platform to keep pace with changes in updated hardware, software, communications and database technologies and standards. In addition, we have dedicated manufacturing capacity, buyback obligations and related minimum purchase obligations under the ABPS Services Agreement in connection with the manufacture and supply of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital surplus of $389.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion. Our recorded net losses were $282.1 million, $159.4 million and $142.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common stock and the 2027 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $436.5 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future for (i) the continued sales and marketing of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers; (ii) the potential commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the treatment of glabellar lines, if approved; (iii) the clinical development of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar and development of any other indications and product candidates that we may choose to pursue; (iv) the integration of HintMD into our business and to grow the HintMD platform business; and (v) the continued build-out of our sales and marketing functions. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and supply, marketing, selling and commercialization, and product development for the HintMD platform. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise from remote working arrangements for our employees or disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, because the outcome of any clinical trial is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future product candidates. In addition, we have formed strategic collaborations, licensing and similar arrangements with third parties, such as the Teoxane Agreement, the Viatris Collaboration and the Fosun License Agreement. Although we believe these partnerships can complement or support our product offering strategy, we will continue to incur expense associated with these partnerships, including specified annual minimum purchases and expenditures and expense associated with purchases of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and research and development pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement; milestone payments in connection with the Fosun License Agreement, and cost-sharing arrangements with Viatris in connection with the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-K. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional capital sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chain, end user demand for our products, commercialization efforts, business operations, clinical trials and other aspects of our business, including a delay in the FDA\u2019s approval of the BLA, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022disruptions to the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs, physician customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022future global financial crises and economic downturns, including those caused by widespread public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022our ability to establish, maintain and grow our marketing, sales, and distribution functions;\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and preclinical studies and clinical trials of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates;\n\u2022the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates;\n\u2022the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing and conducting preclinical and clinical trials of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates;\n\u2022the cost of commercialization activities if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates, including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, or any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize and maintaining our related facilities;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements including the Viatris Collaboration, Fosun Licensing Agreement, and the terms of and timing such arrangements;\n\u2022the degree and rate of market acceptance of any future approved products;\n\u2022the emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing products or treatments;\n\u2022our ability to increase market acceptance and adoption of and to generate revenues from the HintMD platform;\n\u2022the integration costs associated with the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n\u2022the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022any litigation, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any.\nAdditional capital may not be available when needed, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to terminate or delay preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development activities for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar and any future product candidates and delay the complete integration of HintMD and the development and commercialization of the HintMD platform, or scale back the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our services and product candidates, if we obtain marketing approval.\nIf we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures or specified financial ratios, any of which could restrict our ability to commercialize our product candidates or operate as a business.\nOur product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion. In addition, our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, which could reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity.\nWe expect to enter highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device markets if our product candidates are approved. Successful competitors in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets have the ability to efficiently and effectively discover therapies, obtain patents, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, and effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. Numerous companies are engaged in developing, patenting, manufacturing and marketing healthcare products which we expect will compete with our products. Many of these competitors are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, testing, personnel and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nUpon marketing approval, the first expected use of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar will be in aesthetic medicine. Competition in aesthetic products is significant and dynamic and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations, and our competitors include large, fully-integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology and medical device companies. We anticipate that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, will face significant competition from existing injectable neuromodulators as well as unapproved and off-label treatments. Further, if approved, in the future we may face competition for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection from biosimilar products and products based upon botulinum toxin. In addition, the only products we are currently commercializing are the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. It is possible that competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are safer, more effective, more convenient or that have a lower cost of goods and price than those used in DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, or the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and in our product candidates or products being developed by us, or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition could also result in reduced profit margins and limited sales, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are significantly more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in a number of foreign countries than are approved for use in the U.S. There are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors in certain countries can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them.\nWe currently make our DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection clinical drug product exclusively in one internal manufacturing facility. We plan to utilize internal and external facilities, including through one or more third-party contractors, in the future to support commercial production if our product candidates are approved. If these or any future facility or our equipment were damaged or destroyed, or if we experience a significant disruption in our operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business would be materially harmed.\nWe currently manufacture our own clinical drug product to support DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection development in one internal manufacturing facility. In March 2017, we entered into the ABPS Services Agreement with ABPS, a contract development and manufacturing organization. Under the ABPS Services Agreement, ABPS will provide us commercial fill/finish services and will serve as a second source of manufacturing for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. The ABPS Services Agreement was amended in December 2020 to, among other things, modify ABPS\u2019s dedicated manufacturing capacity and buyback obligations and our related payment obligations for our neuromodulator products, including minimum\npurchase obligations, as well as provisions relating to the cancellation of product batches and the termination of the ABPS Services Agreement. We plan to utilize our internal and external ABPS facility to support commercial production of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. If these or any future facility were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages, actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises, or otherwise, or if performance of such manufacturing facilities is disrupted for any other reason, such an event could delay our clinical trials or, if our product candidates are approved, jeopardize our ability to manufacture our products as promptly as our customers expect or at all. As the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our manufacturing operations or on ABPS\u2019s ability to provide commercial fill/finish services and serve as a second source of manufacturing for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. If we experience delays in achieving our development objectives, or if we are unable to manufacture an approved product within a timeframe that meets our customers\u2019 expectations, our business, prospects, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. In January 2020, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement pursuant to which we obtained the right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products in the U.S., its territories and possessions. We have only had limited commercial sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and aside from our rights to the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, we only have one product candidate in clinical trials, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nBiotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in 2002. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry. We have only made limited sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers since the initial product launch in September 2020 and have not demonstrated the ability to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers over the long-term. To date, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates or generated any revenue from product sales relating to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials and operations, and expect to incur substantial expenses in building out our sales, marketing and distribution function as we pursue commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. In addition, prior to the HintMD Acquisition, HintMD incurred a net loss in each year since its inception. We may have difficulties entering the payments industry and integrating new technologies in which we have no direct prior experience. We expect to incur significant expense developing the HintMD platform and growing business of the HintMD platform.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital surplus of $389.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion. Our recorded net losses were $282.1 million, $159.4 million and $142.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common stock and the 2027 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $436.5 million. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common stock and the 2027 Notes. Our capital requirements to implement our business strategy are substantial, including our capital requirements to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. We believe that our currently available capital is sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-K.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate that these losses will increase as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, and continue to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. Our ability to achieve revenue and profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and manufacture, market and commercialize our products successfully, and increase market acceptance and adoption of and generate revenues from the HintMD platform. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing the committed activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Furthermore, final results may differ from interim results. For example, any positive results generated to date in clinical trials for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection do not ensure that later clinical trials, including any DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection clinical trials for the treatment of glabellar lines, will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety profile and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials.\nA number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials. We have suffered similar setbacks with the clinical development of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical and for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the management of plantar fasciitis, and we cannot be certain that we will not face other similar setbacks in the future for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in other indications or other clinical development programs. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials, and we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of subjects on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March 2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 environment. In June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete enrollment in the JUNIPER trial. We completed the JUNIPER trial in February of 2021 with 83 subjects enrolled. The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial achieved one co-primary endpoint, which evaluated the change in the MAS score from baseline, with demonstration of a statistically significant treatment benefit in the 500 unit treatment group compared with placebo. Statistical significance was not achieved on the second co-primary endpoint, however numerical improvement compared with placebo in all three doses on the PGIC assessment was achieved. Although we believe the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial provided sufficient data to inform our dosing strategy and design for a successful Phase 3 program, we cannot guarantee that the results of the Phase 3 program will generate positive results.\nClinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u2022obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022obtain IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022recruit suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u2022have subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022ensure clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u2022address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nSubject enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, failure of inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, discovery of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, risks related to conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nIf we experience delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of these product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe have not yet manufactured DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or any other product candidates at full commercial scale. If any of these product candidates are approved, we will face certain risks associated with scaling up our manufacturing capabilities to support commercial production.\nWe have developed an integrated manufacturing, research and development facility located at our Newark, California office. We manufacture drug substance and finished dose forms of the drug product at this facility that we use for research and development purposes and clinical trials. We have not yet manufactured DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or any other product candidates at commercial scale. If any of our product candidates are approved, we may need to expand our manufacturing facilities, add manufacturing personnel and ensure that validated processes are consistently implemented in our facilities and potentially enter into additional relationships with third-party manufacturers. The upgrade and expansion of our facilities will require additional regulatory approvals. In addition, it will be costly and time-consuming to expand our facilities and recruit necessary additional personnel. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing facilities in compliance with regulatory requirements or to hire additional necessary manufacturing personnel, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our research, development and commercialization objectives, including obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates, which could materially damage our business and financial position.\nWe rely on Teoxane for the manufacture and supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, and our dependence on Teoxane may impair our ability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nPursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, we are not entitled to manufacture the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. Instead, Teoxane is responsible for supplying all of our requirements for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. If Teoxane were to cease production or otherwise fail to timely supply us with an adequate supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, our ability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers would be adversely affected. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by Teoxane, as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result, the initial product launch of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization strategy.\nTeoxane is required to produce the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers under QSR in order to meet acceptable standards for commercial sale. If such standards change, the ability of Teoxane to produce the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers on the schedule we require to meet commercialization goals may be affected. Teoxane is subject to pre-approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with QSR and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over Teoxane\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. Any difficulties or delays in Teoxane\u2019s manufacturing and supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any failure of Teoxane to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, prevent the import and/or export of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, or cause the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to be the subject of field alerts, recalls or market withdrawals.\nWe currently contract with third-party manufacturers for certain components and services necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and expect to continue to do so to support further clinical trials and commercial scale production if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is approved. This increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers for certain components such as bulk peptide and services such as fill/finish services, necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for our clinical trials, and we expect to continue to rely on these or other manufacturers to support our commercial requirements if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is approved. In particular, in March 2017, we entered into the ABPS Services Agreement, which we amended in December 2020. We plan to utilize our internal and external ABPS facility to support commercial production of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. Some of our contracts with these manufacturers, including the ABPS Services Agreement, contain minimum order and pricing provisions and provide for early termination based on regulatory approval milestones.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including the reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party, and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. In addition, third- party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP or QSR, or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S. Our failure or the failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any other product candidates or products that we may develop. Any failure or refusal to supply the components or services for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other product candidates or products that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for the raw materials necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, and any other product candidates. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with these raw materials, could negatively affect our business.\nWe and our manufacturers purchase the materials necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for our clinical trials from single-source third-party suppliers. There are a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates, and we may need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. In particular, we outsource the manufacture of bulk peptide through an agreement with a single supplier.\nWe do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of raw materials by our manufacturers. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe that we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial and while we have taken steps to ensure we are sufficiently scaled to support expected future commercial demands, any significant delay in the supply of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party supplier could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates. If we or our manufacturers are unable to purchase these\nraw materials on acceptable terms and at sufficient quality levels or in adequate quantities if at all, the development of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future product candidates, or the commercial launch of any approved products, would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to meet our development objectives for our product candidates or generate revenues from the sale of any approved products.\nFurthermore, if there is a disruption to our or our third-party suppliers\u2019 relevant operations, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will have no other means of producing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates until they restore the affected facilities or we or they procure alternative facilities. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our or our third party or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture our product candidates on a timely basis.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate office that houses the majority of our workforce and other facilities, including our internal manufacturing facility, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has experienced severe earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our offices or facilities or that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our manufacturing facility, enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. In particular, because we manufacture botulinum toxin in our facilities, we would be required to obtain further clearance and approval by state, federal or other applicable authorities to continue or resume manufacturing activities. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, thereby increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently rely on third parties and consultants to conduct all of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties or consultants do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae 1 or any hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as CROs and clinical data management organizations, to conduct clinical trials on our product candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with GCPs and good laboratory practices for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical and preclinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We also rely on consultants to assist in the execution, including data collection and analysis, of our clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may\nalso have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of a material breach by us that is not cured within 30 days. Many of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances, including our insolvency or our failure to comply with applicable laws. In general, these agreements require such third parties to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of services of such third parties under the agreements. If the third parties or consultants conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials or enter into new arrangements, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. We may be unable to recover unused funds from these third-parties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approval for, and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses for our products that are approved for marketing, including the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved for marketing, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, significant fines, penalties, and sanctions, product liability claims, and our image and reputation within the industry and marketplace could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about regulated products, such as the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may receive warning letters, become subject to significant liability and be subject to FDA prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, which could affect our reputation within the industry and materially harm our business. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nPhysicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. However, physicians may also misuse the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or our other products, or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to product liability claims. If these products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. Furthermore, the use of these products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nAny of these events could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to third-party reimbursement policies which, if not favorable for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, could hinder or prevent their commercial success.\nOur ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications such as cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity or migraine will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products have been approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not obtain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or\nany future product candidates for therapeutic indications, or we may be required to sell them at a discount. Third party payor coverage and reimbursement will not likely be available for our products developed for aesthetic indications.\nWe expect that third-party payors will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in determining whether to approve reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications and at what level. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S.; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may not be available for certain of our product candidates. As a result, the coverage determination process will likely be a time-consuming and costly process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Our business could also be adversely affected if third-party payors limit the indications for which DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection will be reimbursed to a smaller patient set than we believe they are effective in treating.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, to other available therapies. If reimbursement for our product is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of any future products we develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits as a result of commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and as a result of the clinical testing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or any other product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates or products we develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants or cancellation of clinical trials;\n\u2022costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022regulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022an increase in product liability insurance premiums or an inability to maintain product liability insurance coverage; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other products we develop.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If and when we obtain approval for marketing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection as applicable; however, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action and stockholder derivative actions. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, the target of securities class actions or stockholder derivative claims. On May 1, 2015, a securities class action complaint was filed on behalf of the City of Warren Police and Fire Retirement System against us and certain of our directors and executive officers at the time of our follow-on public offering, and the investment banking firms that acted as the underwriters in our follow-on public offering. The Court granted final approval of the settlement, as set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement, on July 28, 2017. While the litigation has ended, we may be subject to future securities class action and shareholder derivation actions, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows and divert management\u2019s time and attention from the business.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and the continued clinical testing and potential approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of neuromodulator products for both aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and may explore strategic collaborations for the development or acquisition of new products.\nEven if we identify an appropriate collaboration or product acquisition, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the collaboration or acquisition, or effectively integrating the collaboration or acquired product into our existing business and operations. Moreover, we may not be able to pursue such opportunities if they fall within the non-compete provision of the Teoxane Agreement, which prohibits us from developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, detailing or promoting any cross-linked hyaluronic acid dermal filler (other than the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers) in the U.S. during the term of the Teoxane Agreement. We have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating products and technologies into our business and operations, and even if we are able to consummate an acquisition or other investment, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments. We may face risks, uncertainties and disruptions, including difficulties in the integration of the operations and services of these acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate collaborations, assets, products or technologies that we enter into or acquire, or if we fail to successfully exploit acquired product distribution rights and maintain acquired relationships with customers, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in connection with proposed collaborations or to pay for any product acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Identifying, contemplating, negotiating or completing a collaboration or product acquisition and integrating an acquired product or technology could significantly divert management and employee time and resources.\nWhile DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is in the clinical development stage, our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar and all of our other potential product candidates remain in the discovery or preclinical stage. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022a product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable; and\n\u2022intellectual property rights of third parties may potentially block our entry into certain geographies or make such entry economically impracticable.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to problems that we encounter in commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and in developing and commercializing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur sales, marketing, research and development and manufacturing activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including botulinum toxin type A, a key component of our product candidates, and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We are licensed with the CDC and with the California Department of Health, Food and Drug Branch for use of botulinum toxin and to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the finished product in topical and injectable dose forms. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\nWe may use third-party collaborators to help us develop, validate or commercialize any new product candidates, and our ability to commercialize such product candidates could be impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful.\nWe may continue to license or selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development, validation and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, hyaluronic acid filler products, and any future product candidates. For instance, in February 2018, we and Viatris entered into the Viatris Collaboration, as amended in August 2019, pursuant to which we and Viatris are collaborating exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. In December 2018, we and Fosun entered into the Fosun License Agreement pursuant to which we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. In addition, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement in January 2020, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products in the U.S., its territories and possessions. In any third-party collaboration, we are dependent upon the success of the collaborators to perform their responsibilities with continued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development, validation and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us.\nDisputes with our collaborators could also impair our reputation or result in development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses. Our collaboration with Viatris is for the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which is subject to risks inherent with the relatively short history of biosimilar product approvals in the U.S. In February 2019, we and Viatris participated in a BIAM with the FDA to discuss the feasibility of a 351(k) onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar submission and the necessary development pathway for an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. While we believe that such a pathway is viable, the successful development and commercialization of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product in any indications of BOTOX\u00ae or BOTOX Cosmetic\u00ae would be subject to FDA requirements that would need to be assessed by us and Viatris in determining the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. Even if successfully developed, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product would be subject to similar commercial risks as our DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could materially adversely affect our business, our reputation, our customer relationships, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personally identifiable information (\u201cpersonal information\u201d). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience unauthorized, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure of, or access to, data, systems, networks, infrastructure and facilities (\u201csecurity breaches\u201d) that may remain undetected for extended periods of time. Security breaches can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, the recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other security measures that we have integrated into our systems, the HintMD platform, systems, networks, and physical facilities, which are designed to protect against, detect and minimize security breaches, may not be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption, system failure, data access, data loss or other types of security breach. Third parties may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to,\nplatforms, systems, networks and/or physical facilities used by our vendors. In addition, our work from home policy implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions. U.S. and international authorities have been warning businesses of increased cybersecurity threats from actors seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such security breaches could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, our HintMD platform operates in an industry that is prone to cyber-attacks and the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches, which could lead to the loss of our or our customers\u2019 data, confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss or compromise to the integrity of clinical study data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, where cardholder data is compromised, HintMD might be responsible for payment network fines levied pursuant to payment network rules and regulations.\nMoreover, if a security breach affects our systems, corrupts our data or results in the unauthorized disclosure or release of personal information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, federal, state and local governments and agencies in the United States and many countries around the world, including the member states of the EEA, have adopted laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, adaptation, alteration, combination, maintenance, recording, organization, structuring, storage, retrieval, consultation, disclosure, protection, restriction, erasure, destruction and the performance of other operations (collectively the \u201cprocessing\u201d) of personal information of individuals (including patients, consumers, employees, and professionals) who reside in the United States and these other countries (generally, \u201cprivacy laws\u201d). Additionally, United States and foreign laws and regulations, including laws in every U.S. state, and laws in the member states of the EEA, may require notification to governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, credit reporting agencies, the media, or individual data subjects, in the event the company suffers a security breach that exposes personal information processed by or on behalf of the company (\u201cbreach notification laws\u201d). For example, privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by HIPAA, U.S. state data breach notification laws, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d) together with implementing or supplementary legislation of member states of the EEA all have significant obligations with respect to processing personal information, as well as obligations related to notifications in the event of certain unauthorized disclosures, access, loss, alteration or destruction of personal information.\nIn the event of a security breach affecting personal information we could also be exposed, pursuant to these privacy laws and breach notification laws, to a risk of financial loss, regulatory enforcement measures, penalties, and fines, as well as third-party indemnification claims or litigation, and potential civil or criminal liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, unauthorized access to the HintMD platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities, could result in litigation with HintMD customers, HintMD customers\u2019 end-users, or other relevant stakeholders. Any of these proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management\u2019s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation and the reputation of the HintMD platform. We could be required to fundamentally change the business activities and practices of the HintMD platform or modify its products and/or platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If a security breach were to occur, and the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data or the data of our or HintMD\u2019s customers or its customers\u2019 end-users was disrupted, we could incur significant liability, or the HintMD platform, systems or networks may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation. Any of the foregoing circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our business and its results of operations as a result.\nIn addition to the obligations arising from the breach notification laws, we also have contractual and legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders, including certain customers and partners, of security breaches. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach. A security breach may result in a breach of HintMD customer contracts or agreements with third party service providers. Our agreements with certain customers or third party service providers may require us to use industry-standard, reasonable measures, or measures otherwise mandated by law to safeguard personal information or confidential information. A security breach could lead to claims by our customers, their end-users, or other relevant stakeholders that we have failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations. As a result, we could be subject to legal action or our customers or third party service providers could end their relationships with the HintMD platform. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages.\nChanges in and failures to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy laws and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nAs stated above, we are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign privacy laws, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the processing of personal information, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad. This global privacy law and regulatory guidance landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our vendors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use, share and otherwise process personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability, or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign privacy laws, our internal policies and procedures, or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort, and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the U.S., HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards and obligations on covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates and their subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. We may become subject to new privacy laws or cybersecurity regulations. Such laws and regulations could affect our ability to process personal information (in particular, our ability to use certain data for purposes such as risk or fraud avoidance, marketing or advertising), our ability to control our costs by using certain vendors or service providers, or impact our ability to offer certain services in certain jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective on January 1, 2020 and its applicable regulations are being implemented in waves by the California Attorney General, including additional regulations that were still in the comment phase at the end of 2020 (collectively the Act and its regulations, \u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. As we expand our operations, the CCPA will likely impact our business activities and may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. If we fail to comply with the CCPA, including all of the various and recent waves of its implementing regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws, and some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners.\nBecause data security is a critical competitive factor in the payments processing industry, there are statements in the HintMD platform privacy policies and terms of service, its certifications to privacy standards, and its marketing materials, describing the security of the HintMD platform, including descriptions of certain security measures it employs. Should any of these statements be untrue, become untrue, or be perceived to be untrue, even if through circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state, local regulators or private litigants. In the event that we are subject to HIPAA, the CCPA, or other U.S. privacy laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy laws with which we, our customers, and our vendors must comply. For example, member states of the EEA have adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of data subjects in the EEA, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has increased compliance burdens on us, including by requiring the following: establishing a legal basis for processing personal information; creating obligations for controllers and processors to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects for controllers (including presentation of certain information in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form about how their personal information is used and their rights vis-\u00e0-vis that data and its use); introducing the obligation to carry out so-called data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; establishing limitations on collection and retention of personal information through \u2018purpose,\u2019 \u2018data minimization\u2019 and \u2018storage limitation\u2019 principles; establishing obligations to implement \u2018privacy by design\u2019; introducing obligations to honor increased rights for data subjects (such as rights for individuals to be \u2018forgotten,\u2019 rights to data portability, rights to object etc. in certain circumstances); formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consent; establishing obligations to implement certain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information; introducing obligations to agree to certain specific contractual terms and to take certain measures when engaging third party processors and joint controllers; introducing the obligation to provide notice of certain significant security breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment representatives in the European Union in certain circumstances.\nThe processing of \u2018special categories of personal data\u2019, such as data concerning health, biometric data used for unique identification purposes and genetic information imposes heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in Europe by expressly expanding the definition of personal information to include \u2018pseudonymized\u2019 or key-coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. The GDPR also provides that EEA member states should make their own further laws and regulations to introduce specific requirements related to the processing of \u2018special categories of personal data,\u2019 as well as personal information related to criminal offences or convictions. This fact may lead to greater divergence on the law that applies to the processing of such data types across the EEA, compliance with which, as and where applicable, may increase our costs and could increase our overall compliance risk.\nIn addition, the GDPR provides for robust regulatory enforcement and greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws, including fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4 percent of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. In addition to administrative fines, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available to competent supervisory authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations of the GDPR, including extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order temporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal information carried out by non-compliant actors. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe had been certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") in a case known colloquially as \u201cSchrems II.\u201d Following this decision, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information\nCommissioner (the \"FDPIC\"), announced that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield does not provide adequate safeguards for the purposes of personal information transfers from Switzerland to the United States. While the FDPIC does not have authority to invalidate the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield regime, the FDPIC\u2019s announcement casts doubt on the viability of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as a future compliance mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers.\nThe CJEU\u2019s decision in Schrems II also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or other third countries that are not the subject of an adequacy decision of the European Commission. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the Standard Contractual Clauses in principle in Schrems II, it made clear that reliance on those Clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the Standard Contractual Clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular regarding applicable surveillance laws and relevant rights of individuals with respect to the transferred data. In the context of any given transfer, where the legal regime applicable in the destination country may or does conflict with the intended operation of the Standard Contractual Clauses and/or applicable European law, the decision in Schrems II and subsequent draft guidance from the European Data Protection Board, or EDPB, would require the parties to that transfer to implement certain supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures to rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses as a compliant \u2018transfer mechanism.\u2019 However, the aforementioned draft guidance from the EDPB on such supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures appears to conclude that no combination of such measures could be sufficient to allow effective reliance on the Standard Contractual Clauses in the context of transfers of personal information \u2018in the clear\u2019 to recipients in countries where the power granted to public authorities to access the transferred data goes beyond that which is \u2018necessary and proportionate in a democratic society\u2019 - which may, following the CJEU\u2019s conclusions in Schrems II on relevant powers of United States public authorities and commentary in that draft EDPB guidance, include the United States in certain circumstances (e.g., where Section 702 of the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applies). At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nAs such, if we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal information transfers from Europe, including, for example, obtaining individuals\u2019 explicit consent to transfer their personal information from Europe to the United States or other countries, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal information from Europe. Inability to import personal information from the EEA, United Kingdom or Switzerland may also restrict our clinical trials activities in Europe; limit our ability to collaborate with contract research organizations as well as other service providers, contractors and other companies subject to European data protection laws; and require us to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. The type of challenges we face in Europe will likely also arise in other jurisdictions that adopt laws similar in construction to the GDPR or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity.\nAs we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business. It is possible that the GDPR, CCPA or other laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or inconsistent with our current policies and practices and compliance with such laws and regulations could require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. We cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all such applicable data protection laws and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.\nThe relocation of our headquarters may not be executed as we envision.\nWe moved our global headquarters from Newark, California, to Nashville, Tennessee, effective January 1, 2021. In connection with this relocation, we could experience unexpected costs or business disruption and diversion of management attention, which could negatively impact our business operations and result in additional costs. The relocation may have a significant adverse effect on our ability to motivate and retain current employees. Further significant managerial and operational challenges could arise, such as ineffective transfer of institutional knowledge from current employees to newly-hired employees and we could encounter more difficulty than expected in hiring qualified employees to help staff our Nashville headquarters.\nRisks Related to the HintMD Platform\nThe HintMD platform has been installed in limited pilot accounts. If HintMD is not able to increase adoption and use of the HintMD platform and maintain and enhance the HintMD brand, then HintMD's business, operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nCustomers of the HintMD platform consist of plastic surgeons, dermatologists and medical spas, which we refer to as \u201cpractices.\u201d In order to increase revenue from the HintMD platform and market our aesthetic product portfolio through the HintMD platform, we need to expand the HintMD customer base significantly, and practices and their patients must continue to utilize the HintMD platform. If the HintMD platform is not widely adopted then our expectations for revenue growth and additional marketing opportunities from the HintMD platform will not be achieved. There is no assurance that we will be successful in increasing the use of the HintMD platform.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the HintMD reputation as a differentiated payments processing platform serving the medical aesthetic industry is critical to HintMD's relationship with existing customers and its ability to attract new customers and may also result in the generation of new aesthetic product customers for Revance. The successful promotion of HintMD\u2019s brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to target and have the HintMD platform adopted by premier accounts, to increase loyalty between practices and patients, to continue to develop high-quality software, to successfully differentiate the HintMD platform from competitive products and services, and to achieve success in sales and marketing efforts. In July 2020, Allergan terminate its alliance with HintMD through Allergan\u2019s Brilliant Distinctions\u00ae program, which may adversely impact the adoption of the HintMD platform by new practices. However, we believe that the open nature of the HintMD platform and ability to work with practices to develop their own subscription or loyalty programs that are not focused on specific manufacturers will enable HintMD to attract new customers.\nThe promotion of the HintMD platform will require us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as we seek to expand the HintMD platform. To the extent that these activities generate increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If HintMD does not successfully maintain and enhance the HintMD platform offerings, it could lose customers or fail to attract potential new customers, which would negatively affect HintMD's business, operating results and financial condition. As a result, Revance may not generate revenue from the HintMD platform, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or Revance may not realize the anticipated benefits from the HintMD Acquisition.\nThe HintMD Acquisition may result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our integration of the business and operations of HintMD. The amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known. Further, our failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities or necessary technology investments we are assuming as a result of the HintMD Acquisition could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with the HintMD platform technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe continued growth of the HintMD platform depends in part on the ability of users to access the platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. The HintMD platform is proprietary, and it relies on the expertise of members of engineering, operations and software development teams for its continued performance. In addition, we depend on external data centers, such as Amazon\u2019s AWS, to host the HintMD platform applications and have integrated third-party services that we rely upon as critical components of the HintMD application. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The HintMD platform has experienced minor disruptions, outages and performance problems in the past, and may in the future experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, delays in scaling of the technical infrastructure (such as if we\ndo not maintain enough excess capacity or accurately predict the infrastructure requirements of the HintMD platform), capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing the HintMD platform simultaneously, denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks or other security-related incidents. In some instances, HintMD may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of the HintMD platform, especially during peak usage times and as the HintMD platform becomes more complex and its user traffic increases. As a result, the HintMD platform may become unavailable or users may be unable to access the HintMD platform within a reasonable amount of time. In the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure, user data may be permanently lost. If the HintMD platform experiences significant periods of service downtime in the future, HintMD and Revance may be subject to claims by users of the HintMD platform. To the extent that HintMD and Revance do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology and efficiently resolve interruptions or performance problems with the HintMD platform, existing relationships with practices would be adversely affected and the HintMD brand could be harmed. Poor relationships with practices and reputational harm to HintMD could negatively impact Revance\u2019s brand and its relationships with aesthetic product customers.\nThe business and growth of the HintMD platform depend in part on the success of its strategic relationships with third parties, including payments partners, platform partners, technology partners and aesthetics manufacturers.\nHintMD depends on, and anticipates that it will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships in order to sustain and grow the HintMD platform. It is highly dependent upon partners for certain critical features and functionality of the HintMD platform, including secure data centers, a sponsor bank, third-party payment processors and third-party aesthetics manufacturers which have used the HintMD platform for brand loyalty programs. The inability of the HintMD platform to provide brand loyalty programs as it has in the past may adversely impact the adoption of the HintMD platform by new practices or may result in a loss of current customers. In July 2020, Allergan terminated its alliance with HintMD through Allergan\u2019s Brilliant Distinctions\u00ae program, which may have a negative impact on customer retention and adoption.\nHintMD depends on hardware providers and third-party processing partners to perform payment processing services to make the HintMD platform work. For example, it relies on Fiserv to provide the payment gateway services that enables the HintMD platform to process payments, and if Fiserv is unable to continue to supply processing for the HintMD platform, the performance of the HintMD platform system could be adversely affected and its growth would be limited. Its processing partners and suppliers may go out of business or otherwise be unable or unwilling to continue providing such services, which could significantly and materially reduce its payments revenue and disrupt its business. In addition, users of the HintMD platform may be subject to quality issues related to its third-party processing partners or it may become involved in contractual disputes with its processing partners, both of which could impact the HintMD reputation and adversely impact customer relationships and its ability to generate revenue.\nIf HintMD were no longer able to use its current third-party processing partners, it may be required to migrate to other third-party payment partners in the future. The initiation of these relationships and the transition from one relationship to another could require significant time and resources, and establishing these new relationships may be challenging. Further, any new third-party payment processing relationships may not be as effective, efficient or well received by users of the HintMD platform, nor is there any assurance that HintMD will be able to reach an agreement with such processing partners. Contracts with such processing partners may be less economically beneficial to HintMD than existing relationships. In addition, for pricing, technological or other reasons, existing customers may not agree to migrate to a new payments provider, which may reduce the HintMD customer base and decrease the profitability of the HintMD platform.\nIn addition to a third-party payment processor, another payment partner required for HintMD to act as a PayFac is an acquiring bank that is a member of the payment networks. The acquiring bank acquires and settles funds on behalf of its customers. The acquiring bank may change their underwriting criteria such that continued use of the acquiring bank would render HintMD processing services unprofitable, the acquiring bank may itself encounter difficulties unrelated to HintMD or payment network rules may be amended rendering the acquiring bank incapable of processing for HintMD customers. Any of these occurrences could interfere with the ability of the HintMD platform to secure effective and profitable payment processing services for its customers, which would disrupt the HintMD business, increase its expenses and impact the services it could provide to its customers.\nIn addition, failure of these or any of its technology providers to maintain, support or secure their technology platforms in general, and HintMD integrations in particular, or errors or defects in their technology, could materially and adversely impact HintMD\u2019s relationship with its customers, damage its reputation and brand, and harm its business. In addition, any failure by the software provided by HintMD\u2019s third party vendors may cause HintMD to fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could expose HintMD and Revance to regulatory, financial, or reputational risk. HintMD third-party partners may also suffer disruptions or weakness in their businesses, including those that require changes to their technological integration specifications or payment transaction risk management protocols, which could increase costs to HintMD to maintain compatibility, decrease sales or require HintMD to source new partners.\nIdentifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with strategic third parties requires significant time and resources. In addition, integrating third-party technology is complex, costly and time-consuming. HintMD\u2019s agreements with these partners are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with HintMD\u2019s competitors or from offering competing services. HintMD\u2019s competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce use of the HintMD platform. In addition, HintMD partners could develop competing products or services.\nIf HintMD is unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining relationships with these strategic third parties, its ability to compete in the payments marketplace could be impaired, and as a result HintMD's business, operating results and financial condition may negatively be impacted, and we may not realize the benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition in the payment processing industry may harm the HintMD business. Further, HintMD is dependent on payment card networks and third-party payment processors, and any changes to their fee structures could harm HintMD's business.\nHintMD operates in a highly competitive marketplace, which impacts the pricing HintMD may charge its customers for the processing of credit cards. There can be significant downward pricing pressure in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. HintMD's competitors may be able to offer similar or lower rates to its customers alongside a more comprehensive set of financial services products that allows them to offset a reduction in processing margins.\nAdditionally, HintMD's costs associated with the processing of credit cards are not directly under its control. HintMD's expenses related to the processing of credit cards include interchange fees, assessment fees, and other related costs payable to a third-party payment processor. From time to time, these fees have increased and may continue to do so in the future. An increase in the fee structure may adversely affect HintMD's margins and we may not realize the benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nIf the HintMD platform or its vendors\u2019 networks or computer systems are breached or if the security of the personal information that HintMD collects, stores or processes through the HintMD platform (or that its vendors collect, store or process) is compromised or otherwise experiences unauthorized access, or HintMD fails to comply with commitments and assurances regarding the privacy and security of personal information on the HintMD platform, the HintMD platform may be perceived as insecure, and HintMD may lose existing users or fail to attract new users to the HintMD platform, and the Revance brand and reputation may be negatively impacted, and HintMD and Revance may incur significant liabilities.\nUse of the HintMD platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of customers\u2019 proprietary data, including personal or identifying information regarding their patients such as name, address and the types of treatments they are receiving. As a result, unauthorized access to, security breaches of, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), employee theft or misuse, or denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks against the HintMD platform could result in the unauthorized access to or use of, disclosure of, and/or loss of, such data, as well as loss of intellectual property or trade secrets.\nIf any unauthorized access to the HintMD platform systems or data or a security breach occurs or is believed to have occurred, HintMD's reputation and brand could be damaged, which could also reflect negatively on Revance's reputation and brand. HintMD could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches or attacks and remediate its systems, and HintMD could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, and our ability to operate the HintMD platform business may be impaired. HintMD\nmay in the future experience denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks against the HintMD platform. If potential new users or existing users believe that the HintMD platform does not provide adequate security for the storage of personal information or confidential information or its transmission over the Internet, they may not adopt the HintMD platform or may choose not to renew their subscriptions to the HintMD platform, which could harm its business. Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause HintMD and Revance to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and our liability may be in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage.\nHintMD has contractual and legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. The HintMD platform operates in an industry that is prone to cyber-attacks. Failure to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks could result in the unauthorized access to our data or the data of its customers. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities and others of security breaches involving certain types of data. In addition, HintMD's agreements with certain customers and partners may require HintMD to notify them in the event of a security breach. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause HintMD customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of HintMD's security measures and require HintMD to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach. A security breach may cause HintMD to breach HintMD customer contracts. HintMD's agreements with certain customers may require it to use industry-standard, reasonable measures or measures otherwise mandated by law to safeguard personal information or confidential information. A security breach could lead to claims by HintMD customers, their end-users, or other relevant stakeholders that HintMD has failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations. HintMD also agreed contractually to comply with payment network regulations concerning security that, when violated, can result in fines payable by HintMD to payment networks. As a result, HintMD could be subject to legal action, fines, or its customers could end their relationships with the HintMD platform. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in HintMD's contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect HintMD from liabilities or damages.\nBecause data security is a critical competitive factor in the payments processing industry, there are statements in the HintMD platform privacy policies and terms of service, its certifications to privacy standards, and its marketing materials, describing the security of the HintMD platform, including descriptions of certain security measures it employs. Should any of these statements be untrue, become untrue, or be perceived to be untrue, even if through circumstances beyond HintMD's reasonable control, HintMD may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state, local regulators or private litigants.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not identified until they are launched against a target, HintMD may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. HintMD may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for extended periods of time. The recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other security measures that HintMD has integrated into the HintMD platform, systems, networks, and physical facilities, which are designed to protect against, detect and minimize security breaches, may not be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption, system failure, data access, data loss or other types of security breach. Third parties may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, systems, networks and/or physical facilities used by HintMD vendors.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches on the HintMD platform may adversely affect HintMD's business. Unauthorized access to the HintMD platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with HintMD customers, HintMD customers\u2019 end-users, or other relevant stakeholders. These proceedings could force HintMD to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management\u2019s time and attention, increase HintMD's costs of doing business, or adversely affect the reputation of the HintMD platform. HintMD could be required to fundamentally change the business activities and practices of the HintMD platform or modify its products and/or platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on HintMD's business. If a security breach were to occur, and the confidentiality, integrity or availability of HintMD data or the data of HintMD customers or its customers\u2019 end-users was disrupted, HintMD could incur significant liability, or the HintMD platform, systems or networks may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect HintMD's business and damage its reputation.\nHintMD is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Revance, and all of the HintMD operations are conducted by Revance employees. As a result, any of the foregoing circumstances may expose Revance to legal liability, regulatory action, fines,\ndamages and lawsuits, increased expenses, damage to its brand and reputation and may have a material adverse effect on Revance's business, financial results and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Human Capital Resources\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in research and development to a company involved in the commercialization of products, we will need to increase the size of our organization. If we are unable to maintain and expand sales, marketing, managerial and/or operational capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any other future product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nIn order to successfully commercialize our products, we need to expand our organization, including adding marketing, managerial, operational and sales capabilities, or contracting with third parties to provide these capabilities for us in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In August 2020, we established an approximately 100-person field sales team in the third quarter and have limited marketing and sales capabilities for the commercialization of our product candidates. To commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other future product candidates, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions we seek to enter, we must manage and further expand our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial, operational and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Effectively executing our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u2022identify recruit, train, integrate, incentivize and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team;\n\u2022achieve, maintain and grow market, physician, patient and healthcare payor acceptance of, and demand for our products;\n\u2022manage our clinical trials and manufacturing operations effectively;\n\u2022manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to Teoxane under the Teoxane Agreement and to other third parties;\n\u2022successfully integrate HintMD and realize the benefits expected from the HintMD Acquisition; and\n\u2022continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe expect to market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers through our sales force in North America, and in Europe and other countries through either our own sales force or a combination of our internal sales force and distributors or partners, and establishing these channels may be expensive and time consuming. While we believe we are creating an efficient commercial organization, we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which could cause our commercialization efforts to be unprofitable or less profitable than expected.\nWe have limited prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize\nqualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. For example, we have and may continue to experience challenges associated with recruiting field representatives virtually through remote, group interviewing platforms and with onboarding new field representatives during such times as the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates our work from home policy. Any failure to maintain adequate internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products and may result in a breach of our obligations to Teoxane under the Teoxane Agreement. We also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel, and turnover in our sales force and marketing personnel could negatively affect the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if it receives regulatory approval, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their previous research output.\nAs our operations expand, we expect that we will also need to manage additional relationships with various collaborative partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our organization, in particular on management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. Due to our limited financial resources and our limited experience in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our development and strategic objectives, or disrupt our operations.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management, we may be unable to successfully develop DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future products we develop, or grow revenue from the HintMD platform.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, scientific, technical and sales personnel. We believe that our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management, particularly Mark J. Foley, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Abhay Joshi, Ph.D., our Chief Operating Officer, President of R&D and Product Operations, Tobin C. Schilke, our Chief Financial Officer, Dustin Sjuts, our Chief Commercial Officer, Aesthetics & Therapeutics, and Aubrey Rankin, our President of Innovation and Technology, as well as our senior scientists and other members of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, the completion of our planned clinical trials, the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future products we develop, or our ability to increase adoption of the HintMD platform.\nLeadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. Resignations of executive officers may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Leadership changes may also increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees and may cause declines in the productivity of existing employees. The search for a replacement officer may take many months or more, further exacerbating these factors. Identifying and hiring an experienced and qualified executive officer are typically difficult. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations and may result in cultural differences and friction due to changes in strategy and style. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees, creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf Teoxane fails to obtain and maintain patent, licensing arrangements or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property that we have exclusive distribution rights to, we could lose our rights related to the RHA\u00ae\nCollection of dermal fillers, which would have a material adverse effect on our potential to generate revenue, our business prospects, and our results of operations.\nIf Teoxane fails to obtain and maintain patent, licensing arrangements or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property that we have exclusive distribution rights to, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. The intellectual property underlying the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to the Teoxane Agreement, including:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the Teoxane Agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of Teoxane that is not subject to the Teoxane Agreement;\n\u2022the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; and\n\u2022the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the development of intellectual property under the Teoxane Agreement.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected products or product candidates.\nIf our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates, including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, and our development programs. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thereby eroding our competitive position.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or foreign countries. Competitors and academic scientists in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and neuromodulators have created a substantial amount of prior art, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of their grant. Our European Patent EP 2 661 276 for \u201cTopical composition comprising botulinum toxin and a dye\u201d was opposed in the European Patent Office by Allergan plc on May 2, 2018, and although this patent is not material to our business, we continue to take appropriate measures to defend the patent, including an appeal of a decision to revoke the patent, which decision is suspended in view of the appeal. On May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for \u201cMethods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin\u201d was opposed. We are vigorously defending this patent in the European Patent Office. We were informed in May 2019 that our patent application NC2018/0005351 pending in Colombia for \u201cInjectable Botulinum Toxin Formulations And Methods of Use Thereof Having Long Duration of Therapeutic Effect\u201d was opposed. We have responded to this pre-grant opposition. Furthermore, even if our patents and applications are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nIn addition, the patent laws of the U.S. provide procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. Patents issued from applications filed after March 15, 2013 may be challenged by third parties using the post-grant review procedure which allows challenges for a number of reasons, including prior art, sufficiency of disclosure, and subject matter eligibility. Under the inter partes review procedure, any third party may challenge the validity of any issued U.S. Patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) on the basis of prior art patents or printed publications. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings as compared to the evidentiary standard relied on in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates is challenged, then it could threaten our ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, and could threaten our ability to prevent competitive products from being marketed. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nSince patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. Furthermore, for applications filed before March 16, 2013, or patents issuing from such applications, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications and patents. As of March 16, 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. The change to \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d from \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d is one of the changes to the patent laws of the United States resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act signed into law on September 16, 2011. Among some of the other changes to the patent laws are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO.\nEven where laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. Moreover, any actions we may bring to enforce our intellectual property against our competitors could provoke them to bring counterclaims against us, and some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios and financial resources than we have.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce and any other elements of our product development and manufacturing processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could significantly affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisers have previous employment or consulting relationships. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other confidential information.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or otherwise violate or be claimed to infringe or otherwise violate patents owned or controlled by other parties. Competitors in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and neuromodulators have developed large portfolios of patents and patent applications in fields relating to our business. For example, there are patents held by third parties that relate to the treatment with neuromodulator products for indications we are currently developing. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, during the pendency of the litigation, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product based on our current or future indications, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference, derivation or post-grant proceedings declared or granted by the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign countries, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe upon our intellectual property, including our patents or the patents of our licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use of our own or licensed intellectual property. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied.\nAn adverse determination of any litigation or other proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference, derivation, inter partes review, post-grant review or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors or collaborators. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, either alone or with our licensors or collaborators, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceeding. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceeding, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. and in some cases may even force us to grant a compulsory license to competitors or other third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIn addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in domestic and foreign intellectual property laws.\nUse of \u201copen source\u201d software for the HintMD platform could adversely affect HintMD's ability to provide the HintMD platform and subject HintMD and Revance to possible claims.\nThe HintMD platform incorporates open source software and we expect to continue to use open source software in the future. HintMD and Revance may face claims from others claiming ownership of open source software, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software or derivative works thereof, or of HintMD's proprietary source code associated with such open source software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change the HintMD platform, any of which would have a negative effect on HintMD's and Revance's business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software HintMD utilizes change, HintMD and Revance may be forced to reengineer the HintMD platform or incur additional costs. Although we have implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into the HintMD platform, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in the HintMD platform in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies.\nAny failure to protect intellectual property rights associated with the HintMD platform could impair our ability to protect HintMD's proprietary technology and the HintMD brand.\nHintMD currently has four issued patents and two pending patent applications. However, there is no guarantee that the pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or that the issued patents will ultimately be determined to be valid and enforceable. HintMD also has one registered trademark in the United States and one pending trademark in Canada. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or other\nprotective agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect HintMD's intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect HintMD intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent others from competing with the HintMD platform.\nTo protect HintMD\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor, protect and enforce these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce HintMD\u2019s intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of HintMD\u2019s intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce the HintMD intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of the HintMD intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce the HintMD intellectual property rights could adversely affect the HintMD brand and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Government and Industry Regulation\nOur business and products are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the CDC, and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and Controlled Substances Act, may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nAfter our other products receive regulatory approval, we, and our direct and indirect suppliers, will remain subject to the periodic inspection of our plants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in the implementation of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies programs, completion of government mandated clinical trials, and government enforcement action relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing manufacturing controls noted above.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, may limit or delay regulatory approval and may subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any approved product will be subject to continual regulatory review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, including labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our collaborators receive for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae 1 dermal filler or any future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the applicable regulatory agency approves DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae 1 dermal filler or any future product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and GCPs for any clinical trials conducted post-approval. The RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are currently subject to such extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, reports, registration and continued compliance. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur ongoing regulatory requirements may also change from time to time, potentially harming or making costlier our commercialization efforts. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or other countries. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, we will be unable to market our products outside of the U.S.\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, or the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file, we may not receive the necessary approvals to commercialize our products in geographies outside of the U.S.\nFurther, interruption or delays in the operations of applicable foreign regulatory agencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the review and approval timelines of such agencies for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates.\nThe RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other products, may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nAs we commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and if we are successful in commercializing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other products, including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nThe HintMD platform is subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security. Because the HintMD platform can be used to collect and store personal information, domestic privacy and data security concerns could result in HintMD and Revance incurring additional costs and liabilities or inhibit sales of the HintMD platform.\nPractices use the HintMD platform to process personal information, including personal information that could be considered \u201csensitive\u201d, regarding patients, which processing is subject to U.S. federal and state privacy laws and breach notification laws. The costs of compliance with these privacy laws and breach notification laws, as well as the associated burdens imposed by such laws, may limit the use or adoption of the HintMD platform, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities related to noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales of the HintMD platform, any of which could harm HintMD's and Revance's business. See \"If the HintMD platform or its vendors\u2019 networks or computer systems are breached or if the security of the personal information that HintMD collects, stores or processes through the HintMD platform (or that its vendors collect, store or process) is compromised or otherwise experiences unauthorized access, or HintMD fails to comply with commitments and assurances regarding the privacy and security of personal information on the HintMD platform, the HintMD platform may be perceived as insecure, and HintMD may lose existing users or fail to attract new users to the HintMD platform, and the Revance brand and reputation may be negatively impacted, and HintMD and Revance may incur significant liabilities.\"\nAny failure by HintMD vendors to comply with the terms of HintMD's contractual provisions or the applicable privacy or breach notification laws or where applicable the PCI DSS could result in proceedings against HintMD and Revance by governmental entities or others.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new federal and state privacy laws passed that directly impact the HintMD platform, and we may not be able to predict the full impact that such future laws may have on our business. For instance, if our privacy and data policies and practices with respect to the HintMD platform, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient to demonstrate compliance with existing or new privacy laws, our risk and cost of operation could increase and user demand for the HintMD platform could decline, and our business could be harmed.\nThe HintMD platform may in certain circumstances, process information that could be defined by HIPAA as \u201cprotected health information\u201d (also called \u201cPHI\u201d) and thus such processing may be subject to HIPAA. Additionally, certain states have adopted health information privacy laws and regulations related to the processing of PHI and comparable to HIPAA, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Generally, HIPAA and state health information privacy laws require entities directly regulated by the law and regulations (HIPAA calls these entities \u201ccovered entities\u201d, and their service providers and subcontractors \u201cbusiness associates\u201d) to develop and maintain certain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. In the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI, the reporting requirements could include notification to affected individuals, state and federal governmental agencies, and in certain instances the media. Depending on the facts and circumstances we could be subject to significant civil and administrative penalties, and in rare circumstances, criminal penalties, if we obtain, use, or disclose PHI through the HintMD platform in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or state health information privacy laws. Further, if we are not able to meet our obligations under HIPAA and/or applicable state health information privacy laws relating to the HintMD platform, HintMD could be found to have breached its contractual obligations with its customers. Maintaining compliance with applicable privacy laws and our contractual obligations is a complex undertaking, and we cannot be certain how these health information privacy laws will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.\nAdditionally, the HintMD platform processes a significant portion of its payments through credit or debit cards and enables users of its payments platform to engage in payments through its service. HintMD, and as a result, Revance operations related to the HintMD platform, are contractually required to maintain compliance with current PCI DSS as part of our information security program and to undergo periodic PCI DSS audits undertaken by third party auditors (\u201cPCI Audits\u201d). We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data. If we cannot comply with or if we incur a violation of any of these standards or contractual requirements, or if we have findings resulting from a PCI Audit and we fail to undertake timely corrective action, we could incur significant liability through fines and penalties imposed by credit card associations or other organizations or litigation with relevant stakeholders, either of which could have an adverse effect on the reputation, business, financial condition and operating results of HintMD and Revance. In addition, failure to comply with the PCI DSS obligations or HintMD's\ncontractual obligations, including timely and sufficient mitigation of any findings from a PCI Audit, could also result in the termination of HintMD\u2019s status as a registered PayFac, thereby dramatically impairing HintMD's ability to continue doing business in the payments industry, or HintMD could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their costs of issuing new cards and related expenses.\nWe may find it necessary to change our business practices or expend significant resources to modify the HintMD software or platform to adapt to audit findings, new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning these matters. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all. Any failure to comply with federal, state or local laws and regulations, industry standards or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity for HintMD and Revance and could cause users of the HintMD platform, patients undergoing Revance's clinical trials or customers of Revance to lose trust in HintMD and Revance, which could have an adverse effect on the reputation and business of HintMD and Revance.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nWhile we do not expect that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved for the treatment of glabellar lines, or the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to subject us to all of the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse, we may be subject to, or in the future become subject to, additional laws in connection with the use of these products for treatment of therapeutic indications or any future product candidates. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors.\nThe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the FCA impose liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The FCA includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims.\nHIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nHIPAA also imposes, among other things, certain standards and obligations on covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates and subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, covered manufacturers will also be required to report annually regarding payments and other transfers of value\nprovided in the previous year to certain other healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives and report ownership or investment interests held by such healthcare professionals and their immediate family members.\nWe may also be subject to analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities, and state and local laws that require the registration of our pharmaceutical sales representatives.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted pharmaceutical manufacturers for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes for a range of activities, such as those based on improper research or consulting contracts with physicians and other healthcare professionals, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our activities such as contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, including any HintMD rewards programs, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nAlso, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the U.S. may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, topical, or any future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if clearance or approval is obtained, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and our other products.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the ACA was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the former U.S. presidential administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the former U.S. presidential administration signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District\nCourt ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020, and heard oral arguments on the case on November 10, 2020, and the case is expected to be decided sometime in 2021. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.\nIn addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals, which have resulted in additional regulations from the FDA, CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, in November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. This interim final rule is subject to challenge. The likelihood of implementation of any of the other former U.S. presidential administration's reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of, or affect the price that we may charge for, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs on our commercialization efforts for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could require, among other things:\n\u2022changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022recall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u2022additional recordkeeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain licenses and other authorizations to enable use to act as a distributor of Teoxane\u2019s RHA\u00ae dermal fillers or comply with such licensing requirements could result in fines or other penalties.\nAs the distributor of Teoxane\u2019s RHA\u00ae dermal fillers, we will be required to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals or other types of state and local permissions in order to comply with various regulations regarding the distribution of medical devices, and must cooperate with Teoxane in the event of any medical device reports (adverse events) or product recalls. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements may take many months, and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of licenses, registrations or accreditations, and can also subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive relief and/or criminal penalties. Failure to obtain state\nregulatory approval will also prevent distribution of products where such approval is necessary and will limit our ability to generate revenue. As we have no prior experience in the distribution of medical devices, it will take time and expense to build the necessary compliance infrastructure to support these activities.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nThe HintMD platform is subject to extensive regulation and industry compliance requirements associated with operating as a PayFac, and its failure to comply with such regulation and requirements could negatively impact the business of HintMD and Revance.\nThe financial services offered by HintMD as a PayFac are subject to legal, regulatory, and card brand requirements, including those regarding anti-money laundering, sanctions, fraud, and consumer financial protection. All HintMD operations are conducted by certain Revance employees, and, as a result, those employees and the operations of Revance as it relates to the HintMD platform will be subject to these regulations and requirements. Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in: civil or criminal penalties that could increase our expenses and adversely impact our business operations; the termination of HintMD\u2019s key supplier agreements, such as its Payment Facilitator Agreement; assessment of significant fines or monetary penalties; damage to HintMD\u2019s and Revance's brand and reputation; loss of HintMD customers, and poor financial performance for Revance. In addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in interpretations and enforcement practices may in turn require increased operating costs or capital expenditures to implement operational changes. Unforeseen regulatory changes may also limit HintMD\u2019s ability to offer certain products or services, or impact the competitiveness of products or services it offers. If HintMD is no longer able to offer the full suite of its services or expand its services to appeal to a larger consumer base, the HintMD brand and reputation may be harmed, customer retention and procurement may be negatively impacted, Revance may have to alter its commercialization strategy and Revance may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our 2027 Notes\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness, including the 2027 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including global macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2027 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2027 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2027 Notes.\nHolders of the 2027 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2027 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the 2027 Notes) at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2027 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2027 Notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2027 Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2027 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2027 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2027 Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2027 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes is triggered, holders of 2027 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2027 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2027 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2027 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2027 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the 2027 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2027 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2027 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2027 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2027 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock markets in general and the markets for pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that may have been for reasons that are related or unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022our success or lack of success in commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022results from or delays in clinical trials of our product candidates, including our ongoing ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program in cervical dystonia and our Phase 2 program in adult upper limb spasticity with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection;\n\u2022announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval or delays in regulatory approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates;\n\u2022FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions or guidance affecting us or our industry, including travel restrictions in place at the FDA as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022introductions and announcements of new products by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions and announcements;\n\u2022our ability to increase market acceptance and adoption of and generate revenue from the HintMD platform;\n\u2022the impact on us and our future product offering, including the potential impact on our operating margin from the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our stock by insiders and large stockholders, or the expectation that such sales might occur;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022adverse tax laws or regulations enacted or existing laws applied to us or our customers;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022expiration or termination of our potential relationships with customers and strategic partners;\n\u2022the occurrence of trade wars or barriers, or the perception that trade wars or barriers will occur;\n\u2022any buying or selling of shares of our common stock or other hedging transactions in our common stock in connection with the 2027 Notes or the capped call transactions;\n\u2022widespread public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class actions against pharmaceutical companies, including us, following periods of volatility in their stock prices. Such litigation instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may cease to publish research on our company at any time in their discretion. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock. We will not have any control of the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. In November 2020, we entered into a sales agreement (the \u201c2020 Sales Agreement\u201d) with Cowen and Company, LLC (\u201cCowen\u201d), as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cowen, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million (the \u201cATM Offering\u201d). As of February 17, 2021, we have sold 3.3 million in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under the 2020 Sales Agreement.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. For instance, shares of our common stock that were issued to HintMD stockholders as consideration for the HintMD Acquisition, including those shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act, in some cases following the expiration of lock-up agreements entered into between Revance and HintMD directors and members of management and certain HintMD stockholders (the \u201cLock-Up Agreements\u201d). If former HintMD stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including following the expiration of the Lock-Up Agreements, the market price per share of our common stock may decline. Any sales of securities by stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022only one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issues shares of preferred stock and determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship;\n\u2022stockholders will not be permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors, by a majority vote, to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent or more of the outstanding common stock to amend many of the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that certain investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. The exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022We will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person\nreasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022We are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022We will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022The rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022We may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14467, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RVNC"}
