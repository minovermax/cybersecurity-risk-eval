{"cik": "870826", "company": "iMedia Brands, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses are subject to many risks. The following are material factors known to us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance. The following risks should be considered in evaluating an investment in us.\nRisks Relating to Our Businesses\nWe are subject to the auditor attestation requirement on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for our year ended January 29, 2022 and we and our auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is now subject to the requirement to include in this 2021 Form 10-K our auditor\u2019s attestation report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSOX\u201d). We and our auditors have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K as required under Section 404 of SOX. As some of these deficiencies are deemed material weaknesses in internal control over financing reporting, our auditors have issued an adverse opinion in their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The issuance of an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of January 29, 2022 and for the year then ended, we identified material weaknesses\nin our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified:\n\u25cf We did not maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the control environment of the COSO framework. Specifically, control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) appropriate organizational structure, reporting lines, and authority and responsibilities in pursuit of objectives; (ii) our commitment to attract, develop, and retain competent individuals; and (iii) holding individuals accountable for their internal control related responsibilities.\n\u25cf We did not design and implement an effective risk assessment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the risk assessment component of the COSO framework. Specifically, control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) identifying, assessing, and communicating appropriate objectives; (ii) identifying and analyzing risks to achieve these objectives; (iii) considering the potential for fraud in assessing risks; and (iv) identifying and assessing changes in the business that could impact our system of internal controls.\n\u25cf We did not design and implement effective control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the control activities component of the COSO framework. Specifically, control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) selecting and developing control activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks and support achievement of objectives; and (ii) deploying control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action.\n\u25cf We did not consistently generate or provide adequate quality supporting information and communication based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the information and communication component of the COSO framework. Specifically, control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) obtaining, generating, and using relevant quality information to support the functions of internal control; and (ii) communicating accurate information internally and externally, including providing information pursuant to objectives, responsibilities, and functions of internal control.\n\u25cf We did not design and implement effective monitoring activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the monitoring component of the COSO framework. Specifically, control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) selecting, developing, and performing ongoing evaluation to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning; and (ii) evaluating and communicating internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action.\nIf we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.\nWe have a history of losses and a high fixed cost operating base and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations in the future.\nWe experienced operating losses of approximately $10,725, $7,940 and $52,525 in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. We reported net losses of $23,026, $13,234 and $56,296 in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations in future fiscal years. Our television shopping business operates with a high fixed cost base, primarily driven by fixed fees under distribution agreements with cable and direct-to-home satellite providers to carry our programming. In order to operate on a profitable basis, we must reach and maintain sufficient annual sales revenues to cover our high fixed cost base and/or negotiate a reduction in this cost structure. If our sales levels are not sufficient to cover our operating expenses, our ability to reduce operating expenses in the near term will be limited by the fixed cost base. In that case, our earnings, cash balance and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nGiven this trend, if not reversed, it could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we will not have sufficient liquidity to meet the ongoing cash commitments and obligations to continue operating our business. As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately $11,295 in unrestricted cash. We expect to use our cash and available credit line to finance our working capital requirements and to make necessary capital expenditures in order to operate our business and to fund any further operating losses. We have had a historic trend of operating losses, which, if not reversed, could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we would not be able to adequately fund working capital requirements or necessary capital expenditures.\nWe have had a historic trend of operating losses, which, if not reversed, could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we will not have sufficient liquidity to meet the ongoing cash commitments and obligations to continue operating our business.\nGiven this trend, if not reversed, it could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we will not have sufficient liquidity to meet the ongoing cash commitments and obligations to continue operating our business. As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately $11,295 in unrestricted cash. We expect to use our cash and available credit line to finance our working capital requirements and to make necessary capital expenditures in order to operate our business and to fund any further operating losses. We have had a historic trend of operating losses, which, if not reversed, could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we would not be able to adequately fund working capital requirements or necessary capital expenditures.\nWe have a loan and security agreement (as amended through September 20, 2021, the \u201cSiena Loan\u201d) with Siena Lending Group LLC (\u201cSiena\u201d), and the other lenders party thereto from time to time, Siena Lending Group LLC, as agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d), and certain additional of our subsidiaries, as guarantors thereunder. The Siena Loan provides a revolving line of credit of up to $80,000 and provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $5,000 which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the revolving line of credit.\nAs of January 29, 2022, we had total borrowings of $60,216 under our revolving line of credit with Siena. Remaining available capacity under the revolving line of credit as of January 29, 2022 was approximately $11,400, which provided liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of January 29, 2022, we were in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the Siena Credit Facility and expect to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months.\nWe and our subsidiaries (the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) have a Promissory Note Secured by Mortgages with GreenLake Real Estate Finance LLC whereby GreenLake agreed to make a secured term loan to the Borrowers in the original amount of $28,500. The GreenLake Note is secured by, among other things, mortgages encumbering our owned properties in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Bowling Green, Kentucky (collectively, the \u201cMortgages\u201d) as well as other assets as described in the GreenLake Note. The GreenLake Note is scheduled to mature on July 31, 2024.\nAs of January 29, 2022, there was $28,500 outstanding under the term loan with GreenLake. Principal borrowings under the term loan are non-amortizing over the life of the loan.\nWe completed and closed on our $80,000 offering of 8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and issued the Note. As of January 29, 2022, the entire $80,000 principal amount of the Notes was outstanding.\nWe have significant future commitments for our cash, which primarily include payments for cable and satellite program distribution obligations and the eventual repayment of the Siena Loan, GreenLake Financing, and Senior Notes. Based on our current projections for fiscal 2022, we believe that our existing cash balances and available credit line will be sufficient to maintain liquidity to fund our normal business operations over the next twelve months. We further believe that our financial resources, along with managing expenses, will allow us to manage the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future which may include reduced sales and net income levels for us.\nThe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations.\nOur businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuation, with the highest sales activity normally occurring during our fourth fiscal quarter of the year, namely November through January. Additionally, in our entertainment reporting segment, our television audience (and therefore sales revenue) can be significantly impacted by major world or domestic television-covering events which attract viewership and divert audience attention away from our programming. The seasonality of\nour businesses places increased strain on our operations. If we do not stock or restock popular products sufficient to meet customer demand, our business would be adversely affected. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. Additionally, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during peak periods, and delivery services and other fulfillment companies and customer service providers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. The occurrence of any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are negatively influenced by adverse economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business is sensitive to general economic conditions and business conditions affecting consumer spending including, for example, increased inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our businesses, financial condition and results of operations are negatively influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending. If macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations may be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the duration and extent to which it will impact our results of operations remains uncertain. Our operations may also be limited or impacted by government monitoring and/or regulation of product sales in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, financial results and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customers\u2019 demand for our services and products; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; our ability to sell and provide our services and products, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; disruptions to our operations resulting from the illness of any of our employees, including employees at our fulfillment center; restrictions or disruptions to transportation, including reduced availability of ground or air transport; the ability of our customers to pay for our services and products; and any closures of our and our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 facilities. We have been experiencing disruptions to our business as we implement modifications to employee travel, employee work locations and cancellation of events, among other modifications. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, commodity and energy prices, and interest rates. If any of these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were to worsen, it could result in lost or delayed revenue to us. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Our employees have been and could be subject to work-from-home orders and other limitations on our business in the states in which we operate. The restrictions, among other things, require us to operate with only certain employees in-person at our facilities. We have focused on taking necessary steps to keep our employees, contractors, vendors, customers, guests, and their families safe during these uncertain times. These uncertainties could reduce our profitability and impact our results of operations.\nOur expansion to international markets subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nAs a result of the acquisition of the 1-2-3.tv, our operations have expanded to international markets, including Germany and Austria, which exposes us to significant new risks. 1-2-3.tv operates in Germany and Austria, which requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, economic, and political risks in addition to those we already faced in the United States. These include:\n\u25cf the need to successfully adapt and localize products and policies for specific countries, including obtaining rights to third-party intellectual property used in each country;\n\u25cf successfully adapting and localizing products and policies for specific countries, including obtaining rights to third-party intellectual property used in each country;\n\u25cf complying with compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records and a system of sufficient internal controls;\n\u25cf complying with increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf inflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;\n\u25cf challenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u25cf unstable political and economic conditions, social unrest or economic instability, whatever the cause, including due to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions, environmental risks, and security concerns, in general or in a specific country or region in which we operate.\n\u25cf complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in other jurisdictions; complying with increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; planning for fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; and political or social unrest or economic instability, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general in a specific country or region in which we operate.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing, acquiring, or integrating operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.\nOur ValuePay installment payment program could lead to significant unplanned credit losses if our credit loss rate materially deteriorates.\nIn our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, our ValuePay installment payment program could lead to significant unplanned credit losses if our credit loss rate materially deteriorates. We utilize an installment payment program called ValuePay that enables customers to purchase merchandise and pay for the merchandise in two or more monthly installments. Our ValuePay installment program is a key element of our promotional strategy. As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately $47,008 due from customers under the ValuePay installment program. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. There is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rate that we have in the past or that losses will be within current provisions. A significant increase in our credit losses above what we have been experiencing could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance.\nThe majority of customer purchases are paid for by credit or debit cards, including our private label credit card discussed above. Purchases and installment charges made with the ShopHQ private label credit card are non-recourse to us. However, we have credit collection risk from the potential inability to collect future ValuePay installments. Our ValuePay program is an interest-free installment payment program which allows customers to pay by credit card for certain merchandise in two or more equal monthly installments. The percentage of our net sales in which our customers utilized our ValuePay payment program over the past three fiscal years ranged from 50% to 57%. We intend to continue to sell merchandise using the ValuePay program due to its significant promotional value.\nOur dependence on a limited number of vendors may impair our ability to operate profitably in the event of an unanticipated loss of such a vendor:\nIn our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, we purchase products from domestic and foreign manufacturers and/or their suppliers and are often able to make purchases on more favorable terms due to the volume of products purchased or sold. Some of our purchasing arrangements with our vendors include inventory terms that allow for return privileges for a portion of the order or stock balancing. We generally do not have long-term commitments with our vendors, and a variety of sources are available for each category of merchandise sold. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, products purchased from one vendor accounted for approximately 16%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, products purchased from a second vendor accounted for approximately 11% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Both vendors are related parties and additional information is contained in Note 19 - \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we could find alternative products for these vendors\u2019 merchandise assortment if they ceased supplying merchandise; however, the unanticipated loss of any large supplier could negatively impact our sales and earnings.\nWe rely on a limited number of independent shipping companies to deliver our merchandise. If our independent shipping companies fail to deliver our merchandise in a timely and accurate manner, our reputation and brand may be damaged. If relationships with our independent shipping companies are terminated, we may experience an increase in delivery costs. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways.\nThe Siena Credit Facility contains various representation, warranties and financial and other covenants that limit our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders. The financial covenants include a maximum senior leverage ratio and minimum liquidity requirements. Please refer to Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Liquidity\u201d below for a discussion of the Siena Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Siena Credit Facility, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Siena Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lender could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lender and counter parties under the Siena Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of obligations, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such obligations. Our borrowings under the Siena Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will also increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income would decrease.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to capture and retain customers in a cost-effective manner.\nIn our entertainment and consumer brands segments, our success depends on our continued ability to capture and retain customers in a cost-effective manner. In an effort to attract and retain customers, we use considerable funds and resources for various marketing and merchandising initiatives, particularly for the production and distribution of television programming and the updating of our digital strategy to increasingly engage customers through digital channels and social media. These initiatives, however, may not resonate with existing customers or consumers generally or may not be cost-effective. We believe that costs associated with the production and distribution of our television programming and costs associated with digital marketing, including search engine marketing and social media marketing, may increase in the foreseeable future. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our website to place lower in search query results. Furthermore, the failure to successfully manage our search engine optimization and search engine marketing strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our website, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic. Any failure to sustain user traffic or to monetize such traffic could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our business and, as a result, adversely affect our financial results. In addition, customers continue to increase their expectations for faster delivery times with free or reduced shipping prices. Increased delivery costs, particularly if we are unable to offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand, and the extent to which we offer shipping promotions to our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to recruit and retain key employees may adversely impact our ability to sustain growth.\nOur growth is contingent, in part, on our ability to retain and recruit employees who have the distinct skills necessary for a business that demands knowledge of the interactive media industry, digital advertising industry, omnichannel retail industry, merchandising and product sourcing, television production, televised and internet-based marketing and direct-to-consumer and retail store fulfillment. In recent years, we have experienced significant senior management turnover and reductions in force as discussed in Note 21 - \u201cExecutive and Management Transition Costs\u201d and Note 20 - \u201cRestructuring Costs\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The marketplace for such key employees is very competitive and limited. Our growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and retain key employees. In addition, turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations, our vendor relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Further we may incur significant expenses related\nto any executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. In fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 we recorded charges to income of $0, $0 and $2,741, respectively, related to executive and management transition costs incurred, which included severance payments and other incremental expenses.\nAny acquisition we make could adversely impact our performance.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire other businesses. An acquisition involves certain inherent risks, including the failure to retain key personnel from an acquired business; undisclosed or subsequently arising liabilities; failure to successfully integrate operations of the acquired business into our existing business, such as new product offerings or information technology systems; failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions or revenue gains; and the potential diversion of management resources from existing operations to respond to unforeseen issues arising in the context of the integration of a new business. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses in connection with acquisitions and our overall profitability could be adversely affected if our associated investments and expenses are not justified by the revenues and profits, if any.\nRisks Relating to the Products We Market and Sell\nWe depend on relationships with numerous manufacturers and suppliers for our products and proprietary brands; a decrease in product quality or an increase in product cost, the unanticipated loss of our larger suppliers, or the lack of customer receptivity or brand acceptance to our proprietary brands could impact our sales.\nWe procure merchandise from numerous manufacturers and suppliers generally pursuant to short-term contracts and purchase orders. We depend on the ability of these parties to timely produce and deliver goods that meet applicable quality standards, which is impacted by a number of factors not within the control of these parties, such as political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and transport capacity and costs, among others, and to deliver products that meet or exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.\nOur failure to identify new vendors and manufacturers, maintain relationships with a significant number of existing vendors and manufacturers and/or access quality merchandise in a timely and efficient manner could cause us to miss customer delivery dates or delay scheduled promotions, which could result in the failure to meet customer expectations and could cause customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to source merchandise in sufficient quantities, which could result in lost sales.\nIt is possible that one or more of our significant brands or vendors could experience financial difficulties and be unable to supply us their product. In addition, the unanticipated loss of one or a number of our significant brands or vendors, could materially and adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nOur efforts to accelerate the development of proprietary brands may require working capital investments for the development and promotion of new brands and concepts. In addition, factors such as minimum purchase quantities and reduced merchandise return rights, typically associated with the purchasing of products associated with proprietary brands, can lead to excess on-hand inventory if sales of these brands do not meet our expectations due to a lack of customer receptivity or brand acceptance. Our ability to successfully offer a wider assortment of proprietary merchandise may also be adversely impacted if any of the risks mentioned above related to our manufacturers and suppliers materialize.\nIf we do not manage our inventory effectively, our sales, gross profit and profitability could be adversely affected. If we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough, we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. If we purchase too much inventory, we may be forced to sell our merchandise at lower average margins through increased markdowns, which could adversely affect our results of operations, our overall gross margins and our profitability.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by products sold or developed by us, or we may be subject to voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or subject to liability for on-air statements made by our hosts or guest-hosts.\nProducts sold or developed by us may expose us to product liability or product safety claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls, which could involve significant expense incurred by us.\nWe maintain and have generally required the manufacturers and vendors of these products to carry product liability and errors and omissions insurance. We also require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such claims. There can be no assurance that we will maintain this insurance coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms, or that this insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims or even be available with respect to any particular claim. There also can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to maintain this insurance or that this coverage will be adequate or available with respect to any particular claims or will fulfill their contractual indemnification duties. Product liability claims could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance.\nWe may also be subject to involuntary product recalls, or we may voluntarily conduct a product recall. The costs associated with product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year, or for any particular recall event, could be significant. Although we maintain product recall insurance, and we require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such events, an involuntary product recall could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, the live unscripted nature of our television broadcasting may subject us to misrepresentation or false advertising claims by our customers, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. We are subject to two FTC consent decrees, one issued in 2001 and one issued in 2003; both have a duration of 20 years. They consist of claims involving recordkeeping, compliance policies, and attention to detail on claim substantiation. Violations of these decrees could result in significant civil fines and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Television Viewership Trends, Technologies & Costs\nChanges in technology and in consumer viewing patterns may negatively impact our video content viewing and could result in a decrease in revenue.\nAs a multiplatform interactive video service, we are dependent on our ability to attract and retain viewers and must successfully adapt to technological advances in the media entertainment industry, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms, such as digital video recorders, video-on-demand and subscription video-on-demand (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime). New technologies affect the manner in which our programming is distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, and the time and manner in which consumers view our programming. This trend has impacted the traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in cable and satellite subscriber levels across the industry. In order to respond to these developments, we have developed a multiplatform distribution approach, including delivering our content over various streaming applications such as Roku and Apple TV and distribution through social media platforms. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes which could result in a loss of viewership and a decrease in revenue.\nThe failure to secure suitable placement for our television programming could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain television viewers and could result in a decrease in revenue.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to compete for television viewers. Effectively competing for television viewers is dependent, in part, on our ability to secure placement of our television programming within a suitable programming tier at a desirable channel position or format. The majority of multi-video programming distributors now offer programming on a digital basis, which has resulted in increased channel capacity.\nIn the entertainment reporting segment, we generally operate under distribution agreements with cable operators, direct-to-home satellite providers and telecommunications companies to distribute our television programming over their systems. The terms of the distribution agreements typically range from one to five years. During any fiscal year, certain agreements with cable, satellite or other distributors may or have expired. Under certain circumstances, we or our distributors may cancel the agreements prior to their expiration. Additionally, we may elect not to renew distribution agreements whose terms result in sub-standard or negative contribution margins. The distribution agreements generally provide that we will pay each operator a monthly access fee, based on the number of homes receiving our programming, and in some cases marketing support payments. We frequently review distribution opportunities with cable system operators and broadcast stations providing for full- or part-time carriage of our programming. We believe that our major competitors to our entertainment brands leverage their economies of scale to incur cable and satellite distribution fees\nrepresenting a significantly lower percentage of their sales attributable to their television programming than we do, and that their fee arrangements are substantially on a commission basis (in some cases with minimum guarantees) rather than on the predominantly fixed-cost basis that we currently have. At our current sales level, our distribution costs as a percentage of total consolidated net sales are higher than those of our competition. However, we can leverage this fixed expense with sales growth to accelerate improvement in our profitability. We may not be able to expand or could lose some of our existing programming distribution if we cannot negotiate profitable distribution agreements.\nWe may not be able to maintain our satellite services in certain situations beyond our control, which may cause our programming to go off the air for a period of time and cause us to incur substantial additional costs.\nOur programming is presently distributed to cable systems, television stations and satellite dish operators via a leased communications satellite transponder. Satellite service may be interrupted due to a variety of circumstances beyond our control, such as satellite transponder failure, satellite fuel depletion, governmental action, preemption by the satellite service provider, solar activity and service failure. Our satellite transponder agreement provides us with preemptible back-up service if satellite transmission is interrupted under certain conditions. In the event of a serious transmission interruption where back-up service is not available, we may need to enter into new arrangements, resulting in substantial additional costs and the inability to broadcast our signal for some period of time.\nA natural disaster or significant weather event could seriously impact our ability to operate, including our ability to broadcast, operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations.\nOur television broadcast studios, internet operations, IT systems, merchandising team, inventory control systems, executive offices, and finance/accounting functions, among others, are in our adjacent offices at 6740 and 6690, Shady Oak Road in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. In addition, our only fulfillment and distribution facility is centralized at a location in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Fire, flood, severe weather, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt our broadcast, computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures, including the distribution of our network to our customers, at any time. While we have certain business continuity plans in place, no assurances can be given as to how quickly we would be able to resume operations and how long it may take to return to normal operations. We could incur substantial financial losses above and beyond what may be covered by applicable insurance policies, and may experience a loss of sales, customers, vendors and employees during the recovery period.\nA natural disaster or significant weather event could materially interfere with our customers\u2019 ability to receive our broadcast or reach us to purchase our products and services.\nOur operations rely on our customers\u2019 access to third party content distribution networks, communications providers and utilities like cable, satellite and OTT television services, as well as internet, telephone and power utilities. A natural disaster or significant weather event could make one or more of these third-party services unavailable to our customers and could lead to the deferral or loss of sales of our goods and services.\nRisks Related to Digital Advertising\nWe rely on integrations with demand- and supply-side advertising platforms, ad servers and social platforms. A decrease in demand for advertising and public criticism of digital advertising technology in the U.S. and internationally could adversely affect the demand for and use of our solutions.\nOur business depends, in part, on the demand for digital advertising technology. The digital advertising industry has been and may in the future be subject to reputational harm, negative media attention and public complaint relating to, among other things, the alleged lack of transparency and anti-competitive behavior among advertising technology companies. This public criticism could result in increased data privacy and anti-trust regulation in the digital advertising industry in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, our services are delivered in web browsers, mobile apps and other software environments where online advertising is displayed, and certain of these environments have announced future plans to phase out or end the use of cookies and other third-party tracking technology on their operating systems in order to provide more consumer data privacy. While our technology and solutions do not rely on\npersistent identifiers or cookie-based or cross-site tracking, these changes and other updates to software functionality in these environments could hurt our ability to effectively deliver our services.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict changes in overall advertiser demand for the channels in which it operates and cannot assure that our investment in formats will correspond to any such changes. Advertisers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of advertisements. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of advertisers to deliver content. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those advertisements, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability or user acceptance of these advertisements could adversely affect our business. Any decrease in the use of mobile, display, and video advertising, whether due to customers losing confidence in the value or effectiveness of such channels, regulatory restrictions, public criticism or other causes, or any inability to further penetrate CTV or enter new and emerging advertising channels, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any change or decrease in the demand for digital advertising, including on social media platforms as a result of avoidance campaigns or similar events, may negatively affect the demand for and use of our solutions. If our customers significantly reduce or eliminate their digital ad spend in response to the public criticism of the digital advertising industry or its related effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur stock price has been volatile, and continued volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation.\nMost recently, on April 21, 2022, the market price of our common stock, as reported on The Nasdaq Capital Market, closed at a price of $4.38 per share. The prices at which our common stock is quoted and the prices which investors may realize will be influenced by several factors, some specific to our company and operations and some that may affect our sector or public companies generally. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in securities\u2019 analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, including the first half of 2020, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. In addition, we may be subject to securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market and we could be delisted.\nEven though our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with standards necessary to maintain a listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our failure to meet the continuing listing requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile shareholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and impact the trading value of our securities. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and we are subject to the risks associated with such activism. In 2014, we were the subject of a proxy contest. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the board of directors, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be\nrequired to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses, as described further under Part II, Item 5 below. The Shareholder Rights Plan may have anti-takeover effects. The provisions of the Shareholder Rights Plan could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of us and could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nTrade policies, tariffs, tax or other government regulations that increase the effective price of products manufactured in other countries and imported into the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA material percentage of the products that we offer on our television programming and our e-commerce websites are imported by us or our vendors, from other countries. Uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs, tax and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has increased. Many of our vendors source a large percentage of the products we sell from other countries. Major developments in trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nWe may be subject to claims by consumers and state and federal authorities for security breaches involving customer information, which could materially harm our reputation and business or add significant administrative and compliance cost to our operations.\nIn order to operate our business, which includes multiple retail channels, we take orders for our products from customers. This requires us to obtain personal information from these customers including, but not limited to, credit card numbers. Although we take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect customer information, there is still the risk that external or internal security breaches or digital or telecommunications spoofing could occur, including cyber incidents. In addition, new tools and discoveries by third parties in computer or communications technology or software or other developments may facilitate or result in a future compromise of consumer information under applicable law or breach of our computer systems. Such compromises or breaches could result in consumer harm or risk of harm, data loss and/or identity theft leading to significant liability or costs to us from notification requirements, lawsuits brought by consumers, shareholders or other businesses seeking monetary redress, state and federal authorities for fines and penalties, and could also lead to interruptions in our operations and negative publicity causing damage to our reputation and limiting customers\u2019 willingness to purchase products from us. Businesses in the retail industry have experienced material sales declines after discovering data breaches, and our business could be similarly impacted by cyber incidents. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. While reputations may take decades to build, a significant negative incident can erode trust and confidence, particularly if it results in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Theft of credit card numbers of consumers could result in significant fines and consumer settlement costs, litigation costs, FTC audit requirements, and significant internal administrative costs.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations govern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and security of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers, content distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), state attorneys general, the European Commission, and European data protection authorities), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that identify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the internet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and foreign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants\u2019 ability to collect, use, and share\npersonal information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, and use of personal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in the context of EU operations) and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations and may require us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done.\nWe made changes to our data protection compliance program to prepare for the GDPR and will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not compliant with GDPR or other data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For example, under the GDPR, fines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data processing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR\u2019s requirements. Data protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business.\nIn addition to possible claims for security breaches involving customer information, the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of customer information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protect our customer information. The expenses associated with complying with a patchwork of state laws imposing differing security requirements depending on the residence of our customers could reduce our operating margins. As mentioned above, there have been continuing efforts to increase the legal and regulatory obligations and restrictions on companies conducting commerce, primarily in the areas of taxation, consumer privacy and protection of consumer personal information, and we may have to devote significant resources to information security.\nNearly all of our sales are paid for by customers using credit or debit cards and the increasingly heightened Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) standards regarding the storage and security of customer information could potentially impact our ability to accept card brands.\nNearly all of our customers pay for purchases via a credit or debit card. Credit and debit card payment organizations continue to heighten PCI standards that are applicable to all merchants who accept these cards. These standards primarily pertain to the processes and procedures for encrypted use and secure storage of customer data. By virtue of the volume of our overall credit card transactions, we are a Level 1 merchant which requires the annual completion of a formal Report of Compliance (\u201cROC\u201d) by a Qualified Security Assessor. Failure to comply with PCI standards, as required by card issuers, could result in card brand fines and/or the possible inability for us to accept a card brand. Our inability to accept one or all card brands could materially adversely affect sales. Although we received an approved ROC on July 31, 2020, there is no guarantee that we will continue to receive such approvals.\nTechnology and Intellectual Property Risks\nWe significantly rely on technology and information management tools and operational applications to run our existing businesses, the failure of which could adversely impact our operations.\nOur businesses are dependent, in part, on the use of sophisticated technology, some of which is provided to us by third parties. These technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, satellite based transmission of our programming, use of the internet and other mobile commerce devices in relation to our on-line business, new digital technology used to manage and supplement our television broadcast operations, the age of our legacy operational applications to distribute product to our customers and a network of complex computer hardware and software to manage an ever increasing need for information and information management tools. The failure of any of these legacy systems or operational infrastructure elements, technologies, or our inability to have this technology supported, updated, expanded or integrated into new business processes or other technologies, could adversely impact our operations. Although we have developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into our computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect us against all potential issues or disaster occurrences related to the loss of any such technologies or their use. Further, we may face challenges in keeping pace with rapid technological changes and adopting new products or platforms and migrating to new systems.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely heavily upon software, databases and other systemic components that are necessary to manage and support our business operations, many of which utilize or incorporate third party products, services or technologies. In addition, we license intellectual property rights in connection with the various products and services we offer to consumers. As a result, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to third party intellectual property we utilize or that is related to our contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names; limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names; limit our useful technologies; disrupt normal business operations or result in unanticipated costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77007, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "IMBI"}
