RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our company. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose a part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Operations\nWe did not make timely payment of outstanding principal when due under our Series A Debentures, and failure to make such payment is an event of default under the debentures. We have insufficient cash resources to repay the amounts due to our debenture holders.\nThe principal amount of our outstanding Series A Debentures of $1,688,205 became due on July 1, 2011, and such amount was not paid. Therefore, the Company could be considered in default and may result in enforcement of the debenture holders\u2019 rights and remedies under the debentures and applicable law. We are in discussions with the debenture holders to re-negotiate the terms of the debentures, including the repayment or repurchase of the debentures and/or seek to extend their maturity date, although we have not reached any agreement with the debenture holders with regard to any such repayment, repurchase or extension. Our ability to repay or repurchase the debentures is contingent upon our ability to raise additional financing, of which there can be no assurance. Also, as a condition to any such extension, debenture holders may seek to amend or modify certain other terms of the debentures. When an event of default occurs under the debentures, the debenture holders may elect to require us to make immediate repayment of the mandatory default amount, which equals the sum of (i) the greater of either (a) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures, or (b) the outstanding principal amount unpaid divided by the conversion price on the date the mandatory default amount is either (1) demanded or otherwise due or (2) paid in full, whichever has the lower conversion price, multiplied by the variable weighted average price of the common stock on the date the mandatory default amount is either demanded or otherwise due, whichever has the higher variable weighted average price, and (ii) all other amounts, costs, expenses, and liquidated damages due under the debentures. In anticipation of such election by the debenture holders, due to the nonpayment of principal amount on the due date of July 1, 2011, we measured the mandatory default at approximately $337,641 and subsequently on each balance sheet date, which is reflected in the carrying value of the debentures and also recognized as interest expense. We remeasured the mandatory default amount as of December 31, 2014 at approximately $337,641. As of the date of this report, the debenture holders have not made an election requiring immediate repayment of the mandatory amount, although there can be no assurance they will not do so. The Company currently has insufficient funds to repay the outstanding amount in the event the debenture holders make a demand for payment.\nOur business plan and technologies are unproven. We have generated minimal revenues from our operation, and incurred substantial operating losses since our inception. We have very limited cash resources and we are reliant on external sources of financing to fund our operations, including our ongoing product development.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our revenue generating activities have not produced sufficient funds for profitable operations and we have incurred operating losses since inception. In view of these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations, which in turn is dependent upon our ability to meet our financial requirements, raise additional financing on acceptable terms, and the success of future operations. The principal amount due to our debenture holders as of December 31, 2014, was $1,688,205, which matured on June 30, 2011, and was not paid. Also, we have outstanding trade and accrued payables of $1,792,192, other accrued liabilities of $242,404, and accrued salaries and related due to our employees and management of $8,792,108. Also, our previous Chief Executive Officer\u2019s net outstanding noninterest-bearing loans were $80,500.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a cash balance of $33,961. Management believes these funds to be insufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months absent any cash flow from operations or funds from the sale of our equity or debt securities. Currently, we are spending or incurring (and accruing) expenses of approximately $150,000 per month on operations and the continued research and development of our 3i technologies and products, including with regard to salaries and consulting fees. Management believes that we will require an aggregate of approximately $1,800,000 to fund our operations for the next 12 months and to repay certain outstanding trade payables and accrued expenses. This assumes that holders of our outstanding debentures convert such debt into shares of our common stock or that we are able to extend the term of the debentures, of which there can be no assurance. In the event we are unable to extend the term of the debentures beyond their new maturity date, the debenture holders do not convert such debt or require\npayment of principal, partially convert such debt, or effect the buy-in provision related to the warrants and the debentures, we shall be required to raise additional financing. Also, this assumes that we are able to continue to defer the amounts due to our employees for accrued and unpaid salaries and that we are able to continue to extend or defer payment of certain amounts due to our trade creditors, of which there can be no assurance.\nThe Company has relied and continues to rely substantially upon equity and debt financing to fund its ongoing operations, including the research and development conducted in connection with its products and conversion of accounts payable for stock. The proceeds from our financings have been and continue to be insufficient to fund our operations, pay our trade payables, repayment of our unconverted debentures, or accrued and unpaid wages to our employees. Therefore, the debentures holders, our employees, or trade creditors may seek to enforce payment of amounts due to them, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations. Also, in the event we continue to be unable to pay our employees, we may suffer further employee attrition. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to raise any additional financing, any bank borrowing, and research or grant funding. Moreover, in view of the current market price of our stock, we may have limited or no access to the capital markets. Furthermore, under the terms of our agreements with the debenture holders, we are subject to restrictions on our ability to engage in any transactions in our securities in which the conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price of such securities is below the current conversion price or is based upon the trading price of our securities after initial issuance or otherwise subject to re-set. In view of the foregoing, we may be required to curtail operations significantly, or obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might occur if we are unable to continue in business as a going concern.\nWe have generated limited revenue from our PinPoint\u2122 and Signature Mapping\u2122 products.\nWe have generated limited revenue from the sale of our aviation and healthcare products. There can be no assurance we will be successful in generating revenue from our products. We expect to incur additional product development costs to complete our Signature Mapping\u2122 Tuberculosis projects and other proof of concept projects if outside partners are solidified. We may also incur additional product development cost for PinPoint\u2122 if outside partnership or alliances are established. Although, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in launching the foregoing products in accordance with the timelines outlined, or that we will be successful in marketing and selling such products or generating significant revenue from such product.\nWe have a severe working capital deficit and, in addition to proceeds from financings, we continue to have outstanding loans from our chief executive officer and deferrals of salaries by our executive officer, employees and a consultant/director. In the event we are unable to pay our employees salaries, we may experience employee attrition which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nDuring 2014, our total stockholders\u2019 deficit increased by $644,719 to $13,570,796, and our consolidated net loss for the period was $783,378, compared to a net loss for the same period in 2013 of $2,437,304, or a decrease of $1,653,926 (67.9%). Our revenue generating activities had not produced sufficient funds for profitable operations and we have incurred operating losses since inception. Although we have obtained limited cash from certain financings, we continue to have outstanding loans from our previous chief executive officer of approximately $80,500, accrued and unpaid salaries of our two named executive officers and previous chief executive officer in the amount of $4,747,782, and to other employees of $3,406,614, and outstanding accounts payable to a previous consultant/director of the Company in the amount of $854,248. The Company currently employs three full-time, one part-time employee, and during 2013 employed five full-time, one part-time employee, and one employee on a temporary leave of absence who assisted the Company upon request. The Company\u2019s insolvency continues to increase the uncertainties related to its continued existence. Also, in the event we are unable to pay our employees, we may continue to experience further employee attrition which could materially adversely affect our business and operations, including our ongoing research and development activities. Both management and the Board of Directors are carefully monitoring the Company\u2019s cash flows and financial position in consideration of these increasing uncertainties and the needs of both creditors and stockholders.\nDilutive effect of conversion of Series A Senior Convertible Debentures, and the exercise of outstanding common stock purchase warrants, of which some carry a cashless exercise provision.\nAt December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 6,752,820 of our shares of our common stock issuable upon full conversion of our outstanding Series A Debentures. The Company also has an aggregate of 19,645,528 of our shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding common stock purchase warrants that have an average exercise price of $0.26, of which approximately 5,143,973 warrants may be exercised pursuant to the cashless exercise provisions of such warrants and may be subsequently resold as \u201crestricted securities\u201d under the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Increased sales volume of the Company\u2019s common stock could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to drop. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe have incurred substantial debt which could affect our ability to obtain additional financing and may increase our vulnerability to business downturns. We may be unable to repay our Series A Debentures that matured on June 30, 2011.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the aggregate principal under our outstanding Series A Debentures was $1,688,205, which matured on June 30, 2011. Also, we have outstanding trade and accrued payables of $1,792,192, other accrued liabilities of $242,404, and accrued salaries due to our employees and management of $8,152,396, as well as accrued related payroll liabilities of $639,712. Also, the Company has an outstanding noninterest-bearing loan from its previous Chief Executive Officer of $80,500, and $807,500 short-term notes from twenty (20) investors. We are subject to the risks associated with substantial indebtedness, including insufficient funds to repay the outstanding principal in the event the debenture holders make a demand for payment; it may be more expensive and difficult to obtain additional financing; and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns.\nOur certifying officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, and concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective for the period ending December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013, and that we had certain weaknesses during those periods in our internal controls over timely reporting. Therefore, internal controls over timely reporting were ineffective as of the period covered by this Report.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the \u201cCertifying Officers\u201d) are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). The Certifying Officers designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under their supervision, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and is made known to management (including the Certifying Officers) by others within the Company, including its subsidiaries. We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls quarterly in our Forms 10-Q and annually in our Forms 10-K. In completing such reporting, we disclose, as appropriate, any significant change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On November 6, 2013, the Company filed its June 30, 2013 Form 10-Q, which was due on August 14, 2013, and this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, was due on March 31, 2015. Our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by such reports. Although the Certifying Officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, management continues to believe that refinement to our disclosure controls and procedures is an ongoing progress. The Audit Committee believes the Company should continue the following activities: (a) additional education and professional development for the Company\u2019s accounting and other staff on new and existing applicable SEC filing requirements, certain applicable SEC disclosure requirements, and the timing of the filing thereof, and (b) reviewing disclosure requirements, including Form 10-K and Regulation S-K disclosure requirements, SEC staff guidance and interpretations related thereto. While management is responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures and has taken steps to ensure that the disclosure controls are effective and free of \u201csignificant deficiencies\u201d and/or \u201cmaterial weaknesses,\u201d the ability of management to implement the remediation of such weaknesses and deficiencies and the inherent nature of our business and rapidly changing environment may affect management\u2019s ability to be successful with this initiative.\nCurrent shareholdings may be diluted if we make future equity issuances or if outstanding debentures, warrants, and options are exercised for or converted into shares of common stock.\n\u201cDilution\u201d refers to the reduction in the voting effect and proportionate ownership interest of a given number of shares of common stock as the total number of shares increases. Our issuance of additional stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt may result in dilution to the interests of shareholders and may also result in the reduction of your stock price. The sale of a substantial number of shares into the market, or even the perception that sales could occur, could depress the price of the common stock. Also, the exercise of warrants and options may result in additional dilution.\nThe holders of outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock, if any, without assuming the risk of ownership, with a resulting dilution in the interests of other shareholders.\nWe may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital if it should be needed for our business while the options, warrants and convertible securities are outstanding. At any time at which the holders of the options, warrants or convertible securities might be expected to exercise or convert them, we would probably be able to obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided by those securities. Also, some holders of our warrants have piggy back registration rights requiring us to register their shares underlying such options and warrants in any registration statement we file under the Securities Act. The cost to us for such required registration may be substantial.\nWe may undertake acquisitions which pose risks to our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have and may in the future acquire or enter into joint venture arrangements with, or form strategic alliances with complementary businesses. Any such acquisition, investment, strategic alliance or related effort will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in such transactions. These risks may include:\n\u00b7\nDifficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates;\n\u00b7\nPaying more than the acquired company is worth;\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in assimilating the operations of the new business;\n\u00b7\nCosts associated with the development and integration of the operations of the new entity;\n\u00b7\nExisting business may be disrupted;\n\u00b7\nEntering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u00b7\nAccounting for acquisitions could require us to amortize substantial intangible assets (goodwill), adversely affecting our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nInability to retain the management and key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; or\n\u00b7\nCustomer attrition with respect to customers acquired through the acquisition.\nWe cannot assure you that we would successfully overcome these risks or any other problems associated with any acquisition, investment, strategic alliances, or related efforts. Also, if we use our common stock in connection with an acquisition, your percentage ownership in us will be reduced and you may experience additional dilution.\nInvestor confidence in the price of our stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs an SEC registrant, we are subject to the rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cmanagement\u2019s report\u201d). If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting, particularly that relating to revenue recognition, is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss in investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Investor confidence and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn order to comply with public reporting requirements, we must continue to strengthen our financial systems and controls, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial statements.\nRefinement of our internal controls and procedures will be required as we manage future growth successfully and operate effectively as a public company. Such refinement of our internal controls, as well as compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related requirements, will be costly and will place a significant burden on management. We cannot assure you that measures already taken, or any future measures, will enable us to provide accurate and timely financial reports, particularly if we are unable to hire additional personnel in our accounting and financial department, or if we lose personnel in this area. Any failure to improve our internal controls or other problems with our financial systems or internal controls could result in delays or inaccuracies in reporting financial information, or non-compliance with SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop. In addition, the market price of our common stock is highly volatile. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to drop include:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nTiming and announcements of new customer orders, new products, or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nAny acquisitions that we make or joint venture arrangements we enter into with third parties;\n\u00b7\nChanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock;\n\u00b7\nFailure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock resulting from sales of new shares, or the exercise of warrants, stock options or convertible securities;\n\u00b7\nReluctance of any market maker to make a market in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nChanges in investors\u2019 perception of the transportation security scanning and healthcare information technology industries generally; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral stock market conditions.\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on OTC Markets, OTCQB under the symbol \u201cAPVS.\u201d As a result, relatively small trades in our stock could have disproportionate effect on our stock prices. No assurance can be made that an active market for our common stock will continue.\nThe OTC Markets is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information for shares of stock that are not designated for quotation on a national securities exchange. Trades in OTC Markets, OTCQB quoted stocks will be displayed only if the trade is processed by an institution acting as a market maker for those shares. Although there are approximately 12 market makers for our stock, these institutions are not obligated to continue making a market for any specific period of time. Thus, there can be no assurance that any institution will be acting as a market maker for our common stock at any time. If there is no market maker for our stock and no trades in those shares are reported, it may be difficult for you to dispose of your shares or even to obtain accurate quotations as to the market price for your shares. Moreover, because the order handling rules adopted by the SEC that apply to other listed stocks do not apply to OTC Markets, OTCQB quoted stock, no market maker is required to maintain an orderly market in our common stock. Accordingly, an order to sell our stock placed with a market maker may not be processed until a buyer for the shares is readily available, if at all, which may further limit your ability to sell your shares at prevailing market prices.\nBecause we became public through a reverse acquisition, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms or institutional investors.\nWe became a public company through a reverse acquisition in June 2003. Accordingly, securities analysts and major brokerage firms and securities institutions may not cover our common stock since there is no incentive to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that established brokerage firms will want to conduct any financing for us in the future.\nOur common stock is subject to the SEC\u2019s Penny Stock Regulations.\nOur common stock is subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. These regulations define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, these rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered underwriter, current quotations for the securities, information on the limited market in penny stocks and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers\u2019 presumed control over the market. In addition, the broker-dealer must obtain a written statement from the customer that such disclosure information was provided and must retain such acknowledgment for at least three years. Further, monthly statements must be sent disclosing current price information for the penny stock held in the account. The penny stock rules also require that broker-dealers engaging in a transaction in a penny stock make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. The foregoing rules may materially and adversely affect the liquidity for the market of our common stock. Such rules may also affect the\nability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock, the ability of holders of such securities to obtain accurate price quotations and may therefore impede the ability of holders of our common stock to sell such securities in the secondary market.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage mergers and other transactions.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay or prevent someone from acquiring our business. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The use of a staggered board of directors and the ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock are traditional anti-takeover measures. These provisions may be beneficial to our management and the board of directors in a hostile tender offer, and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of the board of directors.\nOur board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 6,000 have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 6,000 shares as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and 1,000 shares as Class C Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which shares are outstanding on the date of the filing of this report. Accordingly, our board of directors may, without shareholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred stock with rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging, an acquisition or change of control of Applied Visual Sciences, Inc. Although we do not have any current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur success depends of the contributions of our key management personnel, including Mr. William J. Donovan, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Secretary, and Mr. Gregory E. Hare, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. If we lose the services of any of such personnel we could be delayed in or precluded from achieving our business objectives. We do not have key man life insurance on any of our officers.\nIn addition, the loss of key members of our sales and marketing teams or key technical service personnel could jeopardize our positive relations with our customers. Any loss of key technical personnel would jeopardize the stability of our infrastructure and our ability to provide the service levels our customers expect. The loss of any of our key officers or personnel could impair our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, because we substantially rely on their experience and management skills.\nOur directors and named executive officers own a substantial percentage of our common stock.\nAs of July 17, 2015, our directors, executive officers and the estate of our previous chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 27.8% of our shares of common stock. Accordingly, our directors, executive officers, the estate of our previous chief executive officer, and most highly compensated employee are entitled to cast an aggregate of 12,713,534 votes on matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote or approximately 11.9% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of our stockholders. These stockholders, if they acted together, could exert substantial control over matters requiring approval by our stockholders. These matters would include the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain additional skilled personnel may impact our ability to develop our technology and attract customers in growing our business. However, we have limited cash resources to hire additional personnel and have experienced employee attrition due to our inability to pay our employees.\nWe believe that our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical, managerial and sales personnel, particularly in the areas of technology-based application development, business intelligence, knowledge extraction, management, product development, healthcare economics, radiology, integration and technical support, is essential to our future success. Our business requires individuals with significant levels of expertise in knowledge extraction, business operations, mathematics, quantitative analysis, and machine learning. Competition for such personnel is intense, and qualified technical personnel are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications, particularly in the desired geographic location, can be costly and difficult. We may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy, or we may need to provide higher compensation to such personnel than we currently anticipate. Also, due to our limited cash resources, we have not been able to pay our employees and have accrued and unpaid wages and related costs due to our current and certain former employees of approximately $8,792,108, which includes accrued and unpaid salaries due all such employees of $8,152,396 and accrued\nrelated payroll liabilities of $639,712. Accordingly, we have experienced employee attrition and may not be able to attract new employees when we need to do so. If we fail to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees, our ability to provide the necessary products, technologies, and services may be limited, and as a result, we may be unable to attract customers and grow our business.\nOur lease expired in January 2013 and was not be able to extend our existing lease, and elected not to obtain a lease for new office space because of our financial condition and limited cash resources.\nThe Company\u2019s office lease for our principal executive offices expired on January 31, 2013. The lease did include a renewal provision, and due to our financial condition and limited cash, the Company was not able to renew the lease, and elected to not obtain a lease for office space due to terms that are unacceptable to us.\nWe have never paid a cash dividend\nWe have not declared a cash dividend and we do not anticipate declaring or paying such dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Our Industries\nChanges may take place in funding for healthcare.\nWe expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of clinical healthcare information systems, and other related services within the healthcare industry. As a result, our success is dependent in part on political and economic conditions as they relate to the healthcare industry.\nVirtually all of our prospective customers in the healthcare industry are subject to governmental regulation, including Medicare and Medicaid regulation.\nAccordingly, our prospective customers and other entities with which we may develop a business relationship are affected by changes in such regulations and limitations in governmental spending for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Recent actions by Congress have limited governmental spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limited payments to hospitals and other providers under such programs, and increased emphasis on competition and other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. In addition, federal and state legislatures have considered proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level. If enacted, these proposals could increase government involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our prospective customers and other entities with which we may develop a business relationship. Our prospective customers and other entities with which we may develop a business relationship could react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products and services.\nIn addition, many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our anticipated products and services, which would negatively impact our expected operating margins. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring each customer will become greater.\nProduct liability and other claims may occur.\nAny failure by our products that provide applications relating to patient diagnostic procedures, and treatment plans could expose us to product liability claims for personal injury and wrongful death. Unsuccessful claims could be costly to defend and divert management time and resources. In addition, we have not been able to maintain general liability, or directors and officers coverage, and cannot make assurances that we will have appropriate insurance available to us in the future at commercially reasonable and affordable rates. We expect to seek general liability and directors and officers coverage upon securing adequate financing, and product liability and other customary coverage upon the commercialization of our intelligent computer-vision detection (\u201c3i\u2122\u201d) technology.\nSpecific government regulations relating to Medicare and Medicaid may impinge on us.\nMany of our prospective customers and the other entities with which we may develop a business relationship operate in the healthcare industry and, as a result, are subject to governmental regulation. Because our healthcare products and services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement systems currently in place in the United States, and because we are pursuing a strategy of developing and marketing products and services that support our customers' regulatory and compliance efforts, we may become subject to the reach of, and liability under, these regulations.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Law, among other things, prohibits the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for Medicare, Medicaid and certain other federal or state healthcare program patient referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by the federal health care programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil and criminal sanction and liability, including the temporary or permanent exclusion of the violator from government health programs, treble damages and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. If the activities of a customer or other entity with which we have a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and we, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, we could be subject to sanction or liability under such laws, including exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, our customers would not be permitted to make any payments to us.\nThe federal Civil False Claims Act and the Medicare/Medicaid Civil Money Penalties regulations prohibit, among other things, the filing of claims for services that were not provided as claimed, which were for services that were not medically necessary, or which were otherwise false or fraudulent. Violations of these laws may result in civil damages, including treble and civil penalties. In addition the Medicare/Medicaid and other federal statutes provide for criminal penalties for such false claims. If, as a result of the provision by us of products or services to our customers or other entities with which we have a business relationship, we provide assistance with the provision of inaccurate financial reports to the government under these regulations, or we are found to have knowingly recorded or reported data relating to inappropriate payments made to a healthcare provider, we could be subject to liability under these laws.\nMedical device regulation may require us to obtain approval for our products.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) have promulgated a policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. To the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy, we, as a manufacturer of such products, could be required, depending on the product, to:\n\u00b7\nregister and list its products with the FDA;\n\u00b7\nnotify the FDA and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products; or\n\u00b7\nobtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product.\nDepending on the intended use of a device, the FDA could require us to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness, or substantial equivalence. If the FDA requires this data, we would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials. Clinical trials can take extended periods of time and substantial funds to complete. We cannot provide assurances that the FDA will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials. In addition, these products would be subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's general controls, including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting. Although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the FDA's policy with regard to computer software, we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed. The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions like service investigation, approval, labeling and manufacturing. In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes.\nSystem errors and warranties may subject us to liability.\nOur technology is very complex. As is the case with all complex and new systems, our product may contain errors especially when first introduced. Our technology is intended to provide information to security agencies for threat detection, and to healthcare providers for use in medical diagnosis. Therefore, users of our products may have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally. Failure of a system to perform in accordance with its documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and require us to incur additional expenses in order to make the system comply with the documentation. If such failure is not timely remedied, it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract and subject us to liability.\nWe retain and transmit confidential information; including patient health information. A security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Despite the implementation of security measures, this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of our security, whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with, could reduce demand for our services and products.\nCustomer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if our business experiences delays, failures or loss of data in its systems. The occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities, or at any third party facility, including telecommunications provider facilities, could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data, which could harm our business.\nWe may infringe the proprietary rights of others.\nIf any of our products violate third party proprietary rights, we may be required to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our products without substantial reengineering. Any efforts to reengineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful, in which case we may be forced to stop selling the infringing product or remove the infringing functionality or feature. We may also become subject to damage awards as a result of infringing the proprietary rights of others, which could cause us to incur additional losses and have an adverse impact on our financial position. We do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technologies used in our products infringe patents held by others. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending; many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.\nUnforeseeable disruption in the economy may take place consequent to terrorism or other international events.\nThe terrorist events of September 11, 2001, as well as new terrorists threats, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the possibility of war in other areas of the Middle East, have sensitized us and many other businesses to the potential disruption that such activities can have on the economy, the business cycle and, ultimately on the financial performance of these organizations. It is impossible to know whether such terrorist or military activities will continue, and whether, and to what extent, they may cause a disruption that may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may face competition from other developers or sellers of imaging and radiology technology and baggage screening technology.\nWhile the market for imaging and radiology technology is highly fragmented, we face competition from other companies which are developing products that are expected to be competitive with our healthcare products. We also face potential competition from other companies developing baggage screening technology and from baggage scanner manufacturers. Business in general is highly competitive, and we compete with both large multinational solution providers and smaller companies. Some of our competitors have more capital, longer operating and market histories, and greater resources than we have, and may offer a broader range of products and at lower prices than we offer.\nA number of factors that will affect our revenues will make our future results difficult to predict, and therefore we may not meet expectations for a particular period.\nWe believe that our future revenues when it occurs may have the potential to vary significantly from time to time. We believe that these variations may result from many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing, size and mix of orders from our major customers including, in particular, the Department of Homeland Security and agencies of foreign governments;\n\u00b7\nlegislative or other government actions driven, in part, by the public\u2019s perception of the threats facing commercial aviation, leading to fluctuations in demand for transportation security scanning products and services;\n\u00b7\ndelays in product shipments caused by the inability of airports to install or integrate our products in a timely fashion;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and cost of key components;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of completion of acceptance testing for some of our products by various U.S. agencies and foreign governments;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction and acceptance of new products or enhancements to existing products offered by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in pricing policies by us, our competitors or our suppliers, including possible decreases in average selling prices of our products caused by customer volume orders or in response to competitive pressures; and\n\u00b7\nour sales mix to domestic and international customers.\nWe expect to depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our future revenues.\nA significant portion of our quarterly and annual operating expenses is expected to be relatively fixed in nature. This means that future revenue fluctuations will cause our quarterly and annual operating results to vary substantially. We also may choose to increase spending to pursue new market opportunities, which may negatively affect our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our PinPoint\u2122 product will be selected by the U.S. DHS or other countries\u2019 security departments or address their solutions needs for threat detection, or that our Signature Mapping\u2122 product will be accepted in the healthcare arena.\nGovernmental agencies, the primary customers for our PinPoint\u2122 products are subject to budget processes which could limit the demand for these products.\nSubstantially all of the potential customers for our PinPoint\u2122 products under development to date have been public agencies or quasi-public agencies, such as the FAA, the TSA, airport authorities and manufactures of threat detection devices. Public agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints.\nThe funding of government programs is subject to legislative appropriation. Budgetary allocations for PinPoint\u2122 depend, in part, upon governmental policies, which fluctuate from time to time in response to political and other factors, including the public\u2019s perception of the threat of commercial airline bombings. For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 resulted in the passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, or Transportation Security Act, mandating a small surcharge on each airline ticket purchase to fund airline security. This surcharge was suspended from June 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003. We cannot assure investors that the surcharge will not again be suspended or that the funds generated by these surcharges will be used to purchase our PinPoint\u2122 products. We cannot assure investors that funds will continue to be appropriated by Congress or allocated by the TSA or other agencies for the purchase of PinPoint\u2122 product or any other such product we develop and market. Moreover, we expect that similar funding and appropriations issues will affect our ability to market and sell our PinPoint\u2122 product outside the United States.\nLegislative actions could lead to fluctuations in demand for transportation security scanning products and services.\nIn addition to the Congressional budgetary process, other legislation could be introduced that would impact demand for transportation security scanning products and services. In response to fluctuation in concern on the part of voters about transportation security scanning and competing homeland security demands, or for other reasons, the plans for deployment of our PinPoint\u2122 product to screen baggage could be changed. Budgetary debates and delays could result in fewer PinPoint\u2122 products being sold to the TSA.\nGovernmental agencies have special contracting requirements, which create additional risks.\nIn contracting with public agencies, we are subject to public agency contract requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Future sales to public agencies will depend, in part, on our ability to meet public agency contract requirements, certain of which may be onerous or even impossible for us to satisfy. Government contracts typically contain termination provisions unfavorable to us and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which subject us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:\n\u00b7\nsuspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nterminate of future contracts;\n\u00b7\nreduce the scope and value of our future contracts;\n\u00b7\naudit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u00b7\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of our products, and\n\u00b7\nchange certain terms and conditions in our contracts.\nThe U.S. government or foreign governments can terminate any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms. Termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, and settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions do not permit these recoveries and make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments may contain similar provisions. In the event we enter into one or more government contracts for PinPoint\u2122, the government\u2019s termination of any such contracts for our PinPoint\u2122 product under development would harm our business.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds annually for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year-end basis, even though contract performance may take years. Consequently, our future contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) may only be partially funded at the outset, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by DHS only as appropriations are made by Congress for future periods. The government\u2019s failure to fully fund one or more of the contracts for our PinPoint\u2122 product under development would harm our business.\nBecause we expect to contract with the U.S. government, we will be subject to periodic audits and reviews. Based on the results of its audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In the future, government audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our revenues and cause other adverse effects, particularly to our relationship\nwith the TSA. In addition, under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of our research and development costs, and some marketing expenses may not be reimbursable or allowed in our negotiation of fixed-price contracts. Further, because we expect to contract with the U.S. government, we will be subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not.\nIn addition, public agency contracts are frequently awarded only after formal competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted and typically contain provisions that permit cancellation in the event that funds are unavailable to the public agency. We may not be awarded any of the contracts for which we submit a bid. Even if we are awarded contracts, substantial delays or cancellations of purchases could result from protests initiated by losing bidders.\nOur growth depends on our introduction of new products and services, which may be costly to develop and may not achieve market acceptance.\nAs part of our strategy for growth, we intend to develop products to address additional transportation security scanning opportunities, such as passenger, carry-on baggage and air cargo screening. We also intend to address homeland security requirements beyond aviation, such as screening at border checkpoints, government offices and transportation terminals and ports. We will be required to spend funds to develop or acquire technologies and products for these initiatives and these initiatives may divert our development and management resources away from our core PinPoint\u2122 product. In addition, we have acquired, rather than developed internally, some of our technologies in connection with our acquisitions of companies and businesses, and these technologies may not perform as we expect. The development of new products may require greater time and financial resources than we currently anticipate and, despite significant investments in research and development, may not yield commercially successful products.\nThe development of our products for explosives and weapons detection is highly complex. Successful product development and market acceptance of any new products and services that we develop depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour timely completion and introduction of new products;\n\u00b7\nour accurate prediction of the demand for homeland security products and the changing requirements of the homeland security industry, including certification or other required performance standards;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of key components of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe quality, price and operating performance of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour customer service capabilities and responsiveness; and\n\u00b7\nthe success of our relationships with potential customers.\nOur PinPoint\u2122 product may fail to obtain certification by the Transportation Safety Administration.\nNew products for transportation security scanning applications may require certification or approval by the Transportation Safety Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d), and we believe that the TSA does not currently have standards for the certification of transportation security scanning products other than bulk explosives detection systems and explosives trace detectors, or ETD. Other products, such as metal detectors, are subject to TSA testing prior to approval. Market acceptance of new products may be limited if the TSA has not developed standards for certification or approval of such products, and even if it does develop such standards, we may be unable to obtain any such certification or approval, which could materially limit market acceptance of such products. If we fail to timely introduce new products or if these products fail to gain market acceptance, our results of operations would be harmed.\nIn addition, even if successful in the United States, new products that we develop may not achieve market acceptance outside of the United States. Foreign governments may be unwilling to commit financial resources to purchase our new products, which would reduce our potential revenues and harm our business.\nOur existing PinPoint\u2122 product may fail to obtain re-certification by the TSA for changes in the PinPoint\u2122 system.\nOur existing PinPoint\u2122 product can be required to be re-certified by the TSA. This can happen when a critical component is changed, or we wish to make other changes to the PinPoint\u2122 systems. When this happens, the affected PinPoint\u2122 model requires re-certification by the TSA. The failure or delay in gaining re-certification for an existing PinPoint\u2122 product could harm our ability to continue to sell the product and recognize associated revenues.\nOur major potential customer, the TSA, is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, an agency that has experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in its operations, which may cause delays in our receiving orders for our products from the TSA.\nThe TSA has experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in fulfilling its mandate as a result of ongoing restructuring and establishing necessary infrastructure to operate in an efficient manner. This may result in delays in our receiving orders for our PinPoint\u2122 product. Further, the TSA, being an agency under the Department of Homeland Security, may experience changes in direction from DHS in performing their responsibilities or changes in responsibilities, which may further create delays in doing business with the TSA or DHS.\nFuture sales of our PinPoint\u2122 products will depend on the ability of airports to secure funding to build baggage handling systems and to integrate our PinPoint\u2122 product into such systems, which they may not be able to do.\nFuture sales will depend on integrating PinPoint\u2122 into existing baggage and luggage handling systems within airports. If an airport is not configured for these systems, deployment of our PinPoint\u2122 products may require changes in the airport infrastructure. If our PinPoint\u2122 product cannot easily be integrated into existing baggage handling systems, we may experience reduced sales of our PinPoint\u2122 products or these sales may be delayed. There can be no assurance that the government will continue to fund installations, integrations and reimbursements at the current level or at all. If there is a reduction in funding, we may experience reduced sales of our PinPoint\u2122 products or these sales may be delayed.\nWe believe that a substantial opportunity exists for our PinPoint\u2122 system to be integrated into baggage handling systems. If airports determine, in conjunction with governmental authorities, that they will be unable or unwilling to modify or finance baggage handling systems, this opportunity may be limited.\nIf our PinPoint\u2122 product fails to detect explosives, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage, and we may lose current and potential customers.\nOur transportation security scanning business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the development, sale and maintenance of transportation security scanning products. Our software is not designed to detect, and FAA/TSA certification does not require, 100% detection of any and all explosives contained in scanned baggage. For this reason, or if our products malfunction, it is possible that explosive material could pass undetected utilizing our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customer\u2019s operators and the training of the operators. Such liability claims are likely to exceed any product liability insurance that we may have obtained.\nIn addition, the failure of any PinPoint\u2122 product to detect explosives, even if due to operator error and not to the mechanical failure of a PinPoint\u2122 product, could result in public and customer perception that our products do not work effectively, which may cause potential customers to not place orders and current customers to cancel orders already placed or to not place additional orders, any of which would harm our business and financial results.\nWe expect to substantially depend on large orders from a limited number of customers. As a result, order cancellations from any of our customers or the failure of these customers to continue to purchase PinPoint\u2122 products could have a material negative impact on our business and financial results.\nIn any given fiscal quarter or year, our revenues may be derived from orders of multiple units of our PinPoint\u2122 product from a limited number of customers. The failure of these customers, particularly the U.S. government, to purchase our PinPoint\u2122 products or the cancellation of future orders would harm our business.\nThe sales cycle for our PinPoint\u2122 product is lengthy and we may expend a significant amount of effort in obtaining sales orders and not receive them.\nThe sales cycle of our PinPoint\u2122 product is expected to be lengthy due to the protracted approval process that typically accompanies large capital expenditures and the time required to install our PinPoint\u2122 product. In addition, in the United States, the creation of the TSA and formation of a Department of Homeland Security, as well as budgetary debates in Congress, may result in additional delays in the purchase of our PinPoint\u2122 products. During the sales cycle we may expend substantial funds and management resources but recognize no associated revenue.\nOur future international sales subject us to risks that could materially harm our business.\nIt is part of our growth strategy to establish international sales. A number of factors related to our international sales and operations could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability in the countries where we sell products;\n\u00b7\npossible foreign currency controls;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to protect and utilize our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ntariffs, embargoes or other barriers;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in obtaining and managing distributors; and\n\u00b7\npotentially negative tax consequences.\nOur failure to obtain the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations, may affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the United States, which could harm our business. In particular, our PinPoint\u2122 product may be deemed regulated and subject to export restrictions under the U.S. Department of State regulations. Consequently, these regulations may make the product more difficult to sell to a number of countries. Compliance with government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nExchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2014, the cost of certain international currencies has decreased, yet such costs may later increase, due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Euro or other currencies. Future fluctuations in this exchange rate or other currencies could adversely affect our results in the event we make foreign sales of our products. From time to time, as and when we determine it is appropriate and advisable to do so, we will seek to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. We cannot assure you, however, that we will continue this practice or be successful in these efforts.\nOur inability to adapt to rapid technological change could impair our ability to remain competitive.\nThe transportation security scanning industry may undergo significant technological development in response to increased demand for transportation security scanning products. A fundamental shift in technology in our product markets could harm our ability to generate revenues from sales of PinPoint\u2122 product and services.\nWe anticipate that we will incur expenses in the design and initial development and marketing of new products and services. Our competitors may implement new technologies before we are able to, allowing them to provide more effective products at more competitive prices. Future technological developments could:\n\u00b7\nadversely impact our competitive position;\n\u00b7\nrequire write-downs of obsolete technology;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to discontinue production of obsolete products before we can recover any or all of our related research, development and commercialization expenses; or\n\u00b7\nrequire significant capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated.\nWe cannot assure investors that we will be able to achieve the technological advances to remain competitive and profitable, that new products and services will be developed and developed on schedule or on a cost-effective basis that anticipated markets will exist or develop for new products or services, or that our existing product and services will not become technologically obsolete.\nThe transportation security scanning industry is highly competitive. Given the anticipated continuing demand for airport security products, competition may increase.\nThe transportation security scanning industry is intensely competitive and we may not compete successfully. As a result of increased demand for security systems, additional companies may enter the industry. Some of our competitors, and many of the potential new entrants into the transportation security scanning industry, have financial, technical, production and other resources substantially greater than ours. We believe that some of our competitors have products undergoing TSA certification. Our failure to compete successfully could result in lost sales and could hamper our financial results.\nWe expect to become reliant upon third party distributors for the distribution and licensing of our PinPoint\u2122 and Signature Mapping\u2122 products in several domestic or foreign jurisdictions, and have reduced our reliance upon our own internal sales force.\nWe have established and continue to seek to establish a network of distributors, sales representatives and consultants to assist us in the distribution and licensing of our products domestically and in certain foreign countries, including those business relationships\nestablished prior to 2013. Such distributors, sales representatives and consultants have not effected any sales of our PinPoint\u2122, or Signature Mapping\u2122 products to date and we have no assurance they will be able to effect any such sales in the future. We continue to review sales activities under certain of such arrangements and, as our agreements with such third parties expire, we may determine not to renew or we may terminate such agreements, or establish new relationships.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce or defend against claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could prevent us from selling our products.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of the outcome, could be costly and require significant time and attention of key members of our management and technical personnel.\nOur domestic and international competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to manufacture and sell our products. We have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties. Because of the perceived market opportunity we face, companies possessing technology rights that they believe we might be infringing will now be much more motivated to assert infringement of their rights. These third parties may assert infringement or invalidity claims against us and litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease selling our products. Even successful defenses of patent suits can be costly and time-consuming.", "PERMNO": 83663, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "APVS"}
