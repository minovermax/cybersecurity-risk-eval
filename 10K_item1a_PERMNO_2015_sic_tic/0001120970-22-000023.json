{"cik": "1120970", "company": "Comstock Mining Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThere are many important factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our business, including, but not limited to the factors discussed below, which should be reviewed carefully together with other information contained in this report. Some of the factors are beyond our control and future trends are difficult to predict.\nAn investment in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in evaluating our Company, its business, its industry and prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on us. The following risks could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATING RISKS\nYou may lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we are unable to generate cash flows from our planned operating activities in our renewable energy products segment, then it is unlikely that the cash generated from our strategic and other investments segment will suffice as a source of the liquidity necessary for anticipated working capital requirements. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s initiatives to improve its liquidity and financial position will be successful. Accordingly, there is substantial risk that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern. In the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, the Company\u2019s creditors would be entitled to payment in full out of the Company\u2019s assets before holders of common stock would be entitled to any payment, and the claims on such assets may exceed the value of such assets.\nWe have a limited operating history.\nWe have a limited operating history. The success of our Company is significantly dependent on the completion of uncertain future events, including the financing, development, permitting, construction, commissioning, start-up, and initiation of sustainable throughput of our planned cellulosic fuels and electrification metals production facilities, the discovery and exploitation of mineralized materials on our properties, selling the rights to exploit those materials, and/or commercializing our other diversified production and processing activities. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, then our securities may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company.\nWe may never earn significant revenues from our operations.\nIf we are unable to generate significant revenues from our planned production and processing activities in the future, then we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. We have yet to generate positive operating income and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful, our business will fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth.\nEven if we can successfully implement our growth strategy, any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We intend to expand operations significantly by 2030, which will require us to hire and train new employees; accurately forecast supply and demand, production and revenue; control expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations; establish new production facilities; and implement and enhance administrative infrastructure, systems and processes. Future growth may also be tied to acquisitions, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively acquire other businesses or integrate businesses that we acquire. Failure to efficiently manage any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all.\nOur future global growth, results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our ability to: economically extract and refine wasted and unused natural resources and meet customers\u2019 business needs; complete the construction of future facilities at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis; invest and keep pace in technology, research and development efforts, and the expansion and defense of our intellectual property portfolio; secure and maintain required strategic supply arrangements; effectively compete in the markets in which we operate; and, attract and retain management or other employees with specialized knowledge and technical skills. There can be no assurance that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above initiatives in the manner or time period that we expect. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments that may result in both short-term and long-term costs without generating any current revenue and therefore may be dilutive to earnings. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect to generate from our growth strategy. Failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are exposed to global health, economic, supply chain, and market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements.\nThe outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, specifically identified as COVID-19, has resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. These measures, including the implementation of travel bans, quarantine periods and social distancing, have caused material disruptions to global business and an economic downturn. Global equity markets have experienced significant volatility and weakness. Governments and their central banks have reacted with significant fiscal and monetary interventions designed to mitigate the impacts and stabilize economic conditions. Attempts at containment of COVID-19 resulted in decreased economic activity and adversely affected the broader global economy. At this time, the full extent to which COVID-19 will negatively impact the global economy and our business is uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events will most likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. It is not currently possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of these delays and the impact on the Company's financial condition, and that of its subsidiaries and partners in future periods.\nFurther, uncertainties regarding the global economic and financial environment could lead to an extended national or global economic recession. A slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce demand for assets that we hold for sale and result in lower commodity prices for long periods of time. Costs of exploration, development and production have not yet adjusted to current economic conditions, or in proportion to the significant reduction in product prices. Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies needed for our planned developments could result in occasional shortages of supplies of certain products, equipment or materials. There is no guarantee we will be able to obtain certain products, equipment and/or materials as and when needed, without interruption, or on favorable terms, if at all. Such delays could affect our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses.\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal law requiring the consumption of qualifying renewable fuels, could be repealed, curtailed or otherwise changed, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating margins and financial condition.\nWe and other participants in the biomass-based diesel industry rely on governmental programs requiring or incentivizing the consumption of biofuels. Biomass-based diesel has historically been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel fuel and these governmental programs support a market for biomass-based diesel that might not otherwise exist. One of the most important of these programs is the RFS II, a federal law that requires that transportation fuels in the United States contain a minimum amount of renewable fuel. This program is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The EPA's authority includes setting annual minimum aggregate levels of consumption in four renewable fuel categories, including the two primary categories in which we plan to compete, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel. The parties obligated to comply with this RVO, are petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers. The petroleum industry is strongly opposed to the RFS II and can be expected to continue to press for changes both in the RFS II itself and in the way that it is administered by the EPA. For 2022, the advanced biofuel RVO has been set at 5.04 billion gallons. For The U.S. Congress could repeal, curtail or otherwise change the RFS II program in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, the EPA could curtail or otherwise change its administration of the RFS II program in a manner adverse to us, including by not increasing or even decreasing the RVO, by waiving compliance with the RVO or otherwise. In addition, while Congress specified RFS II volume requirements through 2022 (subject to adjustment in the rule-making process), beginning in 2023 required volumes of renewable fuel will be largely at the discretion of the EPA (in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Agriculture). We cannot predict what changes, if any, will be instituted or the impact of any changes on our business, although adverse changes could seriously harm our revenues, earnings and financial condition.\nLoss of or reductions in federal and state government tax incentives for renewable fuel production or consumption may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins.\nFederal and state tax incentives have assisted the biomass-based diesel industry by making the price of biomass-based diesel more cost competitive with the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel to the end user. The most significant tax incentive program has been the federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, referred to as the Biodiesel Tax Credit (\"BTC\"). Under the BTC, the first person to blend pure biomass-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel receives a $1.00-per-gallon refundable tax credit. Unlike the RFS II program, the BTC has a direct effect on federal government spending and changes in federal budget policy could result in its elimination or in changes to its terms that are less beneficial to us. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress may take with respect to the BTC in the future. There is no assurance that the BTC will be reinstated, that it will be reinstated on the same terms or, if reinstated, that its application will be retroactive, prospective or both. Any adverse changes in the BTC can be expected to harm our results of operations and financial condition. Several states have enacted tax incentives for the use of biodiesel. Modification, curtailment or elimination of such incentives could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe intend to derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our renewable fuel in states with Low Carbon Fuel Standards, however, adverse changes in the associated laws or reductions in the value of the applicable credits would harm our revenues and profits.\nThe LCFS is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California by ensuring that the total amount of fuel consumed meets declining targets for such emissions. The regulation quantifies lifecycle GHG emissions by assigning a carbon intensity (\"CI\") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel\u2019s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider, generally the fuel\u2019s producer or importer is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. This obligation is tracked through credits and deficits and credits can be traded. We expect to receive LCFS credits when we eventually sell qualified fuels in California and other applicable states and jurisdictions. If the value of our planned renewable fuels were to materially decrease as a result of over-supply or reduced demand for our fuels, or if our fuel is deemed not to qualify for LCFS credits, or if the LCFS or the manner in which it is administered or applied were otherwise changed in a manner adverse to us, then our revenues and profits could be seriously harmed.\nA decline in the adoption rate of renewable energy or electrification, or a decline in the support by governments for renewable energy and electrification technologies, could materially harm our financial results and ability to grow our business.\nThe demand for our renewable energy products, process solutions, related services, and technology licensing is driven in part by projected increases in the demand for renewable energy and electrification. A decline in the adoption of renewable energy and electrification could reduce the demand for our renewable energy products, process solutions, related services, and technology licensing, which could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur success will depend on acquiring, maintaining, and increasing feedstock supply commitments, as well as securing new customers and offtake agreements.\nWe must acquire and maintain feedstock supply commitments as well as new customers, including offtake agreements. Feedstock suppliers may change or delay supply contracts for any number of reasons, such as force majeure or government approval factors that are unrelated to our operations. Customers may fail to perform under their contracts for similar reasons. As a result, in order to maintain and expand our business, we must continue to develop and obtain new feedstock supply and customer contracts. However, it is difficult to predict whether and when we will secure such commitments and/or contracts due to competition for suppliers and customers and the lengthy process of negotiating supplier and customer agreements, which may be affected by factors that we do not control, such as market and economic conditions, financing arrangements, commodity prices, environmental issues and government approvals.\nOur margins will be dependent on the spread between the market prices for our renewable energy products and the costs for our feedstocks, which may be volatile and can cause our results of operations to fluctuate substantially.\nOur business will be highly impacted by commodity price volatility, primarily in the markets for our intended renewable energy products, including carbon neutral cellulosic oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, marine fuel, lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, aluminum, gold, silver, and other commodity-driven renewable energy products. While our technologies target and benefit from low cost wasted and unused feedstocks, decreases in the prevailing prices for our renewable energy products will have a negative impact on the amount of cash we are able to produce from our operating activities. Any such decreases may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations depend on the availability of sufficient water supplies.\nSome of our planned operations will require significant quantities of water for extraction, processing and related support facilities, and some of our planned operations are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous operation at such locations will be dependent on our ability to secure and maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water.\nOwning property and water rights and options on property and water rights carries inherent risks.\nAs a result of our ownership of real property and water rights, our business may be negatively affected by related risks beyond our control, including without limitation: adverse changes in national, regional and local economic conditions and outlook; economic downturns in the areas where the properties are located; adverse changes in local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply of properties, reduction in demand, intense competition for buyers and/or demographic changes; changes in business or consumer preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties; changes in zoning, regulatory restrictions or tax laws; and, changes in interest rates or availability of financing. These conditions could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, or the market price of our stock.\nWe do not have proven or probable reserves, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals and metals we produce will be sufficient to recover our investment and operating costs.\nWe do not have proven or probable reserves. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties with established reserves or to establish proven or probable reserves through drilling, analysis and engineering. Any sums expended for additional drilling, analysis and engineering may not establish proven or probable reserves on our properties. We drill in connection with our mineral exploration and mining activities and not with the purpose of establishing proven and probable reserves. While we estimate the amount of mineralized material we believe exists on our properties, our calculations are subject to uncertainty due to several factors, including the quantity and grade of the mineralized material, metal prices and recoverability of minerals in the mineral recovery process. There is a great degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of any mineralized material, particularly where there has not been significant drilling, mining and processing. Until the mineralized material located on our properties is actually mined and processed, the quantity and quality of the mineralized material must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the estimated value of such mineralized material (regardless of the\nquantity) will vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the estimated value of mineralized material may negatively affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the same recoveries of metals contained in the mineralized material as in small-scale laboratory tests, or that we will be able to duplicate such results in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. There can be no assurance that our exploration activities will result in the discovery of sufficient quantities of mineralized material to recover our investment and operating costs.\nThe cost of our exploration, development and acquisition activities is substantial, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals and metals we discover, acquire or recover will justify commercial operations or replace future reserves.\nMineral exploration, development and beneficiation, particularly for gold, silver and other strategic metals, is highly speculative in nature and frequently is nonproductive. There can be no assurance that our exploration, development and/or acquisition activities will be commercially successful. If gold mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties, to establish mineral reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the mineralized material and, in the case of new properties, to develop the processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mineral exploration. There can be no assurance that any gold reserves or mineralized material that may be discovered or acquired in the future, if any, will be in sufficient quantities or of adequate grade to justify commercial operations, or that the funds required for mineral production operation can be obtained on a timely or reasonable basis, if at all. Mining companies must continually replace mineralized material or reserves depleted by production. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in replacing any reserves or mineralized material acquired or established in the future.\nEstimates costs and timing are uncertain, which may adversely affect our expected production and profitability.\nThe capital expenditures and time required to acquire, develop and explore our projects are considerable and changes in costs, construction schedules or both, can adversely affect project economics and expected production and profitability. There are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules, including, among others:\n-\navailability of labor, energy, transportation, equipment, and infrastructure;\n-\nchanges in input commodity prices and labor costs;\n-\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n-\navailability and terms of financing;\n-\nchanges in anticipated tonnage, grade and characteristics of the mineralized material to be mined and processed;\n-\nrecovery rates of gold and other metals from mineralized or recyclable materials;\n-\ndifficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of a year;\n-\ndelays in completing any environmental review or in obtaining environmental or other government permits;\n-\nweather and severe climate impacts; and\n-\npotential delays related to health, social, political and community issues.\nResource and other material statements are estimates subject to uncertainty due to factors including market prices, and the inherent variability and recoverability of targeted natural resources in extraction and beneficiation processes.\nOur reports of mineral resources, other mineralized material and grading are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of mineral resources and corresponding grades. Until mineral resources and other mineralized materials are actually mined and processed, the quantity of mineralized material and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineral resources and other mineralized materials may vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the quantity of mineral resources, other mineralized materials, mineralization, grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, we can\nprovide no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries experienced in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\nMarket prices fluctuate and a downturn in price could negatively impact our operations and cash flow.\nOur operations will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of metals and minerals that we are able to produce or extract. Commodity prices can fluctuate widely and may be affected by numerous factors, such as expectations for inflation, levels of interest rates, currency exchange rates, purchases and sales by governments and central banks, monetary policies employed by the world\u2019s major central banks, fiscal policies employed by the world\u2019s major industrialized economies, forward selling or other hedging activities, demand, global or regional political and economic crises, and production costs in other regions. The aggregate effect of these factors, all of which are beyond our control, is impossible for us to predict. If prices decline substantially, it could adversely affect the realizable value of our assets and, potentially, future results of operations and cash flow.\nRisk management transactions could significantly increase our operating costs and may not be effective.\nIn an attempt to partially offset the effects of market price volatility, we may enter into contracts that establish market positions in feedstocks and offtakes, along with related commodities, such as heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel. The financial impact of such market positions depends on commodity prices at the time that we are required to perform our obligations under these contracts as well as the cumulative sum of the obligations we assume under these contracts. Risk management activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss where the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded or over-the-counter futures or options contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual prices paid or received by us. Changes in the value of these futures (derivative financial instruments) would result in risk management gains and losses that would be recognized in current income and may result in margin calls. If adverse changes in derivative instrument fair value were to occur, a significant amount of liquidity would be needed to fund margin calls. In addition, we may also vary the amount of risk management strategies we undertake, or we may choose not to engage in risk management transactions at all. Our results of operation may be negatively impacted if we are not able to manage our risk management strategy effectively.\nIn addition to changes in prevailing commodity prices, our results of operations could be significantly affected by the volume, mix, and composition of the various wasted and unused natural resource feedstocks that we are targeting, all of which are subject to variance.\nOur revenues will depend on processing wasted and unused natural resources, and our revenues will be directly impacted by the chemistry of the feedstocks we acquire and process, particularly as market chemistries shift. Certain feedstock chemistries produce raw materials such as cobalt for which we receive higher prices than others. A decline in overall volume of feedstock processed, or a decline in volume of chemistries with higher priced content relative to other chemistries, could result in a significant decline in our revenues, which in turn would have a material impact on its results of operations.\nIf one or more of our facilities become inoperative, capacity constrained, or if operations are disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenue will be dependent on the continued operations of our planned future cellulosic fuels and electrification metals facilities, as well as other future facilities that we develop in the future. To the extent that we experience any operational risk including, among other things, fire and explosions, severe weather and natural disasters (such as floods and hurricanes), failures in water supply, major power failures, equipment failures (including any failure of information technology, air conditioning, and cooling and compressor systems), failures to comply with applicable regulations and standards, labor force and work stoppages, including those resulting from local or global pandemics or otherwise, or if current or future facilities become capacity constrained, we may be required to make capital expenditures even though we may not have sufficient available resources at such time. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the proceeds available from our insurance policies will be sufficient to cover such capital expenditures. Our insurance coverage and available resources may prove to be inadequate for events that may cause significant disruption to our operations. Any disruption in our production facilities could result in delivery delays, scheduling problems, increased costs or production interruption, which, in turn, may result in its customers deciding to send their feedstock to our competitors. We will be dependent on our current and future facilities, which will in the future require a high degree of capital expenditures. If one or more of our facilities becomes inoperative, capacity constrained,\nor if operations are disrupted, then our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n-\nenvironmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;\n-\nindustrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems, and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling, processing and transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials;\n-\nsurface or underground fires or floods;\n-\nunexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n-\nground and water conditions;\n-\nfall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;\n-\nfailure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls\n-\nseismic activity; and\n-\nother natural phenomena, such as lightning, rain, snowstorms, floods, or other inclement weather conditions\nOur facilities and our customers' facilities will be subject to risks associated with fire, explosions, leaks, and natural disasters, which may disrupt our business and increase costs and liabilities.\nOur current and planned operating activities are inherently hazardous. Operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to extraction and refining of wasted and unused natural resources into renewable energy products, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property and possible environmental damage. The nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any applicable liability insurance policy limits. It is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or we could elect not to insure ourselves against such liabilities because of the high premium costs, in which event, we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Because some of our inputs and outputs will be combustible and/or flammable, a leak, fire or explosion may occur at a plant or customer\u2019s facility which could result in damage to the plant and nearby properties, injury or death to employees and others, and interruption of operations. The operations at our facilities are also subject to the risk of natural disasters. An earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our ability to transport, store and deliver products to California. Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty. The Company's operations could be exposed to a number of physical risks from climate change, such as changes in rainfall rates, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, higher temperatures, fire and other extreme weather events. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change. If we experience a fire or other serious incident at our facilities or if any of our facilities is affected by a natural disaster, we may incur significant additional costs, including, loss of profits due to unplanned temporary or permanent shutdowns of our facilities, loss of the ability to transport products or increased costs to do so, cleanup costs, liability for damages or injuries, legal and reconstruction expenses. The occurrence of significant additional costs would harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe dangers inherent in storage and transportation of our renewable energy products could cause disruptions in our operations and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nWe intend to store our renewable energy products, including renewable fuels, in above ground storage tanks and transport fuel with third-party truck and rail carriers. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in transporting and storing fuel. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, accidents, fires, explosions, spills, discharges, and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims, and other damage to property. Any such event not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in transportation costs or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business will depend on transportation services. The costs of these transportation services are affected by the volatility in fuel prices or other factors, such as tank car availability and prices. If oil production from this area increases, the demand for rail cars will rise and will significantly increase rail car prices. We may not be able to pass along part or all of any of these price increases to customers. If we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected. If any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed and any such delay or failure could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather interruptions may affect and delay proposed operations and impact our business plans.\nExtreme weather events (such as increased frequency or intensity of storms or prolonged drought, flooded or frozen terrain) have the potential to disrupt operations at our projects. Extended disruptions to supply lines due to extreme weather could result in interruption of activities at the project sites, delay or increase the cost of construction of the projects, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nDisruptions in the supply of certain key inputs and components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nThe production of our products in the future may require a wide variety of raw materials, key inputs and components and other. Such critical raw materials, key inputs and components and other goods may only be available from limited or single sources of supply. If the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n-\nnegotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n-\nthe inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n-\nreduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n-\nfailure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n-\ninterruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n-\nfailure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and,\n-\nproblems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues,\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and expect that competition will increase.\nWe compete with other renewable fuels, electrification metals, clean technology engineering and licensing, and mineral exploration and mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties and other assets, feedstock and offtake agreements, and clients, and the attraction and retention of human capital. Those competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do.\nOur renewable energy products segment will face competition from producers and suppliers of fossil fuels, and producers, marketers, traders, and distributors of renewable fuels. Our cellulosic ethanol products will compete with ethanol produced by the highly fragmented U.S. corn ethanol industry, including from plants owned by farmers, cooperatives, oil refiners and retail fuel operators that may continue to operate even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we will compete with independent biomass-based diesel producers, as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. There are also major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial, feedstock sourcing and marketing resources that make renewable fuel as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We will also compete with several large and well capitalized producers of renewable diesel. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with us, either by converting oil refineries to produce renewable diesel or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Several petroleum refiners in the U.S. have effected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables in the past year. Some of the largest refiners have started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation.\nOur renewable energy products segment operates in the LIB recycling industry, where it faces competition primarily from companies that focus on one type of recycling, some of which have more expertise in the recycling of that material than we do. We also compete against companies that have a substantial competitive advantage because of longer operating histories and larger budgets, as well as greater financial and other resources. National or global competitors could enter the market with more substantial financial and workforce resources, stronger existing customer relationships, and greater name recognition, or could choose to target medium to small companies in our markets. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing more efficient recovery solutions than us. Competition also places downward pressure on contract prices and profit margins, which presents significant challenges to maintaining growth rates and acceptable margins. Such factors would materially harm our operations, cash flows and profitability.\nTechnological advances could render some or all our plans obsolete and adversely affect our ability to compete.\nAdvances in the process of converting wasted and unused natural resources could allow our competitors to produce renewable energy products faster and more efficiently and at a substantially lower cost. In addition, we will produce our renewable fuels to conform to or exceed standards established by the American Society for Testing and Materials, whose standards may be modified in response to new technologies from the industries involved with diesel fuel. New standards or production technologies may require us to make additional capital investments in, or modify, plant operations to meet these standards. We will be required to continually enhance and update our technology to maintain its efficacy and to avoid obsolescence. The costs of doing so may be substantial and may be higher than the costs that we anticipate for technology maintenance and development. If we are unable to adapt or incorporate technological advances into our operations, our production facilities could become less competitive or obsolete, or our ability to manage our business and to compete may be impaired. Further, it may be necessary for us to make significant expenditures to acquire any new technology, acquire licenses or other rights to technology and retrofit our plants in order to remain competitive. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such technologies, licenses or rights on favorable terms. Even if we are able to maintain technical effectiveness, our technology may not be the most efficient means of reaching our objectives, in which case we may incur higher operating costs than we would if our technology were more effective. The impact of technical shortcomings could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain, implement or finance new technologies, our production facilities could be less efficient, and our ability to produce biomass-based diesel on a competitive level may be harmed, negatively impacting our revenues and profitability.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or others assert that our operations violate their intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the U.S. and in select foreign countries to protect our intellectual property. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret\nprotection may be unavailable, limited or not obtained in some countries. Our success may depend on our ability to successfully prosecute and/or maintain and enforce patent and other intellectual property protection for our technologies. We have obtained or developed rights to patents and patent applications in the U.S. and on a case by case basis internationally, and may, in the future, seek rights from third parties to other patent applications or patented technology. There can be no assurance, however, that patents will issue from the patent applications filed or to be filed or that the scope of any claims granted in any patent will provide us with proprietary protection. If the scope of the claim granted in a patent is not sufficient to afford us with protection against competitors with similar technology, our investment in the patented technology may provide us limited or no competitive advantage. Any failure to maintain patent or other intellectual property protection on our technologies could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position. We also rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our knowhow, confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. For example, we require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that knowhow and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, these agreements may be breached, expire, or may not be enforceable, and our proprietary information may be disclosed. Despite the existence of these agreements, third parties may independently develop equivalent proprietary information and techniques. It may be difficult to protect and enforce our intellectual property. Adverse judicial decision(s) in any legal action could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit our ability to develop new products, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. A competitor could seek to enforce intellectual property claims against us. Defending intellectual property claims asserted against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty payments. Further, a third-party claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages limits our operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate and to manage transitions to new product innovations.\nTechnology requirements in our markets are constantly advancing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers\u2019 requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business.\nWe may not be successful in developing our new products and services.\nOur success will depend partially on our ability to introduce new products, services and technologies continually and on a timely basis and to continue to improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services in response to both evolving demands of prospective customers and competitive products. There can be no assurance that any of our new or proposed products or services will maintain the market acceptance already established. Our failure to design, develop, test, market and introduce new and enhanced products, technologies and services successfully so as to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products and services, or that our new products and services will adequately satisfy the requirements of prospective customers and achieve significant acceptance by those customers. Because of certain market characteristics, including technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards, the continued introduction of new products and services is critical. Delays in the introduction of new products and services may result in customer dissatisfaction and may delay or cause a loss of revenue. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or services or improving existing products and services that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards. In addition, new or enhanced products and services introduced by us may contain undetected errors that require significant design modifications. This could result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect the use of our products, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nOur research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n-\nchanging product specifications and customer requirements;\n-\ninability to manufacture new products cost effectively;\n-\ndifficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations;\n-\nchanging market or competitive product requirements; and,\n-\nunanticipated engineering complexities.\nNew products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, and have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be difficulty in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful. Any of these adverse developments could harm our business and our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to commercially release products that are accepted in the market or that generate significant revenues, our financial results will continue to suffer.\nThere can be no assurances that demand for our future products will meet, or even approach, our expectations. In addition, our pricing and marketing strategies may not be successful. Lack of customer demand, a change in marketing strategy and changes to our pricing models could dramatically alter our financial results. Unless we are able to release products and sell services that meet a significant market demand, we will not be able to improve our financial condition or the results of our future operations.\nProduct defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors\u2019 products may seriously harm our business and reputation.\nWe plan to produce complex products that may contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate products that we plan to produce with products of other vendors\u2019 products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues.\nWe may encounter manufacturing or assembly problems for products, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo date, our strategic joint venture partners have only manufactured prototypes and a limited number of products. In addition, they are continually redesigning and enhancing products and we are designing new products based on that technology that we hope to market in the near future. The manufacture and assembly of such products involves complex and precise processes, some of which are totally dependent on other companies and consultants. There is no assurance that the strategic joint venture partners will not encounter any serious problems in the production of existing or new products. Any significant problems in manufacturing, assembling or testing products could delay the sales of products and have an adverse impact on our business and prospects. The willingness of manufacturers to make the product, or lack of availability of manufacturing capacity, may have an adverse impact on the availability of products and on the ability to sell products. Manufacturing difficulties will harm the ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may hinder our ability to grow our business as we expect.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations and timelines may be affected by global economic markets and levels of consumer comfort and spend, including recessions, slow economic growth, economic and pricing instability, increase of interest rates and credit market volatility, all of which could impact demand in the worldwide transportation industries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Because the impact of current conditions on an ongoing basis is yet largely unknown, rapidly evolving, and varied across geographic regions, an ongoing assessment will be particularly critical to allow us to accurately project supply and demand and infrastructure requirements globally and allocate resources accordingly. If current global market conditions continue or worsen, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nNatural disasters, unusually adverse weather, epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, boycotts and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, unusually adverse weather, epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, boycotts and geopolitical events, such as civil unrest and acts of terrorism, or similar disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, power supply, results of operations or financial condition. These events could result in physical damage to property, an increase in energy prices, temporary or permanent closure of one or more of our planned facilities, temporary lack of an adequate workforce in a market, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of raw materials, construction delays at our planned facilities, temporary disruption in transport from overseas, or disruption to our information systems. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of its control, which could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nIlliquidity of investments and assets could impede our ability to respond to changes in economic and other conditions.\nOur short-term plans include the sale of non-strategic and other investments and assets. The success of these plans depends on the market prices and demand for the purchase of such investments and assets. We may not be able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of these investments and assets to pay off our indebtedness or offset our other liquidity needs. Our ability to sell one or more of our investments or assets in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of our investments or assets for the price or terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective buyer would be acceptable to us.\nWe also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing buyer and to the close the sale of an investments or assets. The applicable markets are affected by many factors that are beyond our control. The nature of our properties, including our held-for-sale properties, may make it difficult for us to sell or develop those properties and could require considerable, additional capital to adapt the properties for sale or other productive uses, and could negatively affect our financial performance, including as a result of the following factors:\n-\nTime required to complete a sale or development may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity.\n-\nOur water rights or the availability of water through wells or municipal water providers may not be adequate to support potential development.\n-\nWater rights sales values are highly volatile.\n-\nWe may encounter other delays as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters, material shortages, and regulatory requirements.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding.\nThe construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments and fund our ongoing business activities. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future commodity and other market prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower commodity and other market prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations, and retire or service all of our outstanding debt could be significantly constrained.\nNevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n-\nthe right of the board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n-\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n-\nthe ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n-\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Nevada, we are governed by Nevada Revised Statutes 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive. These provisions may also have an effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of us. A corporation affected by these provisions may not engage in a combination within two years after the interested stockholder acquires his, her or its shares unless the combination or purchase is approved by the board of directors before the interested stockholder acquired such shares. Generally, if approval is not obtained, then after the expiration of the two-year period, the business combination may be consummated with the approval of the board of directors before the person became an interested stockholder or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders, or if the consideration to be received per share by disinterested stockholders is at least equal to the highest of: (i) the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or within three years immediately before, or in, the transaction in which he, she or it became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher; (ii) the market value per share on the date of announcement of the combination or the date the person became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher; or (iii) if higher for the holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock, if any. Generally, these provisions define an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation, and define \u201ccombination\u201d to include any merger or consolidation with an interested stockholder, or any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions with an interested stockholder of assets of the corporation: (i) having an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation; (ii) having an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation; or (iii) representing 10% or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation.. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Nevada law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur operations are subject to strict environmental laws and regulations, including regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change, which could result in added costs of operations and operational delays, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to strict environmental regulations, which could result in additional costs and operational delays. All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental legislation is evolving in the United States generally, and Nevada specifically, in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, and employees. There is no assurance that any future changes in environmental regulation will not negatively affect our projects. At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (\"NDEP\"). Nevada state law requires our Nevada projects to hold Nevada water pollution control permits, which dictate operating controls and closure and post-closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water. In addition, we are required to hold Nevada reclamation permits required under Nevada law. These permits mandate concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Other Nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and\nregulations could have a negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or surety requirements.\nFailure to comply with governmental regulations, including EPA requirements relating to RFS II or new laws designed to deal with climate change, could result in the imposition of higher costs, penalties, fines, or restrictions on our operations and remedial liabilities.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, and we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, and regardless of whether current or prior operations were conducted consistent with the accepted standards of practice. In addition, we will be subject to similar laws and regulations in Europe and Canada for the renewable energy products we sell there. Compliance with these laws, regulations and obligations could require substantial capital expenditures. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and changes resulting in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance. Climate change continues to attract considerable attention globally. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and transportation of biofuel products and emission of GHGs. The potential effects of GHG emission limits on our business are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, and the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase our costs of operating and could require us to make significant financial expenditures that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. We are subject to various laws and regulations including RFS II, BTC, LCFS, and other jurisdictions. These regulations are highly complex and continuously evolving, requiring us to periodically update our systems to maintain compliance, which could require significant expenditures. In 2014, the EPA issued a final rule to establish a quality assurance program and the EPA also implemented regulations related to the generation and sale of RINs. Any violation of these regulations by us, could result in significant fines and harm our customers\u2019 confidence in the RINs we issue, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to execute our strategic plans depends upon our success in obtaining a variety of required governmental approvals that may be opposed by third parties.\nWe do not possess all of the governmental approvals necessary to conduct the full extent of the operations contemplated by our strategic plan. Those operations will be delayed, hindered or prevented to the extent that we are unable to obtain the necessary permits and approvals in a timely fashion or at all. This inability may occur due to a variety of factors, including opposition by third parties, such as members of the public or environmental groups. We expect that future permit and approval applications and issuances will meet with similar opposition. We may encounter delays and added costs if permits and approvals are challenged.\nClosure, reclamation, and rehabilitation costs could be higher than expected, and our insurance and surety bonds for environmental-related issues are limited.\nClosure and reclamation work to return operating sites to the community can be extensive and costly. Estimated costs are provided for, and updated annually, over the life of each operation, but the provisions might prove to be inadequate due to changes in legislation, standards and the emergence of new, or increases in the cost of, reclamation techniques. In addition, the expected timing of expenditure could change significantly due to changes in the business environment that might vary the life of an operation. Our insurance and surety bonds against environmental risks are limited as to the maximum protection against potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production. Further, there is no assurance that insurance carriers or surety bond providers will be able to meet their obligations under our arrangements with them. In the event that our environmental liabilities and costs exceed the coverage provided by our insurance carriers and surety bond providers, or such parties are unable to meet their obligations, we would have limited funds available to us to remedy such liabilities or costs, or for future operations. If we are unable to fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we also might be required to enter into an interim compliance measure pending completion of the required remedy.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that require environmental assessments and the posting of bonds, which add significant costs to our operations and delays in our projects.\nMining companies must post a bond or other surety to guarantee the cost of post-mining reclamation. These requirements could add significant additional cost and delays to any mining project undertaken by us. Our mineral exploration operations are required to be covered by reclamation bonds deemed adequate by regulators to cover these risks. BLM requires that mining operations on lands subject to its regulation obtain an approved plan of operations subject to environmental impact evaluation under the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"). Any submission or significant modification to a plan of operations may also require the completion of an environmental assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") prior to approval.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is an energy-intensive undertaking, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. Legislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compete.\nBecause our land holdings are within the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site, our operations are subject to certain soil sampling and potential remediation requirements, which may result in added costs and delays; and we are also potentially subject to further costs as the result of on-going government investigation and future remediation decisions.\nSubstantially all of our land holdings are within the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site (\"CRMS\") Study Area and portions are within the risk area boundaries identified by NDEP and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). These risk areas have been defined due to the known or suspected presence of certain contaminants of concern, including mercury, arsenic and lead. To comply with the agencies\u2019 requirements in these areas, the Company conducts soil sampling pursuant to a plan that has been approved by NDEP. This sampling is intended to demonstrate the absence of contamination before mining, processing or other operations in that area. If contamination above agency-established levels of concern is encountered, the Company intends to excavate and process such materials for metals recovery wherever feasible. If metals recovery is not feasible, the Company may avoid or defer excavating in that area, remove the materials for disposal, or cover the area with clean fill material. Through this sampling program and, if necessary, removal of contaminated materials, the Company intends to enable NDEP and EPA to better define the CRMS and the currently designated risk areas so as to eventually exclude our land holdings from such areas and from the Site itself to the maximum extent feasible. NDEP and EPA are continuing to study the ecological and human health risks that may be presented by contaminated sediments in certain portions of the Carson River watershed and downstream areas. The agencies\u2019 studies indicate that these contaminants are primarily associated with historic mining tailings that have been redistributed into these waterways. The agencies have not adopted a remedial plan for these sediments nor have they decided whether remediation will be undertaken. Thus, there is no assurance that the Company will not be asked to undertake additional investigatory or remediation activities or to pay for such activities by the agencies, or that future changes in CRMS-related requirements will not negatively affect our operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings. Due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to a variety of regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. The results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation, including the effects of discovery of new evidence or advancement of new legal theories, the difficulty of predicting decisions of judges, and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal. There can be no assurances that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTitle claims against our properties could require us to compensate parties making such claims, if successful, and divert management\u2019s time from operations.\nThere may be challenges to our title in the properties in which we hold material interests. If there are title defects with respect to any of our properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property.\nThe validity of unpatented mineral claims, which constitute most of our holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested by the federal government and other parties. The validity of an unpatented mineral claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, depends on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state, statutory and decisional law. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our properties, we have not obtained title opinions or title insurance with respect to the acquisition of the unpatented mineral claims. The investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management\u2019s time from ongoing exploration programs.\nMine operators are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to their local communities.\nAs a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally, and corporations in natural resource industries, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, and communities surrounding operations benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies for which activities are perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments and communities.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect the Company and holders of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common shares is subject to volatility, has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to, among other things, changes in market sentiment regarding our operations, financial results or business prospects, the mining, metals, recycling or environmental remediation industries generally, coordinated trading activities, large derivative positions or the macroeconomic outlook. The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to our recent transactions. Certain events or changes in the market or our industries generally are beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors contained or incorporated by reference herein, factors that could impact our trading price include:\n-\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial results, including how those results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n-\nchanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other industry participants;\n-\nfailure to declare dividends on our common stock from time to time;\n-\nreports in the press or investment community relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n-\ndevelopments in our business or operations or our industry sectors generally;\n-\nany future offerings by us of our common stock;\n-\nany coordinated trading activities or large derivative positions in our common stock, for example, a short squeeze, which occurs when a number of investors take a short position in a stock and have to buy the borrowed securities to close out the position at a time that other short sellers of the same security also want to close out their positions, resulting in surges in stock prices when demand is greater than supply;\n-\nlegislative or regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations specifically;\n-\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n-\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors;\n-\nexpectations of (or actual) equity dilution, including the actual or expected dilution to various financial measures, including earnings per share, that may be caused by equity offerings;\n-\nactions by our current shareholders, including future sales of common shares by existing shareholders, including our directors and executive officers;\n-\nproposed or final regulatory changes or developments;\n-\nanticipated or pending regulatory investigations, proceedings, or litigation that may involve or affect us; and,\n-\nother changes in U.S. or global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity prices, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nOur stock has historically been a penny stock with trading restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nOur stock has historically been a penny stock. Rule 3a51-1 generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. When our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, additional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers that sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 (excluding one\u2019s primary residence), or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules (including Rule 15g-9) require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") sales practice requirements may also limit a stockbroker\u2019s ability to buy or sell our stock. In addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretation of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy or sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have relatively little research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock, or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may be delisted if we are unable to maintain the listing standards of the NYSE American stock exchange.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE American. To maintain our listing on the NYSE American, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuation as a result of periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations. If we fail to meet any of the NYSE American\u2019s listing standards, we may be delisted. In the event of delisting, trading of our common stock would most likely be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, which could have a material adverse effect on the market liquidity and value of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board, subject to compliance with applicable law, our organizational documents and any contractual provisions, including under agreements for indebtedness we may incur, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our board deems relevant. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future that could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 158,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 71,207,832 shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which no Preferred Shares are outstanding at the December 31, 2021. To maintain its capital at desired levels or to fund future growth, the board may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. In February 2021, the Company has also entered into an equity purchase agreement with Leviston Resources LLC relating to the offer and potential sale of up to $5,000,000 of common stock. The term of the agreement is 24 months. The sale of these securities may significantly dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interest and the market price of the common stock. New investors in other equity securities issued by the Company in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to, that may adversely impact, the Company\u2019s current stockholders. On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into equity purchase agreements with certain investors to issue and sell $4,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.00 per share for proceeds of approximately $15,000,000. The offering of the shares closed on March 4, 2021.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS\nWe have and may continue to pursue investments in other companies, acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or new properties, which could harm our operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.\nWe have made, and could make in the future, investments in other companies, including privately-held companies in a development stage, and most recently Quantum Generative Materials LLC, a company that plans to use quantum computer algorithms for development of new materials. Many of these equity investments in private companies are inherently risky because the companies\u2019 businesses may never develop, and we may incur losses related to these investments.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to various investments. In addition, we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other-than-temporary declines in their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Acquisitions of other companies or new properties, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies may create additional, material risks for our business that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results.\nSuch risk factors include the effects of possible disruption to the exploration activities and mine planning, loss of value associated with our properties, mismanagement of project development, additional risk and liability, indemnification obligations, sales of assets at unfavorable prices, failure to sell non-core assets at all, poor execution of the plans for such transactions, permit requirements, debt incurred or capital stock issued to enter into such transactions, the impact of any such transactions on our financial results, negative stakeholder reaction to any such transaction and our ability to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operations with our operations. If the purchase price of any acquired businesses exceeds the current fair values of the net tangible assets of such acquired businesses, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could result in significant impairment and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses and potential restructuring costs associated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results. Furthermore, potential transactions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management\u2019s attention and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition, to complete future\ntransactions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may undertake joint ventures, investments, joint projects and other strategic alliances and such undertakings, as well as our existing joint ventures, may be unsuccessful and may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have grown our business, in part, through strategic alliances and acquisitions, including through our shift to climate-smart mining and related development projects with partners that include Mercury Clean Up, LLC for the deployment of new metals extraction, LINICO Corporation for lithium-ion battery metal recycling and Renewable Process Solutions, Inc. for the extraction of lithium and the development and commercialization of next generation technologies to reduce the carbon footprint. We continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including product, technology, business or asset transactions. Such undertakings may not be successful or may take a substantially longer period than initially expected to become successful, and we may never recover our investments or achieve desired synergies or economies from these undertakings. This notwithstanding, we may in the future continue to seek to grow our operations in part by entering into joint ventures, or undertaking investments, joint projects or other strategic alliances with third parties in diversified precious and strategic metals production, renewable processing of natural resources, recycling and quantum computing. These activities involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration, and closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including permitting issues, or other conditions. Any current or future agreements that we may enter into also could expose us to new operational, regulatory, market, litigation and geographical risks as well as risks associated with significant capital requirements, the diversion of management and financial resources, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, sharing of proprietary information, loss of control over day-to-day operations, non-performance by a counterparty, potential competition and conflicts of interest. In addition, we may not be successful in finding suitable targets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Even if successfully negotiated and closed, expected synergies from a joint venture, investment or other strategic alliance may not materialize, may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business. We may also encounter difficulty integrating the operations, personnel and financial and operating systems of an acquired business into our current business. Given the specialized nature of our quantum computing strategic partners, we may not succeed in attracting and retaining specialized technical support including quantum computing programming and material science competencies or maintaining access to the specialized scientific resources and infrastructures we require to continue to integrate, develop and grow our business. Our growth may be limited by insufficient financial resources and competition in the developing industries in which we invest. We may need to raise additional debt funding or sell additional equity securities to enter into such joint ventures or make such acquisitions. However, we may not be able to obtain such debt funding or sell equity securities on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The raising of additional debt funding by us, if required and available, would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financing covenants, or liens on our assets, that would restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, if required and available, could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nFuture strategic partnerships and technical resources may be important to us. We will face significant competition in seeking new strategic partners or acquiring qualified, competent employees.\nWe have limited capabilities for new product development and manufacturing and do not yet have any capability for sales, marketing or distribution. For some of our program and product development candidates, we may not be able to attract or retain qualified computational material engineers, software engineers, photocatalysis experts, quantum chemists, quantum information scientists, quantum physicists, including but not limited to condensed matter physicists, mathematical physicists and computational physicists and/or third-party quantum computing companies for the development and potential commercialization of our products and solutions. The competition for strategic partners and quantum professionals is intense. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the strategic partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed strategic partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to customers, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The strategic partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Strategic partnerships are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. Even if we are successful in entering into collaboration, the terms and conditions of that collaboration may restrict us from entering into future agreements with other potential collaborators. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable strategic partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay one\nor more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into strategic partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our therapeutic platforms and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Any collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and we may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product candidate do not meet expectations or the partner terminates the collaboration. Any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, and increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches the market.\nIf we are unable to maintain existing or future strategic partnerships, or if these strategic partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nExisting and future strategic partnerships that we may enter into pose a number of risks, including the following:\n-\nwe may not be able to enter into critical strategic partnerships or enter them on favorable terms;\n-\nstrategic partners have significant discretion in determining the effort and resources that they will apply to such a partnership, and they may not perform their obligations as agreed or expected;\n-\nstrategic partners may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on changes in the partners\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n-\nstrategic partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the strategic partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than our product candidates;\n-\nproduct candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our strategic partners as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause strategic partners to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n-\na strategic partner with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product candidates;\n-\nkey personnel of strategic partners be unable or unwilling to continue in their respective positions with such strategic partners, and if such strategic partners are unable to find suitable replacements, our business and financial results could be materially negatively affected;\n-\ndisagreements with strategic partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, ownership of intellectual property, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n-\nstrategic partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n-\nstrategic partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n-\nstrategic partnerships may be terminated for the convenience of the partner and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and,\n-\nstrategic partners may not enable or maintain our access to quantum computing infrastructures at all, or on reasonably affordable terms.\nTonogold may be unsuccessful in profitably producing precious metals, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2021, Tonogold owes the Company $6,650,000 pursuant to its note receivable with the Company. Further, the Company\u2019s $910,558 in common stock investments in Tonogold at that date, could materially diminish if Tonogold is unsuccessful in profitably producing precious metals, or otherwise. Tonogold (and therefore the Company by extension) is susceptible to all of the same business risks that apply to the Company relating to financial, operational, lack of reserves/economic feasibility, regulatory and other matters set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Tonogold\u2019s failure to profitably produce precious metals could have a material adverse effect on any residual value of the Company in Comstock Mining LLC, including, but not limited to, future lease payments and royalty payments, indemnification of reclamation liabilities and assumed Northern Comstock LLC obligations, and payment of other obligations under Tonogold's agreement with the Company. In addition, Tonogold\u2019s management of the Lucerne may involve risks not otherwise present in wholly-owned projects, including the following:\n-\nTonogold has no operating history.\n-\nTonogold may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s interest.\n-\nWe do not have any control over the development, financing, management and other aspects of the Lucerne project, which prevents us from taking actions that are in our best interest but opposed by Tonogold.\n-\nWe may not maintain a good relationship with Tonogold and disputes between the Company and Tonogold may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the Lucerne project to additional risk.\n-\nTime delays associated with obtaining entitlements, unforeseen development issues, unanticipated labor and material cost increases, higher carrying costs, and general market deterioration and other changes may negatively impact the profitability and capital needs of Tonogold.\n-\nIt may be difficult or impossible for Tonogold to obtain requisite financing on commercially reasonable terms, if it is able to secure financing at all.\n-\nTonogold could become insolvent or bankrupt, which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nWe have invested capital in high-risk mineral and metals projects where we have not conducted sufficient exploration, development and engineering studies.\nWe have invested capital and have otherwise been involved in various mineral properties and renewable metals projects in the Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, where we have not conducted sufficient exploration, development and/or engineering studies to minimize the risk of project failure. Our mineral projects involve high risks because we have not invested sufficiently in the characterization of mineralized material, geologic analysis, metallurgical testing, mine planning and economic analysis. Standard industry practice calls for a mining company to prepare a formal mine plan and mining production schedule and have these documents reviewed and validated by a third-party specialist. We have not had a formal mine plan and mining production schedule economically validated by a third-party specialist.\nThe nature of our strategic joint ventures is speculative and dependent on a number of variables beyond our control that cannot be reliably ascertained in advance.\nThe revenues and profits of an enterprise involved in the creation of new industries and markets are generally dependent upon many variables. Our customer appeal depends upon factors which cannot be reliably ascertained in advance and over which we have no control, such as unpredictable customer needs and competitive products. As with any new business enterprise operating in a specialized and intensely competitive market, we are subject to many business risks which include, but are not limited to, unforeseen marketing difficulties, excessive research and development expenses, unsuccessful development projects, including those for new materials, an inability to successfully harness a general adversarial neural network (\u201cGANN\u201d) and apply the GANN effectively in simulating existing materials, generating new materials and/or commercialize them profitably, unforeseen negative publicity, competition, product liability issues, manufacturing and logistical difficulties, and lack of operating\nexperience. Many of the risks may be unforeseeable or beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we or our strategic joint venture partners will successfully implement our business plan in a timely or effective manner, that we will be able to generate sufficient interest in our products, or that we will be able to market and sell enough products and services to generate sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to commercialize and release products based on our quantum computing investment that are accepted in the market or that generate significant revenues, our financial results will continue to suffer.\nThere can be no assurances that consumer or commercial demand for our future products will meet, or even approach, our expectations. In addition, our pricing and marketing strategies may not be successful. Lack of customer demand, a change in marketing strategy and changes to our pricing models could dramatically alter our financial results. Unless we are able to release products and sell services that meet a significant market demand, we will not be able to improve our financial condition or the results of our future operations.\nOur success in development in the quantum computing industry depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nThe success of our strategic partnerships in the quantum computing industry and the subsequent use of quantum intellectual property in the mining, batteries and carbon capture and utilization fields of use will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, or offer for sale our future approved products or impair our competitive position. Our research, development and commercialization activities with regard to quantum intellectual property for mining, batteries, and carbon capture and utilization applications may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Patents that we may ultimately be found to infringe could be issued to third parties. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing quantum intellectual property for mining, batteries, and carbon capture applications. If our intellectual property usage was to be found to infringe any such patents, and we were unable to invalidate those patents, or if licenses for them are not available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Furthermore, even if a license is available, it may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Our failure to maintain a license to any technology that we require may also materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we would be exposed to a threat of litigation. Our success may be harmed by potential uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for quantum intellectual property for mining, batteries, and carbon capture applications and related technology, our business could be materially harmed. Additionally, our intellectual property rights or proprietary information may be jeopardized or invalidated if strategic partners do not properly maintain and defend such information. Conflicts with our strategic partners over proprietary rights, ownership of intellectual property, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of new developments, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive.\nOur strategic partnerships rely on the availability of third-party intellectual property, which may not be accessible to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nSome of our strategic partnerships and future development of products include or will include third-party intellectual property, which may require licenses for our use. We believe that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses for new or current products on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain or maintain such licenses may limit our ability to develop materials, meet the goals of our strategic partnerships, or grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results. The quantum computing industry is quickly developing, and as such, is and will remain dynamic and competitive for the foreseeable future. As this industry continues to grow and mature, there may be an influx of new products, technological advances, and new concepts that can dramatically transform the industry and our business. There is a broad variety of entities that are known to be engaged in research and development relating to quantum computing, which range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to smaller privately funded startups whose narrower product focuses may let them be more effective in deploying resources towards a specific industry demand. We believe competition in this market segment will intensify. Our success in the market segment will depend on our ability to deploy our quantum intellectual property effectively and profitably into mining, battery or carbon capture fields of use. Our\ncompetitors could use their financial, technical, product development and marketing resources to market or develop products or services that are more effective or less costly than any or all of our products or services. Our ability to evolve, and adapt rapidly over an extended period of time will be critical in remaining competitive.\nWe rely on third parties for certain cloud-based software platforms, which impact our financial, operational and research activities. If any of these third parties fail to provide timely, accurate and ongoing service or if the technology systems and infrastructure suffer outages that we are unable to mitigate, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe currently rely upon third parties to provide certain information technology, quantum computing systems and infrastructure, and other storage and connectivity on internal or \u201ccloud-based\u201d platforms. Any of these systems and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, vandalism, sabotage, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power outages, telecommunications failures, and computer viruses or other deliberate attempts to harm the systems. The occurrence of a natural or intentional disaster, any decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice, or particularly an unanticipated problem at a cloud-based virtual server facility, could result in harmful interruptions in our service, resulting in adverse effects to our business. The failure of any of these third parties to provide accurate and timely service may adversely impact our business operations. In addition, if such third-party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, increase their fees or if our relationships with these providers deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs until an equivalent provider could be found, if at all, or we could develop internal capabilities, if ever. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in choosing or finding high-quality partners, if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them, or if we ineffectively manage these relationships, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur business depends on a limited number of key personnel, the loss of whom could negatively affect us.\nOur officers and employees are important to our success. If any of them becomes unable or unwilling to continue in their respective positions, and we are unable to find suitable replacements, our business and financial results could be materially negatively affected. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including personnel with advanced manufacturing expertise, quantum physicists, chemists, and data and material engineers, necessary to develop our business and grow our strategic partnerships. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that we require and the competition for qualified personnel, we may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel we require to meet the goals of our strategic partnerships or our operations. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nThe Company may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, the fact that it may report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause the Company to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nDiversity in application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results.\nThe mining industry has limited industry-specific accounting literature and, as a result, we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining-specific issues. As diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed, we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur ability to execute our strategic plan depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur strategic plan is focused on high-value, cash-generating, precious metal-based activities, including, but not limited to, environmentally friendly and economically enhancing clean mining and processing technologies, precious-metal exploration, resource development, economic feasibility assessments and cash-generating mineral production. Many of the factors that impact our ability to execute our strategic plan, such as the advancement of certain technologies, legal and regulatory obstacles and general economic conditions, are beyond our control. Changes in value or a lack of demand for the sale of non-core assets would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. Our inability to identify successful joint venture candidates and to complete joint ventures or strategic alliances as planned or to realize expected synergies and strategic benefits could impact our financial condition and performance. Our inability to deploy capital to maximize shareholder value could impact our financial performance. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to execute any or all of our strategic plan. Failure to execute any or all of our strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness and payment obligations could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, cash flow, and operating flexibility.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and lease payment obligations, and the covenants contained in our debt agreements and documents governing such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The size and terms of certain of our agreements limits our ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, engineering and product development costs, and other general corporate requirements. Other consequences for our operations could include:\n-\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our other indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such other indebtedness;\n-\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n-\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and,\n-\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt.\nOur ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt will depend on our future performance and the other cash requirements of our business. Our performance is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control in addition to challenges that are unique to the Company. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and lease obligations.\nOur debt and lease agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: make restricted payments; incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock; create liens; engage in mergers or consolidations or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; make certain dispositions and transfers of assets; place limitations on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make distributions; enter into transactions with affiliates; and guarantee indebtedness. One or more of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to execute our preferred business strategy, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.\nUpon an event of default, if not waived by our financing parties, our financing parties may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other obligations. If our current financing parties accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness or obligations, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our financing parties on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt and lease obligations. Further, the financing parties would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.", "PERMNO": 12840, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "LODE"}
