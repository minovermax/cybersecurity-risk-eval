Risk Factors\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our Class A Common Stock. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are those that we have identified as material and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be other risks that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. Please refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitation on forward-looking statements set forth on page ii hereof.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial results.\nWe face risks related to public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although our operations have been deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing in addition to other actions taken by both businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. The collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with the current oil oversupply, has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on the demand for our services. The decline in our customers\u2019 demand for our services has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on our customers, operations, and employees. These effects have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects, financial health of our customers and therefore their ability to drill and complete wells or pay for services provided, financial health of our suppliers and therefore their ability to deliver necessary goods and services, disruptions to our operations, and ultimately the financial health and results of the Company. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it may last for an extended period of time.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results are affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate the other risk factors that we identify herein. COVID-19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers, suppliers or vendors could adversely impact our operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWeak economic conditions and widespread financial distress, including the significantly reduced global and national economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could reduce the liquidity of our customers, suppliers or vendors, making it more difficult for them to meet their obligations to us. We are therefore subject to heightened risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, suppliers and vendors. Severe financial problems encountered by our customers, suppliers and vendors could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us, or to enforce the performance of obligations owed to us under contractual arrangements. In the event that any of our customers was to enter into bankruptcy, we could lose all or a portion of the amounts owed to us by such customer, and we may be forced to cancel all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense to us.\nIn addition, nonperformance by suppliers or vendors who have committed to provide us with critical products or services could raise our costs or interfere with our ability to successfully conduct our business. All of the above may be exacerbated in the future as the COVID-19 outbreak and the governmental responses to the outbreak continue. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, may precipitate a continued economic slowdown and/or a recession.\nRisks Related to the OneStim Acquisition\nThe integration of the Transferred Business may not be as successful as anticipated, and the Company may not achieve the intended benefits or do so within the intended timeframe.\nThe OneStim Acquisition involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks. Difficulties in integrating the Transferred Business, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the Company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the delay or failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies, and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors:\n\u2022 the inability to successfully integrate the Transferred Business, operationally and culturally, in a manner that permits the Company to achieve the full revenue anticipated from the OneStim Acquisition;\n\u2022 performance shortfalls due to COVID-19 pandemic and related decline in demand for our services;\n\u2022 complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex, integrated business, including the potential diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022 not realizing anticipated operating synergies;\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the OneStim Acquisition;\n\u2022 integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022 performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the OneStim Acquisition and integrating the Transferred Business operations; and\n\u2022 the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAdditionally, the success of the OneStim Acquisition will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the Transferred Business and the Company\u2019s business, including operational and other synergies that the Company believes we will achieve. The anticipated benefits of the OneStim Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that the Company does not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that the Company has made, such as the achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized.\nThe Company\u2019s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the OneStim Acquisition.\nSince the OneStim Acquisition, the size of the Company\u2019s business has increased significantly. In addition, we now own and operate two sand mines. While we have retained qualified personnel to operate the mines, we have not undertaken mining operations in the past. The Company\u2019s future success will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to manage this expanded business, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the Transferred Business and their operations into the Company\u2019s existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners. Failure to successfully manage the Transferred Business may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Schlumberger Parties now have significant influence over us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Schlumberger owned approximately 37% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. As long as Schlumberger owns or controls a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to significantly influence corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of the board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), any amendment to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. Schlumberger\u2019s influence over our management could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of the shares of Class A Common Stock to decline or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for the shares of Class A Common Stock.\nPursuant to the A&R Stockholders Agreement, Schlumberger has designated two directors to the Company\u2019s board of directors. Schlumberger\u2019s right to designate directors to our Board is subject to the Schlumberger\u2019s ownership percentage of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock. If Schlumberger and its affiliates collectively beneficially own: (a) 20% or greater of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, they will have the right to appoint two directors or (b) at least 10% but less than 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, they will have the right to appoint one director.\nSchlumberger\u2019s interests may not align with the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of Class A Common Stock in the open market by Schlumberger could depress the Company\u2019s stock price.\nShares of Class A Common Stock that were issued to Schlumberger in the OneStim Acquisition will become freely tradable once registered pursuant to the amended and restated registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the OneStim Acquisition (\u201cA&R Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). As a result, the shares of Class A Common Stock held by Schlumberger will have no restrictions other than described below or require further registration under the Securities Act, provided, however, that any stockholders, including Schlumberger, who are deemed the Company\u2019s affiliates will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nPursuant to the A&R Stockholders Agreement, Schlumberger is subject to certain lock-up and transfer restrictions. Schlumberger will not, (a) for a period of nine months from December 31, 2020 (the \u201cClosing\u201d), transfer or dispose of (or take other analogous actions in accordance with the terms of the A&R Stockholders Agreement) any economic, voting or other rights in or to their shares of Class A Common Stock, other than certain permitted transfers, and (b) for a period of four years from the Closing, make any transfer of shares of Class A Common Stock to any direct competitor of the Company or to any person that is subject to, or by virtue of such transfer would become subject to, the reporting obligations under Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, with respect to shares of Common Stock.\nFollowing the lock-up and transfer restrictions period described above, Schlumberger may wish to dispose of some or all of its interests in the Company, and as a result may seek to sell its shares of Class A Common Stock. These sales (or the perception that these sales may occur), coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of shares of Class A Common Stock, may affect the market for, and the market price of, shares of Class A Common Stock in an adverse manner.\nIf Schlumberger sells substantial amounts of Class A Common Stock in the public market, the market price of the Class A Common Stock may decrease.\nFollowing the OneStim Acquisition, we expanded our operations to Canada and may be subject to increased business and economic risks.\nThe Company has historically owned and operated its assets exclusively within the United States. In connection with the OneStim Acquisition, we acquired certain Canadian assets and liabilities, which marked our entry into a new geographical territory where we have limited or no experience in owning and operating assets and providing our services. As a result, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; complying with multiple tax jurisdictions; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and compliance costs associated with international locations and employees; regulations that might add difficulties in repatriating cash earned outside the United States and otherwise preventing us from freely moving cash; complying with statutory equity requirements; and complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in Canada. If we fail to manage our operations in Canada successfully, our business may suffer.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews and investment practices for such activities may serve to limit future oil and natural gas E&P activities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nVarious federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives have been, or could be undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (the \u201cSDWA UIC\u201d) program and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies but increased scrutiny and regulation, by federal agencies does occur. For example, in late 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) released a final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing fluid and issued guidance of such activities. Furthermore, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (the \u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in 2015 that established stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands. The rule was since rescinded, but the rescission is currently on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Similarly, the EPA has adopted rules on the capture of methane and other emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. These rules have been the subject of ongoing legal challenges. Notwithstanding these legal challenges, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 that called for issuance of proposed rules by no later than September 2021 that would restore rules for methane standards applicable to new, modified, and reconstructed sources and establish new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission,\nprocessing and storage segments. In addition to federal regulatory actions, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.\nThe Biden Administration is expected to place significant emphasis on steps to address climate change. Although the U.S. had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, which requested that nations limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. With this recommitment, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement\u2019s goals, including additional restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or related oil and gas development activities. Additionally, in January 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order that effectively suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days, but the suspension does not limit existing operations under valid leases. President Biden followed with an executive order that ordered the Secretary of the Interior to pause the issuance of new oil and gas leases on federal public lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities. This order further directs agencies to identify fossil fuel subsidies provided by such agencies and take measures to ensure that federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels, with an objective of eliminating fossil fuel subsidies from federal budget requests beginning in 2022. This order is currently being challenged by industry groups. It remains to be seen to what extent the Biden Administration will pursue legislation, additional executive actions, regulations or other regulatory initiatives to limit, delay or prohibit hydraulic fracturing or other aspects of oil and gas development. In the event that these or other new federal restrictions, delays or prohibitions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we or our customers conduct business, we or our customers may incur additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant and, in the case of our customers, also could result in added restrictions or delays in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, which would in turn reduce the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMoreover, many states and local governments have adopted regulations that impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states where we or our customers operate, such as Texas, Colorado and North Dakota. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, as several states have already done. In addition, some states have adopted broader sets of requirements related to oil and gas development more generally that could impact hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in 2019 the Colorado legislature adopted SB 19-181, which gave greater regulatory authority to local jurisdictions. In response, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission modified its rules to address the requirements of the legislation, adopting increased setback requirements and provisions for assessing alternative sites for well pads to minimize environmental impacts. Environmental groups, local citizens groups and others continue to seek to use a variety of means to force action on additional restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and oil and gas development generally.\nA theme of avoiding or limiting investment in companies that engage in hydraulic fracturing has entered into capital markets. For example, in July 2020, Deutsche Bank announced that it would no longer finance oil and gas projects that use hydraulic fracturing in countries with scarce water supplies. Moreover, BlackRock recently affirmed its commitment to divest from investments in fossil fuels due to concerns over climate change. While a substantial number major banks and financing sources remain active in investments related to hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that the investment avoidance or limitation theme could expand in the future and restrict access to capital for companies like us.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays for our customers or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult for us and our customers to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or a furtherance of themes of investment avoidance or limitation in hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time. Such a decrease could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biofuels) or increased focus on reducing the use of combustion engines in transportation (such as governmental mandates that ban the sale of new gasoline-powered automobiles) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nOur business depends on domestic capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by our customers\u2019 capital spending to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of a decline in commodity prices. Reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. If current activity levels decrease or our customers further reduce their capital spending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022expected economic returns to E&P companies of new well completions;\n\u2022domestic and foreign economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing services and equipment in the United States;\n\u2022federal, tribal, state and local laws, regulations and taxes, including the policies of governments regarding hydraulic fracturing and oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities as well as non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022actions by the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with respect to oil production levels and potential changes in such levels;\n\u2022global weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemical additives in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources; and\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital and debt financing.\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our hydraulic fracturing services and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our hydraulic fracturing services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. This, in turn, could lead to lower demand for our services and may cause lower utilization of our assets. We have experienced, and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the year 2020, the posted West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) price traded at an average of $39.16 per barrel (\u201cBbl\u201d), well below the 2019 average of $56.99 per Bbl. As discussed elsewhere, the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the breakdown of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and non-OPEC suppliers (collectively, \u201cOPEC+\u201d) production cut negotiations in the spring caused oil prices to drop to historical lows in April 2020. Prices have started to recover, and averaged $53.93 per Bbl since the beginning of 2021 through February 16, 2021. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile, our operations, financial condition, cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by us for our operations or by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our operations and the operations of our oil and natural gas producing customers require permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities, secure water rights, or other regulated activities. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such regulated activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In addition, some of our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities may take place on federal land or Native American lands, requiring leases and other approvals from the federal government or Native American tribes to conduct such drilling and completion activities or other regulated activities. Under certain circumstances, federal agencies may cancel proposed leases for federal lands and refuse to grant or delay required approvals. Therefore, our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us and adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers.\nOil and natural gas companies\u2019 operations using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water for E&P activities and the disposal of flowback and produced water may impact their operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWater is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our oil and natural gas producing customers\u2019 access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, privatization, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. The occurrence of these or similar developments may result in limitations being placed on allocations of water due to needs by third party businesses with more senior contractual or permitting rights to the water. Our customers\u2019 inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact their E&P operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, the imposition of new environmental regulations and other regulatory initiatives could include increased restrictions on our producing customers\u2019 ability to dispose of flowback and produced water generated in hydraulic fracturing or other fluids resulting from E&P activities. Applicable laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and require that permits or other approvals be obtained to discharge pollutants to such waters. Additionally, regulations implemented under both federal and state laws prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. These laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and hazardous substances. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells and any inability to secure transportation and access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of our flowback and produced water on economic terms may increase our customers\u2019 operating costs and could result in restrictions, delays, or cancellations of our customers\u2019 operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas which would in turn reduce the demand for our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal, and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nOur operations are subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to significant hazards often found in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, including accidents related to trucking operations provided in connection with our services, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills and releases of hydraulic fracturing fluids or other well fluids into the environment. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022disruption in operations;\n\u2022substantial repair or remediation costs;\n\u2022personal injury or loss of human life;\n\u2022significant damage to or destruction of property, and equipment;\n\u2022environmental pollution, including groundwater contamination;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;\n\u2022impairment or suspension of operations; and\n\u2022substantial revenue loss.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used or trucking services provided in connection therewith may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. Litigation arising from operations where our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. We maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against these potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, and we are not fully insured against all risks.\nIn addition, our customers usually assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or contamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling and completion fluids. We may have liability in such cases if we are grossly negligent or commit willful acts. Our customers generally agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees\u2019 personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, their employees are injured by such operations, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our customers also generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment. In turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or\nequipment we own and for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. However, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual liability allocation or might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment including natural resources, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations and the operations of our customers, including the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that may be released into the environment or injected in non-productive formations below ground in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we are providing services, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations, and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Any failure on our part or the part of our customers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in assessment of sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, performance or development of projects or operations; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area.\nOur business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities, including costs and liabilities resulting from our handling of oilfield and other wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and due to historical oilfield industry operations and waste disposal practices. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations or at facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for injuries to persons or damages to properties or natural resources. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Remedial costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nLaws and regulations protecting the environment generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. In particular, the federal Endangered Special Act (\u201cESA\u201d) restricts activities that may result in a \u201ctake\u201d of endangered or threatened species and provides for substantial penalties in cases where listed species are taken by being harmed. The dunes sagebrush lizard is one example of a species that, if listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, could impact our operations and the operations of our customers. The dunes sagebrush lizard is found in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas, including areas where our customers operate and our frac sand facilities are located. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently conducting a thorough review to determine whether listing the dunes sagebrush lizard as endangered or threatened under the ESA is warranted. If the dunes sagebrush lizard is listed as an endangered or threatened species, our operations and the operations of our customers in any area that is designated as the dunes sagebrush lizard\u2019s habitat may be limited, delayed or, in some circumstances, prohibited, and we and our customers could be required to comply with expensive mitigation measures intended to protect the dunes sagebrush lizard and its habitat. Furthermore, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement with respect to environmental matters could restrict, delay or curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas by our customers and could limit our well servicing opportunities.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nTechnology advancements in well service technologies, including those involving hydraulic fracturing, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe hydraulic fracturing industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or services at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. New technology could also make it easier for our customers to vertically integrate their operations, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for our services. Limits on our ability to effectively use or implement new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Mines and Wireline Service\nThe sand mining operations are subject to a number of risks relating to the proppant industry.\nIn connection with the OneStim Acquisition, we acquired two state-of-the-art sand mines in the Permian Basin. Sand mining operations are subject to risks normally encountered in the proppant industry. These risks include, among others: unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions; inability to acquire or maintain, or public or nongovernmental organization opposition to, necessary permits for mining, access or water rights; our ability to timely obtain necessary authorizations, approvals and permits from regulatory agencies (including environmental agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, where our operations in West Texas may be slowed, limited or halted due to conservation efforts targeted at the habitat of the dunes sagebrush lizard); pit wall or pond failures, and sluffing events; costs associated with environmental compliance or as a result of unauthorized releases into the environment; restrictions imposed on our operations related to the protection of natural resources, including plant and animal species; and reduction in the amount of water available for processing. Any of these risks could result in delays, limitations or cancellations in mining or processing activities, losses or possible legal liability.\nSilica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Historically, our environmental compliance costs with respect to existing crystalline silica requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, federal regulatory authorities and analogous state agencies may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits, required controls and personal protective equipment. We may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.\nIn addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. The actual or perceived health risks of handling hydraulic fracture sand could materially and adversely affect hydraulic fracturing service providers, including us, through reduced use of hydraulic fracture sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the industry. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs with respect to purchasing specialized equipment designed to reduce exposure to crystalline silica in connection with our operations or invest capital in new equipment.\nWe are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of its operations.\nOur operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the re-interpretation or more stringent enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on its ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.\nThe occurrence of explosive incidents could disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe wireline service we provide to oil and natural gas E&P customers involves the storage and handling of explosive materials. Despite the use of specialized facilities to store explosive materials and intensive employee training programs, the handling of explosive materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or E&P customers\u2019 operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of services. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, E&P customers and third parties could also occur. Any explosive incident could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the TRAs\nThe Company is required to make payments under the TRAs for certain tax benefits that it may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d), on January 17, 2018, the Company entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements (the \u201cTRAs\u201d) with R/C Energy IV Direction Partnership, L.P. and the then-existing owners of Liberty Holdings that continued to own Liberty LLC Units (the \u201cLegacy Owners\u201d and each such person and any permitted transferee, a \u201cTRA Holder\u201d ). The TRAs generally provide for the payment by the Company to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) that the Company actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of certain increases in tax basis, net operating losses available to the Company as a result of the corporate reorganization performed in connection with the IPO (\u201cCorporate Reorganization\u201d), and certain benefits attributable to imputed interest. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nThe Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Liberty LLC. Because the Company has no independent means of generating revenue, its ability to make payments under the TRAs is dependent on the ability of Liberty LLC to make distributions to the Company in an amount sufficient to cover its obligations under the TRAs. To the extent that the Company is unable to make payments under the TRAs for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nThe term of each of the TRAs continues until all tax benefits that are subject to such TRAs have been utilized or expired, unless the Company experiences a change of control (as defined in the TRAs, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the TRAs are terminated early (at the Company\u2019s election or as a result of its breach), and the Company makes the termination payments specified in such TRAs. In addition, payments the Company makes under the TRAs will be increased by any interest earned from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return. Payments under the TRAs commenced in 2020 and so long as the TRAs are not terminated, are anticipated to continue for 15 years after the date of the last redemption of the Liberty LLC Units.\nIn certain cases, if the Company experiences a change of control (as defined under the TRAs, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the TRAs terminate early (at the Company\u2019s election or as a result of its breach),the Company would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. As a result, the Company\u2019s obligations under the TRAs could have a substantial negative impact on its liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRAs. Furthermore, as a result of this payment obligation, holders of our Class A Common Stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change in control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Since our payment obligations under the TRAs will not be conditioned upon the TRA Holders\u2019 having continued interest in the Company or liberty LLC, the TRA Holders\u2019 interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A Common Stock.\nPayments under the TRAs are based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA Holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the TRAs if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the TRAs are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any TRA Holder will be netted against payments that would otherwise be made to such TRA Holder, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances the Company could make payments that are greater than its actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity. Furthermore, the payments under the TRAs will not be conditioned upon a holder of rights under each of the TRAs having a continued ownership interest in the Company or Liberty LLC. For further details of the TRAs, see Note 11-Income Taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nGeneral Risks Related to our Business\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers.\nOur future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, during times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our services. In addition, in the course of our business we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the financial distress or bankruptcy of a customer, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenues to us.\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nOur top five customers represented approximately 48%, 35%, and 42%, of our consolidated and combined revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. It is possible that we will derive a significant portion of our revenue from a concentrated group of customers in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us, revenue would be impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Additionally, if we were to lose any material customer or our customers were to consolidated or merger with other operators, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. In early 2020, we experienced a denial of service cyberattack that targeted a portion of our non-financial data. We immediately shutdown critical systems, diagnosed the root cause of the attack and then methodically returned systems online. This cyberattack disrupted certain non-financial aspects of our internal system for a period of less than one day, while limited and non-critical portions of our systems were kept offline for up to one week in order to properly evaluate the breach. We determined that this cyberattack did not materially affect any of our operations. We engaged in extensive data evaluation for potential damage and concluded that minimal to no data loss had occurred as a result of this cyberattack. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches in the future that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur hydraulic fracturing fleets and other completion service-related equipment require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. For example, since January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2020, we have deployed over 30 hydraulic fracturing fleets to service customers at a total cost to deploy of approximately $1.3 billion. The costs of components and labor have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs for any fleets we may acquire in the future. Our fleets and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, upgrades or refurbishment. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our hydraulic fracturing fleets and the increase in cost of labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may increase our costs.\nWe rely on certain third parties for proppant and chemical additives, and delays in deliveries of such materials, increases in the cost of such materials or our contractual obligations to pay for materials that we ultimately do not require could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with certain suppliers of our raw materials (such as proppant and chemical additives). Delays or shortages in raw materials can result from a variety of reasons, including those caused by weather and natural disasters. Even once the root cause of a shortage or delay has passed, it can take time for our supply chain to recover and run in a regular fashion. Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary materials or otherwise fail to deliver the materials in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increasing costs of such materials may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations requiring work stoppages, which are believed to have adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of materials, including proppant. Furthermore, to the extent our contracts require us to purchase more materials, including proppant, than we ultimately require, we may be forced to pay for the excess amount under \u201ctake or pay\u201d contract provisions.\nWe currently utilize one preferred assembler and a limited number of suppliers for major equipment to both build new fleets and upgrade any fleets we acquire to our preferred specifications, and our reliance on these vendors exposes us to risks including price and timing of delivery.\nWe currently utilize one preferred assembler and a limited number of suppliers for major equipment to both build our new fleets and upgrade any fleets we may acquire to our custom design. If demand for hydraulic fracturing fleets or the components necessary to build such fleets increases or these vendors face financial distress or bankruptcy, these vendors may not be able to provide the new or upgraded fleets on schedule or at the current price. If this were to occur, we could be required to seek another assembler or other suppliers for major equipment to build or upgrade our fleets, which may adversely affect our revenues or increase our costs.\nInterruptions of service on the rail lines by which we receive proppant could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe receive a portion of the proppant used in our hydraulic fracturing services by rail. Rail operations are subject to various risks that may result in a delay or lack of service, including lack of available capacity, mechanical problems, extreme weather conditions, work stoppages, labor strikes, terrorist attacks and operating hazards. Additionally, if we increase the amount of proppant we require for delivery of our services, we may face difficulty in securing rail transportation for such additional amount of proppant. Any delay or failure in the rail services on which we rely could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations including as a motor carrier by the DOT and by various federal, state and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our equipment transportation operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may\ndrive or work in any specific period and requiring onboard electronic logging devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and greenhouse gasses emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide trucking services, including hauling proppant to our customer work sites, and these third parties may fail to comply with various transportation regulations, resulting in our inability to use such third party providers. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nOur current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of February 19, 2021, we had $108.2 million outstanding under our Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under our ABL Facility (defined herein) with a borrowing base of $130.7 million, except for a letter of credit in the amount of $0.8 million. Please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Debt Agreements.\u201d\nMoreover, subject to the limits contained in our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d), we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time. Any borrowings we may incur in the future would have several important consequences for our future operations, including that:\n\u2022covenants contained in the documents governing such indebtedness may require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022we may be competitively disadvantaged to our competitors that are less leveraged or have greater access to capital resources; and\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we incur indebtedness in the future, we may have significant principal payments due at specified future dates under the documents governing such indebtedness. Our ability to meet such principal obligations will be dependent upon future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay any incurred indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenues.\nOur ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits, which legal requirements are subject to change. Existing and potential customers consider the safety record of their third-party service providers to be of high importance in their decision to engage such providers. If one or more accidents were to occur at one of our operating sites, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel its use of our equipment or services and may be less likely to continue to use our services, which could cause us to lose substantial revenues. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they elect not to engage us because they view our safety record as unacceptable. In addition, it is possible that we will experience multiple or particularly severe accidents in the future, causing our safety record to deteriorate. This may be more likely as we continue to grow, if we experience high employee turnover or labor shortage, or hire inexperienced personnel to bolster our staffing needs.\nIf we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nWe do not have patents or patent applications relating to many of our key processes and technology. If we are not able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or if our competitors are able to replicate our technology or services, our competitive advantage would be diminished. We also cannot ensure that any patents we may obtain in the future would provide us with any significant commercial benefit or would allow us to prevent our competitors from employing comparable technologies or processes.\nWe may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThird parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such legal proceedings related to such claims, and our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly regardless of the merits of any claim and is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, regardless of its outcome.\nIf we were to discover that our technologies or products infringe valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. If our inability to obtain required licenses for our technologies or products prevents us from selling our products, that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we currently license certain third party intellectual property in connection with our business, and the loss of any such license could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal weather conditions, natural disasters, public health crises, and other catastrophic events outside of our control could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\nOur operations are located in different regions of the United States. Some of these areas, including the DJ Basin, Powder River Basin, Williston Basin and our Canadian operations, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. However, as evidenced by the severe winter weather experienced in the southern United States and Canada during February 2021, weather-related hazards can exist in almost all the areas where we operate. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations or obtain adequate supplies of raw material or fuel, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Additionally, extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. As a result, a natural disaster or inclement weather conditions could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the area in which we operate or the market demand for oil and natural gas is affected by a public health crises, such as the coronavirus, or other similar catastrophic event outside of our control, our business and results of operations could suffer.", "PERMNO": 17221, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "LBRT"}
