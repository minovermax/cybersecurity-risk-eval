{"cik": "791908", "company": "XOMA Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Royalty Aggregator Strategy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact in the future our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which could cause delays or elimination of our receipts of potential milestones and royalties under our licensing or royalty and milestone acquisition arrangements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected global economic activity and resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact in the future our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which has and could further cause delays, suspensions or cancellations of their drug development efforts including, without limitation, their clinical trials, which would correspondingly delay, suspend or negate the timing of our potential receipts of milestones and royalties under our out-licensing or royalty acquisition agreements. The disruptions to our licensees or RPA counterparties or their licensees could include, without limitation:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in recruiting and enrolling new patients in their clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as their clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of their clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state or local governments, employers and others;\n\u25cf limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of their clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u25cf interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial supplies and materials, such as the investigational drug product used in their clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from the FDA, the EMA and other U.S. and foreign federal, state and local regulatory authorities to initiate their planned clinical trials or to market their products;\n\u25cf changes in FDA, state and local regulation (and those of their foreign counterparts if applicable) as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may change the ways in which clinical trials are conducted or discontinue clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u25cf delay in the timing of other interactions with the FDA due to absenteeism by federal employees or by the diversion of their efforts and attention to approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19; and\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States or of foreign regulatory authorities to accept data from clinical trials in affected areas outside their applicable countries.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and prospects and the overall economies of the United States and other countries will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, mutations in the COVID-19 virus, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose risks to our business, including at our headquarters in Emeryville, California, which has in the past been subject to local and statewide \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders issued by Alameda County and the Governor of the State of California, as well as the business or operations of our partners and other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in extended travel and other continued restrictions in order to reduce the spread of the disease, including California executive orders, San Francisco Bay Area orders and several other state and local orders across the United States, which, among other things, direct individuals to continue to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, and order cessation of non-essential travel. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business related activities have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, and manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended.\nIn response to these public health directives and orders, we previously implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees. We have been able to maintain our operations and productivity thus far; however, prolonged working remotely may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nIn addition, quarantines, stay-at-home, executive and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations continue to impact personnel at third-party clinical testing sites, manufacturing facilities, and the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our licensees\u2019 and RPA counterparties and their licensees\u2019 supply chains.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the evolving economic impacts brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have already resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets. While several of our partners have experienced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could continue to have an impact on our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in future periods.\nOur acquisitions of potential future royalty and/or milestone payments may not produce anticipated revenues and/or may be negatively affected by a default or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) under the applicable license agreement(s) covering such potential royalties and/or milestones, and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able to recuperate our capital expenditures associated with the acquisition.\nWe are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire future royalties, milestones and other payments related to drug development and sales as part of our royalty aggregator strategy or to acquire companies that hold royalty assets. Generally, at any time, we seek to have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions. Many potential acquisition targets do not meet our criteria, and for those that do, we may face significant competition for these acquisitions from other royalty buyers and enterprises. Competition for future asset acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for such assets and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. The success of our acquisitions is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, probability, timing and amount of potential future royalty and milestone payments as well as the viability of the underlying technology and intellectual property. The failure of any of these acquisitions to produce anticipated revenues may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of these acquisitions may expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) that are parties to the applicable license agreement(s) covering the potential milestone and royalty streams being acquired. In addition, recent volatility in on the capital markets may limit our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 ability to access additional funding. While we generally try to structure our receipt of potential milestone and royalty payments to minimize the risk associated with such a default or bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that any such default or bankruptcy will not adversely affect our ability to receive future potential royalty and/or milestone payments. To mitigate this risk, on occasion, we may obtain a security interest as collateral in such royalty, milestone and other payments. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the agreements covering the particular assets. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recuperate our full capital outlay. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our potential royalty acquisitions may be associated with drug products that are in clinical development and have not yet been commercialized. To the extent that such products are not successfully developed and commercialized, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Acquisitions of potential royalties associated with development stage biopharmaceutical product candidates are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nAs part of our royalty aggregator strategy, we may continue to purchase future potential milestone and royalty streams associated with drug products which are in clinical development and have not yet received marketing approval by any regulatory authority or been commercialized. There can be no assurance that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities will approve such products or that such products will be brought to market timely or at all, or that the market will be receptive to such products. To the extent that any such drug products are not successfully developed and subsequently commercialized, the value of our acquired potential milestone and royalty streams will be negatively affected. The ultimate success of our royalty aggregator strategy will depend on our ability to properly identify and acquire high quality products and the ability of the applicable counterparty to innovate, develop and commercialize their products, in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. Their inability to do so would negatively affect our ability to receive royalty and/or milestone payments. In addition, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit, such as protection of a patent estate, adequate reporting and other protections, and their failure to do so would presumably negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authority approves a development-stage product candidate that generates our royalty, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nIn addition, the developers of these development-stage product candidates may not be able to raise additional capital to continue their discovery, development and commercialization activities, which may cause them to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of their clinical trials or research and development programs. If other product developers introduce and market products that are more effective, safer, less invasive or less expensive than the relevant products that generate our royalties, or if such developers introduce their products prior to the competing products underlying our royalties, such products may not achieve commercial success and thereby result in a loss for us.\nFurther, the developers of such products may not have sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If no sales, marketing or distribution arrangements can be made on acceptable terms or at all, the affected product may not be able to be successfully commercialized, which will result in a loss for us. Losses from such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to continue, and may increase, this strategy of acquiring development-stage product candidates. While we believe that we can readily evaluate and gain conviction about the likelihood of a development-stage product candidate\u2019s approval and achieving significant sales, there can be no assurance that our assumptions will prove correct, that regulatory authorities will approve such development-stage product candidates, that such development-stage product candidates will be brought to market timely or at all, or that such products will achieve commercial success.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nBiopharmaceutical products are subject to sales risks.\nBiopharmaceutical product sales may be lower than expected due to a number of reasons, including pricing pressures, insufficient demand, product competition, failure of clinical trials, lack of market acceptance, obsolescence, loss of patent protection, government regulations, the impact of COVID-19 or other factors, and development-stage product candidates may fail to reach the market. Unexpected side effects, safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to a product, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, declining sales or litigation. As a result, payments of our future potential milestones and/or royalties may be reduced or cease. In addition, these potential payments may be delayed, causing our near-term financial performance to be weaker than expected.\nBiopharmaceutical products are subject to substantial competition.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The length of any product\u2019s commercial life cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that one or more products on which we are entitled to a potential milestone or royalty will not be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products or improvements on which we are not entitled to a potential milestone or royalty, either by the current marketer of such products or by another marketer. Current marketers of products may undertake these development efforts in order to improve their products or to avoid paying our royalty. Adverse competition, obsolescence or governmental and regulatory action or healthcare policy changes could significantly affect the revenues, including royalty-related revenues, of the products which generate our potential milestones and royalties.\nCompetitive factors affecting the market position and success of each product include:\n\u25cf effectiveness;\n\u25cf safety and side effect profile;\n\u25cf price, including third-party insurance reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf timing and introduction of the product;\n\u25cf effectiveness of marketing strategy and execution;\n\u25cf governmental regulation;\n\u25cf availability of lower-cost generics and/or biosimilars;\n\u25cf treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for a product; and\n\u25cf product liability claims.\nBiopharmaceutical products that have the potential to generate future milestones and royalties for us may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products, including generics and/or biosimilars, improvements on existing products or governmental or regulatory action. In addition, as biopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies using gene editing and new curative modalities, such as cell and gene therapy, products on which we have a milestone or royalty rights may become obsolete. These developments could have a material adverse effect on the sales of the biopharmaceutical products that have potential to generate our milestones and royalties, and consequently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty and milestone payments. While we typically have primary or back-up rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies, if available, to resolve any disputes resulting from any such audit.\nThe royalty, milestone and other payments we may receive are dependent on our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees\u2019 achievement of regulatory and developmental milestones and product sales. Each licensee\u2019s calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee and/or a licensee may fail to report the achievement of royalties or milestones in whole or in part. Our license and royalty agreements typically provide us the primary or back-up right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust\nour royalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on our part. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.\nAlthough we intend to regularly exercise our royalty audit rights as necessary and to the extent available, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report the achievement of milestones and royalty sales and calculate and pay applicable milestones and royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty and other audit rights, we rely on licensees\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to incur expenses to exercise legal remedies, if available, to enforce our agreements.\nThe lack of liquidity of our acquisitions of future potential milestones and royalties may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price, if at all. As a result, we may suffer losses.\nWe generally acquire milestone and royalty rights that have limited secondary resale markets and may be subject to transfer restrictions. The illiquidity of most of our milestone and royalty receivable assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price if at all and, as a result, we may suffer losses if we are required to dispose of any or all such assets in a forced liquidation or otherwise. In addition, if we liquidate all or a portion of our potential future milestone and/or purchased royalty stream interests quickly or relating to a forced liquidation, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these interests.\nOur royalty aggregator strategy may require that we register with the SEC as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nThe rules and interpretations of the SEC and the courts, relating to the definition of \"investment company\" are very complex. While we currently intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be an investment company under applicable SEC interpretations, we can provide no assurance that the SEC would not take the position that the Company would be required to register under the \u201840 Act and comply with the \u201840 Act\u2019s registration and reporting requirements, capital structure requirements, affiliate transaction restrictions, conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors, and other substantive provisions. We monitor our assets and income for compliance under the \u201840 Act and seek to conduct our business activities to ensure that we do not fall within its definitions of \u201cinvestment company\u201d or that we qualify under one of the exemptions or exclusions provided by the \u201840 Act and corresponding SEC regulations. If we were to become an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and be subject to the restrictions of the \u201840 Act, those restrictions likely would require significant changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative costs and burdens to our operations. To ensure we do not fall within the \u201840 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring the Company and/or modifying our mixture of assets and income or a liquidation of certain of our assets.\nOur licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees could be subject to natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events that could hinder or disrupt development efforts.\nWe depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates for which we may receive milestone, royalty and other payments in the future. Our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees operate research and development efforts in various locations in the United States and internationally. If any of their facilities is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, labor disputes or strikes, other conflict, or other events outside of their control, their research and development efforts could be disrupted, which could result in the delay or discontinuation of development of one or more of the product candidates in which we have rights to future milestone and/or royalty payments which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause many of the companies with which we do business also are in the biotechnology sector, the volatility of that sector can affect us indirectly as well as directly.\nThe same factors that affect us directly also can adversely affect us indirectly by affecting the ability of our partners and others with whom we do business to meet their obligations to us and reduce our ability to realize the value of the consideration provided to us by these other companies in connection with their licensing of our products.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results and Capital Requirements\nWe have sustained losses in the past, and we expect to sustain losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Although we generated net income of $15.8 million and $13.3 million and positive cash flows from operations of $22.7 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. We do not know whether we will ever achieve sustained profitability or whether cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt and royalty interests, and payments received under our collaboration and licensing arrangements. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our and our partners\u2019 ability to generate revenues. If our partners\u2019 product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following regulatory approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent in large part on the success of our and our partners\u2019 ability to license product candidates, and the success of our partners\u2019 development programs, both of which are uncertain. Our success is also dependent on our partners obtaining regulatory approval to market product candidates which may not materialize or prove to be successful.\nOur royalty aggregator strategy may require us to raise additional funds to acquire milestone and royalty interests; we cannot be certain that funds will be available or available at an acceptable cost of capital, and if they are not available, we may be unsuccessful in acquiring milestone and royalty interests to sustain the business in the future.\nWe may need to commit substantial funds to continue our business, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms, if at all. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us and/or result in dilution to our stockholders, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock At The Market Issuance Sales Agreement, as amended (the \u201c2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement\u201d) and to our 2021 Series B Preferred Stock At The Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \u201c2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement\u201d). Our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, while not dilutive, includes dividends and required that we establish a segregated cash account adequate to fund the dividends. If we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or enter into a license arrangement for a product candidate at an earlier stage of development or for a lesser amount than we might otherwise choose.\nIf adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may:\n\u25cf reduce or eliminate royalty aggregation efforts;\n\u25cf further reduce our capital or operating expenditures;\n\u25cf curtail our spending on protecting our intellectual property; or\n\u25cf take other actions which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the potential royalty acquisition market, including its structure and participants, or a reduction in the growth of the biopharmaceutical industry, could lead to diminished opportunities for us to acquire potential milestones\nand royalties, fewer potential milestones and royalties (or potential milestones or royalties of significant scale) being available, or increased competition for potential royalties. Even if we continue to acquire potential royalties and they become actual royalties, they may not generate a meaningful return for a period of several years, if at all, due to the price we pay for such royalties or other factors relating to the underlying products. As a result, we may not be able to continue to acquire potential milestones and royalties as we have in the past, or at all.\nWe have a continuing obligation to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which will be an on-going expenditure for us and may limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to $2.15625 per year). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October beginning April 15, 2021. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared), before any distribution or payment may be made to holders of shares of common stock or any other class or series of our equity stock ranking, as to liquidation rights, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices ranging from $26.00 per share to $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, depending on the date of redemption.\nHolders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375% of the $25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to $2,093.75 per year per share or $2.09375 per year per depositary share). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends are payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October beginning July 15, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we held restricted cash of $2.0 million in a segregated account that may only be used to pay dividends on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nThe payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is determined after considering current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities can reduce net earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity. A deficit in stockholders\u2019 equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Delaware law. On the other hand, our continued obligation to pay dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in Series B Preferred Stock could restrict us from additional borrowings or make them more costly.\nThe holders of preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had issued and outstanding 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share), plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Our preferred stock is senior to our shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our common stockholders.\nInformation available to us about the biopharmaceutical products underlying the potential royalties we buy may be limited and therefore our ability to analyze each product and its potential future cash flow may be similarly limited.\nWe may have limited information concerning the products generating the future potential milestones and royalties we are evaluating for acquisition. Often following our acquisition, the information we have regarding products underlying a potential milestone or royalty may be limited to the information that is available in the public domain. Therefore, there may be material information that relates to such products that we would like to know but do not have and may not be able to obtain. For example, we do not always know the results of studies conducted by sponsors of the products of others or the nature or number of any complaints from doctors or users of such products. In addition, the market data that we obtain independently may also prove to be incomplete or incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the actual potential cash flow from a potential royalty may be significantly lower than our estimates.\nOur future income is dependent upon numerous potential milestone and royalty-specific assumptions and, if these assumptions prove not to be accurate, we may not achieve our expected rates of returns.\nOur business model is based on multiple-year internal and external forecasts regarding potential product sales and numerous product-specific assumptions in connection with each potential milestone and royalty acquisition, including where we have limited information regarding the product. There can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying our financial models, including those regarding potential product sales or competition, patent expirations or license terminations for the products underlying our portfolio, are accurate. These assumptions involve a significant element of subjective judgment and may be and in the past have been adversely affected by post-acquisition changes in market conditions and other factors affecting the underlying product. Our assumptions regarding the financial stability or operational or marketing capabilities of the partner obligated to pay us potential royalties may also prove to be incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the assets in our current portfolio or future assets may not generate our projected returns or in the time periods we expect. This could negatively impact our results of operation for a given period.\nReductions or declines in income from potential milestones and royalties, or significant reductions in potential milestone or royalty payments compared to expectations, or impairments in the value of potential milestones and royalties acquired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount and duration of a royalty usually varies on a country-by-country basis and can be based on a number of factors, such as payments to third party licensors, whether the product is sold singly or in combination, patent expiration dates, regulatory exclusivity, years from first commercial sale of the applicable drug product, the entry of competing generic or biosimilar products, or other terms set out in the contracts governing the royalty. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen positive or negative developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, claims of patent misuse, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing for the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations. If an unexpected reduction in a royalty amount or shortening of a potential royalty term were to occur, it could result in a reduction in potential income from milestones and royalties, a significant reduction in potential milestones and royalty payments compared to expectations, or a permanent impairment of such potential milestones and royalty payments.\nA large percentage of the calculated net present value of our portfolio is represented by a limited number of products. The failure of any one of these products to move forward in clinical development or commercialization may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur asset portfolio may not be fully diversified by product, therapeutic area, geographic region or other criteria. Any significant deterioration in the amount or likelihood of receipt of potential cash flows from the top products in our asset portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in the prevention of organ rejection in patients receiving a kidney transplant after an interim analysis of data. In addition, should\nthe payor of any future potential milestones or royalties decline to pay such potential milestones and royalties for any reason, such failure may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe and our partners rely heavily on license and collaboration relationships, and any disputes or litigation with our partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us, including our ability to receive milestone payments and future potential royalty and other revenues. License or collaboration agreements relating to products may, in some instances, be unilaterally terminated or disputes may arise which may affect our potential milestones, royalties and other payments.\nLicense or collaboration agreements relating to the products generating our future potential milestones and royalties and other payment rights may be terminated, which may adversely affect sales of such products and therefore the potential payments we may receive. For example, under certain license or collaboration agreements, marketers may retain the right to unilaterally terminate the agreements. When the last patent covering a product expires or is otherwise invalidated in a country, a marketer may be economically motivated to terminate the applicable license or collaboration agreement, either in whole or with respect to such country, in order to terminate its payment and other obligations. In the event of such a termination, a licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator may no longer receive all of the payments it expected to receive from the applicable licensee or collaborator and may also be unable to find another company to continue developing and commercializing the product on the same or similar terms as those under the license or collaboration agreement that has been terminated.\nIn addition, license or collaboration agreements may fail to provide significant protection for the applicable licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator in case of the applicable licensee\u2019s or collaborator\u2019s failure to perform or in the event of disputes. License and collaboration agreements which relate to the products underlying our potential future milestones, royalties and other payment rights, are complex and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property, royalty terms, payment rights or other contractual terms subject to a license or collaboration agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope or duration of rights granted under the license or collaboration agreement and other interpretative issues;\n\u25cf the amounts or timing of royalties, milestones or other payments due under the license or collaboration agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent or other rights under our license or collaboration relationships;\n\u25cf the diligence obligations under the license or collaboration agreement and what activities satisfy such diligence obligations:\n\u25cf the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us or our partners; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nThe resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what the licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator believes to be the scope of its rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or decrease the licensee\u2019s or collaborator\u2019s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, any of which could in turn impact the value of our potential royalties, milestones and other payments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a marketer were to default on its obligations under a license or collaboration agreement, the licensor\u2019s or collaborator\u2019s remedy may be limited either to terminating certain licenses or collaborations related to certain countries or to generally terminate the license or collaboration agreement with respect to such country. In such cases, we may not have the right to seek to enforce\nthe rights of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) and we may be required to rely on the resources and willingness of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) to enforce its rights against the applicable licensee or collaborator. In any of these situations, if the expected upfront, milestone, royalty or other payments under the license or collaboration agreements do not materialize, this could result in a significant loss to us and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions with its licensees or collaborators regarding the interpretation of the payment and other provisions relating to products as to which we have milestones and potential royalty or other payment rights. Should any such discussions result in a disagreement regarding a particular product that cannot be resolved satisfactorily to us, we may end up being paid less than anticipated on such product should it successfully progress through clinical development and be approved for commercialization. Should our milestone and future potential royalty or other payment interests be reduced or eliminated as result of any such disagreement, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nOur existing collaborations may not continue or be successful, and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our unpartnered assets. Generally, our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations at will or under specified circumstances. If any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully (for example, by not making required payments when due, or at all or failing to engage in commercially reasonable efforts to develop products if required), our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated.\nOur potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third parties to provide services in connection with their product candidate development and manufacturing programs. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidate development.\nThird parties provide services in connection with preclinical and clinical development programs, including in vitro and in vivo studies, assay and reagent development, immunohistochemistry, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trial support, manufacturing and other outsourced activities. If these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which our potential milestone and royalty providers have contracted, or cease to continue operations, and are not able to find a replacement provider quickly or lose information or items associated with their drug product candidates, our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 development programs and receipt of any potential resulting income may be delayed.\nAgreements with other third parties, many of which are material to our business, expose us to numerous risks and have caused us to incur additional liabilities.\nBecause our licensees, suppliers and contractors are independent third parties, they may be subject to different risks than we are and have significant discretion in, and different criteria for, determining the efforts and resources they will apply related to their agreements with us. If these licensees, suppliers and contractors do not successfully perform the functions for which they are responsible, we may not have the capabilities, resources or rights to do so on our own.\nWe do not know whether we or our licensees will successfully develop and market any of the products that are or may become the subject of any of our licensing arrangements. In addition, third-party arrangements such as ours also increase uncertainties in the related decision-making processes and resulting progress under the arrangements, as we and our licensees may reach different conclusions, or support different paths forward, based on the same information, particularly when large amounts of technical data are involved.\nIn addition, under the contracts with HCRP, the amortization for the reporting period is calculated based on the payments expected to be made by the licensees to HCRP over the term of the arrangement. Any changes to the estimated payments by the licensees to HCRP can result in a material adjustment to revenue previously reported.\nFailure of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices standards may subject our licensees to delays in regulatory approval and penalties for noncompliance.\nOur potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third party manufacturers and such contract manufacturers are required to produce clinical product candidates under cGMP to meet acceptable standards for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale, as applicable. If such standards change, the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 drug product candidates on the schedule required for clinical trials or to meet commercial requirements may be affected. In addition, contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with our potential milestone and royalty providers or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce clinical and commercial supplies of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates.\nContract manufacturers are subject to pre-approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. Any difficulties or delays in contractors\u2019 manufacturing and supply of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates or any failure of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 contractors to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase costs, reduce revenue, make our licensees postpone or cancel clinical trials, prevent or delay regulatory approval by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities, prevent the import and/or export of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates, or cause any of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 products that may be approved for commercial sale to be recalled or withdrawn.\nCertain of our technologies are in-licensed from third parties, so our and our licensees\u2019 capabilities use of them may be restricted and subject to additional risks.\nWe have licensed technologies from third parties. These technologies include phage display technologies licensed to us in connection with our bacterial cell expression technology licensing program and antibody products. However, our and our licensees and collaborators\u2019 use of these technologies is limited by certain contractual provisions in the licenses relating to them, and although we have obtained numerous licenses, intellectual property rights in the area of phage display are particularly complex. If we are unable to maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property, we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and for future prospects. Our licensors also may seek to terminate our license, which could cause us and our licensees to lose the right to use the licensed intellectual property and adversely affect our and our licensees\u2019 ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services.\nRisks Related to Our Milestone Royalty Streams\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire potential milestone and royalty streams on other products, product candidates, or programs, or other companies to grow and diversify our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any such products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nTo grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify and seek to acquire and/or in-license potential milestone and royalty streams or companies. Future growth through acquisition or in-licensing will depend upon the availability of suitable products, product candidates, programs or companies for acquisition or in-licensing on acceptable prices, terms and conditions. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to acquire rights to them on acceptable terms, or at all. The competition to acquire or in-license rights to promising products, product candidates, programs and companies is fierce, and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources, personnel, and experience than we have. In order to compete successfully in the current business climate, we may have to pay higher prices for assets than may have been paid historically, which may make it more difficult for us to realize an adequate return on any acquisition.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license new products, product candidates, programs or companies, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions through, among other things, due diligence, indemnification and risk allocation, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business. In any event, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or in-licensing for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that a product candidate fails to advance to clinical development, proves not to be safe or effective in clinical trials, or that a product fails to reach its forecasted commercial potential or that the integration of a product, product candidate, program or company gives rise to unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our potential royalty providers\u2019 therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our potential royalty providers will be unable to market them.\nOur potential royalty providers\u2019 product candidates cannot be manufactured and marketed in the United States or any other countries without required regulatory approvals. The U.S. government and governments of other countries extensively regulate many aspects of our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf clinical development and testing;\n\u25cf manufacturing;\n\u25cf labeling;\n\u25cf storage;\n\u25cf record keeping;\n\u25cf promotion and marketing; and\n\u25cf importing and exporting.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act.\nInitiation of clinical trials requires approval by health authorities. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices and the European Clinical Trials Directive, as applicable, under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Other national, foreign and local regulations also may apply. The developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization and controls of the product before administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials. This requires developing approved assays of the product to test before administration to the patient and during the conduct of the trial. In addition, developers of pharmaceutical products must provide periodic data regarding clinical trials to the FDA and other health authorities, and these health authorities may issue a clinical hold upon a trial if they do not believe, or cannot confirm, that the trial can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the trial participants.\nThe results of the preclinical studies and clinical testing, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA and other health authorities in the form of a NDA for a drug, and in the form of a BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA or foreign health authorities may grant marketing approvals, request additional information or further research, or\ndeny the application if they determine the application does not satisfy regulatory approval criteria. Regulatory approval of an NDA, BLA, or supplement is never guaranteed. The approval process can take several years, is extremely expensive and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Our potential royalty providers ultimately may not be able to obtain approval in a timely fashion or at all.\nThe FDA and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion in the drug and biologics approval processes. Despite the time and expense incurred, failure can occur at any stage, and our potential development partners could encounter problems that cause abandonment of clinical trials or cause them to repeat or perform additional preclinical, clinical or manufacturing-related studies.\nChanges in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in, or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in both the product approval process and manufacturing facility approval process, and as a result of this discretion and uncertainties about outcomes of testing, we cannot predict at what point, or whether, the FDA or other regulatory agencies will be satisfied with our licensees\u2019 submissions or whether the FDA or other regulatory agencies will raise questions that may be material and delay or preclude product approval or manufacturing facility approval. In light of this discretion and the complexities of the scientific, medical and regulatory environment, our or our potential royalty providers\u2019 interpretation or understanding of the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements, guidelines or expectations may prove incorrect, which also could delay further or increase the cost of the approval process.\nOur potential milestone and royalty providers face uncertain results of clinical trials of product candidates.\nDrug development has inherent risk, and our potential milestone and royalty providers are required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target profiles before they can seek regulatory approvals for commercial use. It is possible our potential royalty providers may never receive regulatory approval for any licensed product candidates. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the resulting product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.\nOur potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates require significant additional research and development, extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. This process is lengthy and expensive, often taking a number of years. As clinical results frequently are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly. As a result, it is uncertain whether:\n\u25cf our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 future filings will be delayed;\n\u25cf our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 preclinical studies will be successful;\n\u25cf our potential milestone and royalty providers will be successful in generating viable product candidates;\n\u25cf we will be successful in finding collaboration and licensing partners to advance our product candidates on our behalf;\n\u25cf our potential milestone and royalty providers will be able to provide necessary data;\n\u25cf results of future clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers will justify further development; or\n\u25cf our potential milestone and royalty providers ultimately will achieve regulatory approval for product candidates in which we have an interest.\nThe timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes, including failure to complete preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials in a timely manner, inability to engage contract research organizations and other service providers, scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, changes in key personnel at clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria and shortages of available drug supply. In addition, since we and our royalty agreement counterparties license our product candidates to others to fund and conduct clinical trials, we, and they, have limited control over how quickly and efficiently such licensees advance those trials. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the concentration of patients in specialist centers, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments. Regardless of the initial size or relative complexity of a clinical trial, the costs of such trial may be higher than expected due to increases in duration or size of the trial, changes in the protocol under which the trial is being conducted, additional or special requirements of one or more of the healthcare centers where the trial is being conducted, or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the trial or in the standards or guidelines for approval of the product candidate being tested or for other unforeseen reasons.\nIn addition, our potential milestone and royalty providers may conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, which may subject them to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign clinical research organizations, and may expose our potential milestone and royalty providers to risks associated with foreign currency transactions to make contract payments denominated in the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted.\nNew products and technologies of other companies may render some or all of our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete.\nNew developments by others may render our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 product candidates or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Technologies developed and utilized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are changing continuously and substantially. Competition in antibody-based technologies is intense and is expected to increase in the future as a number of established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies advance in these fields. Many of these competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our potential milestone and royalty providers for many reasons, including that they may have:\n\u25cf significantly greater financial resources;\n\u25cf larger research and development staffs;\n\u25cf entered into arrangements with, or acquired, biotechnology companies to enhance their capabilities; or\n\u25cf extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials.\nThese factors may enable others to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own or those of our potential milestone and royalty providers. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or, for other reasons, later. As a result, we and our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to track development of competitive products, particularly at the early stages.\nPositive developments in connection with a potentially competing product may have an adverse impact on our future potential for receiving revenue derived from development milestones and royalties. For example, if another product\nis perceived to have a competitive advantage, or another product\u2019s failure is perceived to increase the likelihood that our licensed product will fail, our potential milestone and royalty providers may halt development of product candidates in which we have an interest.\nOur potential royalty providers may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for sales of our products, which would prevent our potential royalty providers\u2019 products from becoming profitable and negatively affect the royalties we may receive.\nIf our potential royalty providers succeed in bringing our product candidates to the market, they may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow our potential royalty providers to sell the products on a competitive basis. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which our potential royalty providers may obtain regulatory approval. Even if coverage is available, the associated reimbursement rate may not be adequate for our potential royalty providers to cover related marketing costs. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, the process of obtaining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly. Thus, even if our partners\u2019 product candidates are approved by the FDA, our royalty partners may not be able to price the products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for their products, which could adversely affect the royalties we receive.\nThird-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Our business is affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government controls on pricing.\nIn addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. We cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals or managed care efforts may have on our or our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 businesses.\nWe do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest.\nEven if product candidates in which we have an interest receive approval in the future, they may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, our potential royalty providers may experience difficulties in launching new products, many of which are novel and based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community. We have no assurance healthcare providers and patients will accept such products, if developed. Similarly, physicians may not accept a product if they believe other products to be more effective or more cost effective or are more comfortable prescribing other products.\nFurthermore, government agencies, as well as private organizations involved in healthcare, from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients. Such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect product usage directly (for example, by recommending a decreased dosage of a product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy) or indirectly (for example, by recommending a competitive product over a product in which we have an ownership or royalty interest). Consequently, we do not know if physicians or patients will adopt or use products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest for their approved indications.\nEven approved and marketed products are subject to risks relating to changes in the market for such products. Introduction or increased availability of generic or biosimilar versions of products can alter the market acceptance of branded products. In addition, unforeseen safety issues may arise at any time, regardless of the length of time a product has been on the market which may lead to litigation, increased costs and delays or removal of the product from the market.\nWe are exposed to an increased risk of product liability claims.\nThe testing, marketing and sales of medical products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability. In the past, we were party to product liability claims filed against Genentech Inc. and, even though Genentech agreed to indemnify us in connection with these matters and these matters have been settled, there can be no assurance other product liability lawsuits will not result in defense costs and/or liability to us or that our insurance or contractual arrangements will provide us with adequate protection against such liabilities. In the event of one or more large, unforeseen awards of damages against us, our product liability insurance may not provide adequate coverage. A significant product liability claim for which we were not adequately covered by insurance or indemnified by a third party would have to be paid from cash or other assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the value of our common stock. To the extent we have sufficient insurance coverage, such a claim would presumably result in higher subsequent insurance rates. In addition, product liability claims can have various other ramifications, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, including loss of future sales opportunities, discontinuation of clinical trials, increased costs associated with replacing products, a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, costs to defend litigation, and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business, each of which could also adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we and our potential royalty providers are unable to protect our intellectual property, in particular patent protection for principal products, product candidates and processes in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and prevent the use of the covered subject matter by third parties, our potential royalty providers\u2019 ability to compete in the market will be harmed, and we may not realize our profit potential.\nWe and our potential royalty providers rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products or product candidates. However, these means may afford only limited protection and may not:\n\u25cf prevent our competitors from duplicating our products and those of our potential royalty providers;\n\u25cf prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology and that of our potential royalty providers; or\n\u25cf permit us or our potential royalty providers to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.\nBecause of the length of time and the expense associated with bringing new products to the marketplace, we and our potential royalty providers hold and are in the process of applying for a number of patents in the United States and abroad to protect product candidates and important processes and also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the mere issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability.\nThe U.S. Federal Courts, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. The America Invents Act introduced post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us or our licensees may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. A decision in such proceedings adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIf our, and our potential royalty providers intellectual property rights are not protected adequately, our potential royalty providers may not be able to commercialize technologies or products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and our competitors could commercialize such technologies or products, which could result in a decrease in our potential royalty providers\u2019 sales and market share that would harm our business and operating results. Specifically, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.\nThe legal standards governing the validity of biotechnology patents are in transition, and current defenses as to issued biotechnology patents may not be adequate or available in the future. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to:\n\u25cf whether any pending or future patent applications held by us or our potential royalty providers will result in an issued patent, or whether issued patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies;\n\u25cf whether competitors will be able to design around our or our potential royalty providers\u2019 patents or develop and obtain patent protection for technologies, designs or methods that are more effective than those covered by our or our potential royalty providers\u2019 patents and patent applications; or\n\u25cf the extent to which our or our potential royalty providers\u2019 product candidates could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to costly litigation, result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, reduce the royalty rate due to us, and prevent our potential royalty providers from using our technology or product candidates.\nIf certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our potential royalty providers may require licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or may trigger contractual royalty offset clauses in our license agreements, or those of our royalty-agreement counterparties. We may become involved in litigation to determine the proprietary rights of others, and any such litigation will presumably be costly, time consuming, may not be adequately covered by insurance and may have other adverse effects on our business, such as inhibiting our potential royalty providers\u2019 ability to compete in the marketplace and absorbing significant management time.\nDue to the uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents, we also have relied and will continue to rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our employees and contractors are typically required to sign confidentiality agreements under which they agree not to use or disclose any of our proprietary information. Research and development contracts and relationships between us and our scientific consultants and potential licensees provide access to aspects of our know-how that are protected generally under confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality agreements may be breached or may not be enforced by a court. To the extent proprietary information is divulged to competitors or to the public generally, such disclosure may adversely affect our licensees\u2019 ability to develop or commercialize our products by giving others a competitive advantage or by undermining our patent position.\nIn addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and or applications will be due to the U.S. and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our and our licensees\u2019 patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside patent annuity service to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the U.S. and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property and/or the enforcement of our contractual rights against licensees and third parties can be costly and expose us to risks of counterclaims against us.\nWe may be required to engage in litigation or other proceedings to protect our intellectual property and/or enforce our contractual rights against former or current licensees or third parties, including third-party collaborators of such licensees. The cost to us of this litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial and parties to such litigation may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can if they have substantially greater resources than us. Such litigation and any negotiations leading up to it also may be time-consuming and could\ndivert management\u2019s attention and resources. If this litigation is resolved against us, we may lose the value associated with contract rights contained in our arrangements with licensees and third parties, our patents may be declared invalid, and we could be held liable for significant damages. While it is our current plan to pursue, on a selective basis, potential material contractual breaches against licensees and third parties (including third-party collaborators of licensees) and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights or technology, there can be no assurance that any such enforcement actions will be successful, or if successful, the timing of such success or that we will have sufficient capital to prosecute any such actions to a successful conclusion.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims that we, or our licensees, are infringing other parties\u2019 patents. If such claims are resolved against us, we or our licensees may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing products, processes or services unless we obtain a license from the other party. Such license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, thus preventing us, or our licensees, from using these products, processes or services and adversely affecting our potential future revenue.\nUncertainties resulting from our participation in intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the perceived value of the drug product candidates as to which we hold future potential milestone or royalty interests, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect of our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Employees, Location, Data Integrity, and Litigation\nThe loss of, COVID-19 related absence of, or changes in any of our key personnel, could delay or prevent achieving our objectives.\nOur business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss or COVID-19 related absence of one or more key members of our staff. We currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees. In addition, given our minimal employee base, a COVID-19 outbreak in our employee population could significantly hinder our ability to meet our operating objectives. Furthermore, in December 2021, we announced James R. Neal notified us of his decision to retire as our Chief Executive Officer, effective at the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, or (ii) the date we hire a new Chief Executive Officer. Changes in management may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance.\nBecause we are a small biopharmaceutical focused company with limited resources, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe had 12 employees as of March 3, 2022. We may require additional experienced executive, accounting, legal, administrative and other personnel from time to time in the future. We are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. There is intense competition for the services of these personnel, especially in California.\nMoreover, we expect the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may suffer and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively.\nWhile Mr. Neal has agreed to continue as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as per the terms of the separation agreement, there can be no assurance that a replacement will be found on a timely basis, or at all. Our inability to find a suitable replacement may have a detrimental impact on the organization and impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources.\nDue to our small number of employees, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources, as well as for certain of our functions as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the health care industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nNatural disasters, power shortages, power interruptions or other calamities at our Emeryville headquarters could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Emeryville, California. This location is in an area of seismic activity near active earthquake faults. Any earthquake, tsunami, terrorist attack, riot, fire, power shortage or other calamity affecting our facilities may disrupt our business and could have material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future licensees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could be the result of a cyberattacks and could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our development programs and other business operations. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Similarly, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of any of our product candidates could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nIf our information technology systems or data are or were compromised by data breaches, cyberattacks, or other security incidents our intellectual property or other sensitive information could be exposed or stolen and we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems, and those of our partners and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our data security and information technology systems, as well as those of our partners and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, that may expose sensitive data or personal information to unauthorized persons.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance and protection of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyberattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from a person with authorized access to our network, to an individual hacker, to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be intentional or accidental, generic or commodity in nature, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, customers and others which could expose us to liability under foreign, federal, or state privacy laws. Cyberattacks can result in the theft of proprietary information which could be used to compete against us and could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\nAuthorities worldwide have been warning businesses of increased cybersecurity threats from actors seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures that are intended to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Significant disruptions of information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with any privacy or data security obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.\nWe process sensitive and confidential information (including personal data), which subjects us to various obligations related to data privacy and security (e.g., U.S. and foreign law, regulations, guidance, industry standards, policies, contracts, and other obligations). For example, the EU implemented in 2018 the GDPR a broad data protection\nframework that expands the scope of current EU data protection law to non-European Union entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR allows for the imposition of fines and/or corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of EU subjects, including through a data security breach.\nIn the U.S., the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. Additionally, although not effective until January 1, 2023, the CPRA, which expands upon the CCPA, was passed in the election on November 3, 2020. The CCPA gives (and the CPRA will give) California residents expanded privacy rights, including the right to request correction, access and deletion of their personal information, the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, and the right to receive detailed information about how their information is processed. The CCPA and CPRA include a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action and will likely impact our business activities, along with increasing our compliance costs and potential liability. If we fail to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, which takes effect on July 1, 2023.\nComplying with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CDPA, CPA, or other laws, regulations, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and contractual or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, data transfers, data localization, or information security may require us to make changes to our business to enable us to meet new legal requirements, incur substantial operational costs, modify our data practices and policies, and restrict our business operations. Further, data incidents experienced by us, our partners or contractors could lead to significant fines, required corrective action, the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive clinical or commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, partners, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, or prevents access to, patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:\n\u25cf harm to our reputation;\n\u25cf fines imposed on us by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf additional compliance obligations under federal, state or foreign laws;\n\u25cf requirements for mandatory corrective action to be taken by us; and\n\u25cf requirements to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data.\nIn addition, cyber incidents can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Lastly, we cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven after FDA approval, a product may be subject to additional testing or significant marketing restrictions, its approval may be withdrawn or it may be removed voluntarily from the market.\nEven if our potential royalty providers receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, our licensees will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight and review by the FDA and other regulatory entities. The FDA, the EMA, or another regulatory agency may impose, as a condition of the approval, ongoing requirements for post-approval studies or post-approval obligations, including additional research and development and clinical trials, and the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency subsequently may withdraw approval based on these additional trials or obligations.\nEven for approved products, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and production of such product. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.\nFurthermore, marketing approval of a product may be withdrawn by the FDA, the EMA or another regulatory agency or such product may be withdrawn voluntarily by our potential royalty providers based, for example, on subsequently arising safety concerns. The FDA, EMA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nHealthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our potential royalty providers\u2019 ability to sell products in which we have ownership or and royalty interests, if approved, profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, former President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January l, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. On, June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how other such challenges, and the healthcare reform measures will impact the ACA and our business.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nAlso, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently in the U.S. over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS issued an interim final rule implementing former President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, and restrictions on certain product access. In some cases, such legislation and regulations have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nAn expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements for providers, and reduced product utilization, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We cannot know what form any such new legislation may take or the market\u2019s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent our potential royalty\nproviders from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, develop, or commercialize our current product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest.\nWe and our potential milestone and royalty providers are subject to various state and federal healthcare-related laws and regulations that if violated may impact the commercialization of our product candidates for which we possess milestone or royalty rights or could subject us to significant fines and penalties.\nOur operations may be directly or indirectly subject to various state and federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and state and federal data privacy and security laws. These laws may impact, among other things, the commercial operations for any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The ACA modified the federal Anti-Kickback Statute\u2019s intent requirement so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.\nThe federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Certain suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individual, commonly known as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, or \u201crelator\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend and/or settle a False Claims Act action.\nHIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private payor, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information by entities subject to the law, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf.\nMany states also have adopted laws similar to each of the federal laws described above, some of which apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Additionally, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. Further, some states have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA and differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws, and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nIf we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable state and federal healthcare laws, we or our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, reputational harm, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers\u2019 operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we and our licensees may be subject to certain analogous foreign laws and violations of such laws could result in significant penalties.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws including the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by the United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities or our business arrangements with third parties could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices or the business practices of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations or the operations of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, and we or marketers of products that generate our royalties may be required to curtail or restructure operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The risk\nof our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nAs we or our potential milestone and royalty providers do more business internationally, we will be subject to additional political, economic and regulatory uncertainties.\nWe or our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to operate successfully in any foreign market. We believe that because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature, international activities will be a significant part of future business activities and when and if we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are able to generate income, a substantial portion of that income will be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. Foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the United States, and an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could put us at a competitive disadvantage or make it uneconomical to proceed with a product or product candidate\u2019s development. International sales may be limited or disrupted by many factors, including without limitation:\n\u25cf imposition of government controls;\n\u25cf export license requirements;\n\u25cf political or economic instability;\n\u25cf trade restrictions;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs;\n\u25cf restrictions on repatriating profits;\n\u25cf exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf withholding and other taxation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur share price may be volatile, and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or our Series B Preferred Stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price. Additionally, there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. The market prices of biotechnology companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for biotechnology stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our stock price or the existence of an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 1, 2021, through March 3, 2022, the share price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $44.50 to a low of $19.08. From January 1, 2021, through March 3, 2022, the share price of our Series A Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of $27.57 to a low of $24.88. From April 12, 2021, through March 3, 2022, the share price of our Series B Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of $27.95 to a low of $24.05. Additionally, we have two significant holders of our common stock that could\naffect the liquidity of our stock and have a significant negative impact on our stock price if the holders were to quickly sell their ownership positions.\nOur results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations or an economic downturn.\nOur results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the U.S. financial markets have in the past contributed to, and may continue in the future contribute to, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. Domestic and international equity markets periodically experience heightened volatility and turmoil. These events may have an adverse effect on us. In the event of a market downturn, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline.\nWe have issued equity securities and may issue additional equity securities from time to time, that materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock, including our Series X preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe expect significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in such a manner as we determine from time to time, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement, as amended, and 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our existing securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 5,003 shares of Series X preferred stock issued and outstanding. Each share of Series X preferred stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of registered common stock. The total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued Series X preferred stock would be 5,003,000 shares. Each share is convertible at the option of the holder at any time, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting into common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own a number of shares above a conversion blocker, which was initially set at 19.99% of our total common stock then issued and outstanding immediately following the conversion of such shares. A holder of Series X preferred shares may elect to increase or decrease the conversion blocker above or below 19.99% on 61 days\u2019 notice, provided the conversion blocker does not exceed the limits under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(b), to the extent then applicable. If holders of our Series X convertible preferred stock elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock such conversion would dilute our currently outstanding common stock both in number and in earnings per share. BVF (and its affiliates), as current holders of all shares of our Series X preferred stock, would, if they converted all such shares to common stock, obtain majority voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2021, BVF owned approximately 31.2% of our total outstanding shares of common stock, and if all of the Series X convertible preferred shares were converted, BVF would own 52.3% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, as of April 9, 2021, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, funding from collaboration partners and others has in the past and may in the future involve issuance by us of our common stock. We cannot be certain how the purchase price of such shares, the relevant market price or premium, if any, will be determined or when such determinations will be made.\nAny issuance by us of equity securities, whether through an underwritten public offering, an at the market offering, a private placement, in connection with a collaboration or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares, and a decrease in the trading price of our securities.\nWe may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, which would result in dilution to our stockholders and/or debt securities which may impose restrictive covenants that would adversely impact our business. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution or result in other rights or obligations that adversely affect our stockholders. For example, holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to $2.15625 per year). Additionally, holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375% of the $25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to $2,093.75 per year per share or $2.09375 per year per depositary share). The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to our stockholders and may insulate our management from removal.\nOur charter and by-laws:\n\u25cf require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders, including nominating directors for election at those meetings; and\n\u25cf authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), that may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from merging or combining with us.\nThese provisions of our organizational documents and the DGCL, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock, could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests, and could make it considerably more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace management.\nAs a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have determined our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. We can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nCompanies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the SOX. Section 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), must contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax attributes will be substantially limited by Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\nUnder the federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law. In addition, Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, generally limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain other tax attributes against any taxable income in taxable periods after the ownership change. The amount of taxable income in each taxable year after the ownership change that may be offset by pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes is generally equal to the product of (a) the fair market value of the corporation\u2019s outstanding shares (or, in the case of a foreign corporation, the fair market value of items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States) immediately prior to the ownership change and (b) the long-term tax exempt rate (i.e., a rate of interest established by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that fluctuates from month to month). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the preceding three years.\nBased on an analysis under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which subjects the amount of pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes that can be utilized to an annual limitation), we experienced an ownership change in February 2017, when we completed an equity financing for net proceeds of $24.8 million that significantly impacted the availability of our tax attributes against future income. Further, due to the existence of a net unrealized built-in loss at the ownership change date, Section 382 further limits our ability to fully utilize the tax deductions associated with certain of our assets, including depreciation and amortization deductions recognized during the 60-month period following the ownership change ending in 2022. Although these deductions will occur in the post-change period, Section 382 treats the deductions as pre-change losses subject to the annual 382 limitation. As of December 31, 2021, we have excluded the NOLs and research and development credits that will expire as a result of the annual limitations. To the extent that we do not utilize our carry-forwards within the applicable statutory carry-forward periods, either because of Section 382 limitations or the lack of sufficient taxable income, the carry-forwards will also expire unused.\nThe 2017 tax reform law, as modified by 2020 tax legislation, and possible future changes in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, former President Trump signed into law comprehensive tax legislation (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Future guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which includes changes to the tax provisions that benefit business entities and makes certain technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On June 29, 2020, California Assembly Bill 85 (AB 85) was signed into law, which suspends the use of California net operating losses and limits the use of California research tax credits for tax years beginning in 2020 and before 2023. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CARES Act, or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. The foregoing items, as well as any other future changes in tax laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.\nStockholder and private lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurities-related class action and stockholder derivative litigation has often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs.\nIt is possible that suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. These potential lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant time and resources in the defense of these suits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with these lawsuits. Although we carry insurance to protect us from such claims, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position.\nMonitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions, including any currently pending litigation, are time-consuming for our management, are likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of any future litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of an investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 10333, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XOMA"}
