{"cik": "1129260", "company": "VOCERA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed if any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, actually occur. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past, and will likely experience losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past and reported a net loss of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $92.7 million. If we cannot achieve profitability in future periods, our business and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to be profitable in the future depends upon continued demand for our communication solutions from existing and new customers. Further market adoption of our solutions, including increased penetration within our existing customers, depends upon our ability to improve patient safety and satisfaction and increase hospital efficiency and productivity, and to bring value to customers outside of healthcare. Additionally, further adoption of our solutions in non-healthcare markets depends on our ability to modify our products to successfully respond to the challenges in those markets and our sales efforts to reach the customers in those markets. In addition, our profitability will be affected by, among other things, our ability to execute on our business strategy, the timing and size of orders, the pricing and costs of our solutions, macroeconomic conditions affecting the health care industry and the extent to which we invest in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative resources.\nWe depend on sales of our Vocera Communication solution in the healthcare market for substantially all of our revenue, and any further decrease in sales would harm our business.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales of our Vocera Communication solution to the healthcare market and, in particular, hospitals. Sales of our Vocera Communication solution to the healthcare market accounted for 90%, 91% and 92% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We anticipate that sales of our Vocera Communication solution will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Total product revenue declined 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to a decline in sales of our Vocera Communication Solution. A further decrease in revenue from sales of our Vocera Communications solution would harm our business.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our sales from existing hospital customers. While we are seeking to sell our Vocera Communications solution to non-healthcare customers, we do not anticipate that sales of our Vocera Communication solution in non-healthcare markets will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOur success depends in part upon the deployment of our Vocera Communication solution by new hospital customers, the expansion and upgrade of our solution at existing customers, and our ability to continue to provide on a timely basis cost-effective solutions that meet the requirements of our hospital customers. Our Vocera Communication solution requires a substantial upfront investment by customers. Typically, our hospital customers initially deploy our solution for specific users in specific departments before expanding our solution into other departments or for other users. The cost of the initial deployment depends on the number of users and departments involved, the size and age of the hospital and the condition of the existing wireless infrastructure, if any, within the hospital.\nEven if hospital personnel determine that our Vocera Communication solution provides compelling benefits over their existing communications methods, their hospitals may not have, or may not be willing to spend, the resources necessary to install and maintain wireless infrastructure to initially deploy and support our solution or expand our solution to other departments or users. Hospitals are currently facing significant budget constraints from unpredictable patient population trends and commercial reimbursements, and increasing demands from, and competition for, patients. In addition, hospitals, including both governmental and commercial, are experiencing declining Medicare reimbursement rates and increasing compliance demands, and penalties from the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) and other healthcare reform legislation. As a consequence, we may continue to experience a slowdown and deferral of orders for our Vocera Communication solution that could negatively impact our sales. We believe hospitals are currently prioritizing allocation of funds for capital and infrastructure improvements to benefit from electronic health records incentives and for compliance with ICD-10 diagnosis coding requirements, which may impact their ability to purchase and deploy our solution. We might not be able to sustain or increase our revenue from sales of our Vocera Communication solution, or achieve the growth rates that we envision, if hospitals continue to face significant budgetary constraints and reduce their spending on communications systems.\nOur sales cycle can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our solutions, including the technical capabilities of our solutions and the potential cost savings and productivity gains achievable by deploying them. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our solutions but also their existing communications methods and those of our competitors, and can result in a lengthy sales cycle of nine to twelve months or more. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any\nassurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our solutions are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. For example, we experienced elongated sales cycles due to uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform and lower hospital admission trends in 2013 and 2014. At this time, hospitals in the U.S. face significant uncertainty over the continuing impact of federal government budgets, and continuing changes in the implementation and deadlines for compliance with the ACA and other healthcare reform legislation, as well as potential future statutes and rulemaking.\nOur business has gone through cycles of expansion, relative stability and contraction, and if we are not able to manage such cycles effectively, our operating results may suffer.\nWe have experienced periods of expansion, relative stability and contraction in our revenues and operations in the past. Such fluctuation has placed, and may continue to place, strains on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Especially during growth periods, we may plan to hire additional direct sales and marketing personnel domestically and internationally, acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets, and increase our investment in research and development. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully implement such plans and manage such investments. To do so successfully we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nmanage our expenses in line with our operating plans and current business environment;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nintegrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022\nmanage operations in multiple locations and time zones; and\n\u2022\ndevelop and deliver new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions efficiently and reliably.\nWe expect to incur costs associated with the investments made to support our business strategy before the anticipated benefits or the returns are realized, if at all. If we are unable to grow our business or manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions. We may also fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in lower revenue and a decline in the share price of our common stock.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to fluctuate, making our quarterly results difficult to predict, which may cause us to miss analyst expectations and may result in the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results have been and may continue to be difficult to predict, even in the near term, and are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nComparisons of our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Each of the following factors, among others, could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter:\n\u2022\nthe financial health of our healthcare customers and budgetary constraints on their ability to upgrade their communications;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment affecting our healthcare customers, including impediments to their ability to obtain reimbursement for their services;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our sales and marketing operations;\n\u2022\nthe procurement and deployment cycles of our healthcare customers and the length of our sales cycles;\n\u2022\nvariations in the amount of orders booked in a prior quarter but not delivered until later quarters;\n\u2022\nour mix of solutions and pricing, including discounts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand into non-healthcare markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop impactful reseller partnerships;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and manage lead times for the manufacture of our solutions; and\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions that achieve market acceptance.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry and governing regulations have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from customers in the healthcare industry, in particular, hospitals. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Developments generally affecting the healthcare industry, including new regulations or new interpretations of existing regulations, could adversely affect spending on information technology and capital equipment by reducing funding, changing healthcare pricing or delivery or creating impediments for obtaining healthcare reimbursements, which together with declining admission trends,\ncould cause our sales to decline and negatively impact our business. For example, the profit margins of our hospital customers are modest, and pending changes in reimbursement for healthcare costs may reduce the overall solvency of our customers or cause further deterioration in their financial or business condition.\nSince 2009, three significant bills were signed into law that impact the U.S. healthcare system. Those bills include The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted under Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (HITECH Act), the ACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Together, these acts drive substantive changes over several years to the operating processes, reimbursements and rules governing the U.S. healthcare system. The actual end effect of these laws on the marketplace is not yet fully understood.\nWe believe that our healthcare customers are unsure of the impact that a number of the elements of those acts will have on their business, and cannot predict the timing and requirements of the final rules issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for these statutes, making managing their business operations more difficult. Further, as has been experienced since 2010, as rules and agency guidance pursuant to these statutes are implemented and revised by HHS, a number of aspects of the acts have been interpreted, modified or delayed. For example, sudden changes in the rules for individuals buying insurance through state or federal health insurance exchanges, and individual and employer mandates to have and offer insurance coverage, have challenged hospitals\u2019 abilities to forecast patient utilization and revenues, and to set operational plans and budget accordingly.\nFederal budget activities also impact our customers. We believe that it is likely that additional legislative changes by Congress and rulemaking by HHS will continue. In addition, many state governments are changing or expanding their healthcare laws, adding additional complexity to understanding the potential impacts.\nWe are unable to predict the full impact of these new and changing rules on our hospital customers and others in the healthcare industry. Impacts of these rules have affected and could continue to affect materially our customers\u2019 ability to budget for or purchase our products. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. We cannot provide assurance that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nWe primarily compete in the rapidly evolving and competitive healthcare market, and if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe believe that at this time the primary competition for our Vocera Communication solution consists of traditional methods using wired and wireless phones, pagers and overhead intercoms. While we believe that our system is superior to these legacy methods, our solution requires a significant infrastructure investment by a hospital and many hospitals' spending is severely constrained by other priorities.\nManufacturers and distributors of product categories such as cellular phones, smartphone applications, pagers, mobile radios and in-building wireless telephones attempt to sell their products to hospitals as components of an overall communication system. Of these product categories, in-building wireless telephones represent the most significant competition for the sale of our solution. The market for in-building wireless phones is dominated by communications companies such as Cisco Systems, Ascom and Spectralink. In addition, the proliferation of smartphones and related applications may represent a new category of competitive offerings. While we consider secured text-messaging using smartphones a feature valued by many customers, we do not believe most of our potential customers would consider that feature alone an adequate substitute for a voice communication solution. However, some customers may choose free text-messaging solutions even if not HIPAA-compliant, given their budget constraints.\nWhile we do not have a directly comparable competitor that provides a solution as richly-featured as the Vocera Communication system for the healthcare market, we could face such competition in the future. Potential competitors in the healthcare or communications markets include large, multinational companies with significantly more resources to dedicate to product development and sales and marketing. These companies may have existing relationships within the hospital, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. Customers may prefer to purchase a more highly integrated or bundled solution from a single provider or an existing supplier rather than a new supplier, regardless of performance or features. Accordingly, if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, we could experience pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, higher sales and marketing expenses, lower revenue and the loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf we fail to increase market awareness of our brand and solutions, and expand our sales and marketing operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to add personnel and resources in sales and marketing as we focus on expanding awareness of our brand and solutions and capitalize on sales opportunities with new and existing customers. Our efforts to improve sales of our solutions will result in an increase in our sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense, and these efforts may not be successful. Some newly hired sales and marketing personnel may subsequently be determined to be unproductive and have to be replaced, resulting in operational and sales delays and incremental costs. If we are unable to significantly increase the awareness of our brand and solutions or effectively manage the costs associated with these efforts, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality services and support for any of our solutions, our ability to sell those solutions will be harmed.\nOur ability to sell our Vocera Communication or Care Experience solutions is dependent upon our professional services and technical support teams providing high-quality services and support. Our professional services team assists our customers with their wireless infrastructure assessment, clinical workflow design, communication solution configuration, training and project management during the pre-deployment and deployment stages. Once our solutions are deployed within a customer\u2019s facility, the customer typically depends on our technical support team to help resolve technical issues, assist in optimizing the use of our solutions and facilitate adoption of new functionality. If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical and other post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support services, our ability to expand the use of our solutions with existing customers and to sell our solutions to new customers will be harmed. If deployment of our solutions is unsatisfactory, as has been the case with certain third-party deployments in the past, we may incur significant costs to attain and sustain customer satisfaction. As we rapidly hire new services and support personnel, we may inadvertently hire underperforming people who will have to be replaced, or fail to effectively train such employees, leading in some instances to slower growth, additional costs and poor customer relations. In addition, the failure of channel partners to provide high-quality services and support in markets outside the United States could also harm sales of our solutions.\nWe depend on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers, and if we are unable to source our components from them, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe depend on sole and limited source suppliers for several hardware components of our Vocera Communication solution, including our batteries and integrated circuits. We purchase inventory generally through individual purchase orders. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. These suppliers typically rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers, and as a result, even if available, the supplier may not be able to secure sufficient materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our components in a timely manner. Any of these circumstances could cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of our solutions to our customers, and this may force us to seek components from alternative sources, which may not have the required specifications, or be available in time to meet demand or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any of these circumstances may also force us to redesign our solutions if a component becomes unavailable in order to incorporate a component from an alternative source.\nOur solutions incorporate multiple software components obtained from licensors on a non-exclusive basis, such as voice recognition software, software supporting the runtime execution of our software platform, and database and reporting software. Our license agreements can be terminated for cause. In many cases, these license agreements specify a limited term and are only renewable beyond that term with the consent of the licensor. If a licensor terminates a license agreement for cause, objects to its renewal or conditions renewal on modified terms and conditions, we may be unable to obtain licenses for equivalent software components on reasonable terms and conditions, including licensing fees, warranties or protection from infringement claims. Some licensors may discontinue licensing their software to us or support of the software version used in our solutions. In such circumstances, we may need to redesign our solutions at substantial cost to incorporate alternative software components or be subject to higher royalty costs. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect the cost and availability of our solutions.\nThird-party licensors generally require us to incorporate specific license terms and conditions in our agreements with our customers. If we are alleged to have failed to incorporate these license terms and conditions, we may be subject to claims by these licensors, incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such claims and, if such claims are successful, be subject to termination of licenses, monetary damages, or an injunction against the continued distribution of one or more of our solutions.\nBecause we depend upon a contract manufacturer, our operations could be harmed and we could lose sales if we encounter problems with this manufacturer.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a contract manufacturer, SMTC, to produce the primary hardware component of our Vocera Communication solution. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with SMTC that is terminable by either party with advance notice and that may also be terminated for a material uncured breach. We also rely on original design manufacturers, or ODMs, to produce accessories, including batteries, chargers and attachments. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. If SMTC or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions in the volumes that we require, fails to meet our quality specifications or significantly increases its prices, we may not be able to deliver our solutions to our customers with the quantities, quality and performance that they expect in a timely manner. As a result, we could lose sales and our operating results could be harmed.\nSMTC or ODMs may experience problems that could impact the quantity and quality of components of our Vocera Communication solution, including disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, component or material shortages and cost increases. SMTC and these ODMs generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers, and as a result, may not be able to secure sufficient components or other materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build components of our solutions in a timely manner. The majority of the components of our Vocera Communication solution are manufactured in Asia or Mexico and adverse changes in political or economic circumstances in those locations could also disrupt our supply and quality of components of our solutions.\nCompanies occasionally encounter unexpected difficulties in ramping up production of new products, and we may experience such difficulties with future generations of our products. SMTC and our ODMs also manufacture products for other companies. Generally, our orders represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by SMTC and these ODMs from their customers; therefore, fulfilling our orders may not be a priority in the event SMTC or an ODM is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations. In addition, if SMTC or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions, we may have to identify one or more alternative manufacturers. The process of identifying and qualifying a new contract manufacturer or ODM can be time consuming, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, transitioning to a new manufacturer may cause us to incur additional costs and delays if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing components of our solutions to our specifications or quality standards.\nIf we fail to forecast our manufacturing requirements accurately, or fail to properly manage our inventory with our contract manufacturer, we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays, which can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe place orders with our contract manufacturer, SMTC, and we and SMTC place orders with suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand. Because of our international low cost sourcing strategy, our lead times are long and cause substantially more risk to forecasting accuracy than would result were lead times shorter. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates affecting our ability to meet our customers' demands for our solutions. We also may face additional forecasting challenges due to product transitions in the components of our solutions, or to our suppliers discontinuing production of materials and subcomponents required for our solutions. If demand for our solutions increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to source additional materials and subcomponents to produce components of our solutions or to expedite the manufacture and delivery of additional inventory. If we underestimate customer demand, our contract manufacturer may have inadequate materials and subcomponents on hand to produce components of our solutions, which could result in manufacturing interruptions, shipment delays, deferral or loss of revenue, and damage to our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we and SMTC may purchase more inventory than required for actual customer orders, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory, thereby increasing our costs and harming our operating results.\nIf hospitals do not have and are not willing to install, upgrade and maintain the wireless infrastructure required to effectively operate our Vocera Communication solution, then they may experience technical problems or not purchase our solution at all.\nThe effectiveness of our Vocera Communication solution depends upon the quality and compatibility of the communications environment that our healthcare customers maintain. Our solutions require voice-grade wireless, or Wi-Fi, installed through\nlarge enterprise environments, which can vary from hospital to hospital and from department to department within a hospital. Many hospitals have not installed a voice-grade wireless infrastructure. If potential customers do not have a wireless network that can properly and fully interoperate with our Vocera Communication solution, then such a network must be installed, or an existing Wi-Fi network must be upgraded or modified, for example, by adding access points in stairwells, for our Vocera Communication solution to be fully functional. The additional cost of installing or upgrading a Wi-Fi network may dissuade potential customers from installing our solution. Furthermore, if changes to a customer's physical or information technology environment cause integration issues or degrade the effectiveness of our solution, or if the customer fails to upgrade or maintain its environment as may be required for software releases or updates or to ensure our solution's effectiveness, the customer may not be able to fully utilize our solution or may experience technical problems, or these changes may impact the performance of other wireless equipment being used. If such circumstances arise, prospective customers may not purchase or existing customers may not expand their use of or deploy upgraded versions of our Vocera Communication solution, thereby harming our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain certification for certain U.S. federal standards, our sales to U.S. government customers will suffer.\nWe believe that a significant opportunity exists to sell our products to healthcare facilities in the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (DoD). These customers require independent certification of compliance with specific requirements relating to encryption, security, interoperability and scalability, including Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and, as to DoD, certification by its Joint Interoperability and Test Command and under its Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process. We have received certification under certain of these standards for military-specific configurations of the Vocera communication solution incorporating the B2000 and B3000 badges. We are continuing to carry out further compliance activities. A failure on our part to achieve and maintain compliance, both as to current products and as to new product versions, could adversely impact our revenue.\nOur efforts to sell our communications solutions in non-healthcare markets may not be successful.\nIn recent years, we have actively engaged in sales efforts to customers outside the healthcare markets, including hospitality, energy and other mobile work environments. We may not be successful in further penetrating the non-healthcare markets upon which we are initially focusing, or other new markets. To date, our Vocera Communication solution has been deployed in over 250 customers in non-healthcare markets. Total revenue from non-healthcare customers accounted for 3% of our revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. If we cannot maintain these customers by providing communications solutions that meet their requirements, if we cannot successfully expand our communications solutions in non-healthcare markets, or if adoption of our solutions is slow, we may not obtain significant revenue from these markets. We may experience challenges as we expand in non-healthcare markets, including pricing pressure on our solutions and technical issues as we adapt our solutions for the requirements of new markets. Our communications solutions also may not contain the functionality required by these non-healthcare markets or may not sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions.\nIf we fail to successfully develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions that meet existing and new customer requirements. We may not be able to develop and introduce new solutions or features on a timely basis or in response to customers\u2019 changing requirements, or that sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions. We may experience technical problems and additional costs as we introduce new features to our software platform, deploy future models of our wireless badges and integrate new solutions with existing customer clinical systems and workflows. In addition, we may face technical difficulties as we expand into non-English speaking countries and incorporate non-English speech recognition capabilities into our Vocera Communication solution. We also may incur substantial costs or delays in the manufacture of any additional new products or models as we seek to optimize production methods and processes at our contract manufacturer. In addition, we expect that we will at least initially achieve lower gross margins on new models, while endeavoring to reduce manufacturing costs over time. If any of these problems were to arise, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits from our acquisitions or if we cannot successfully integrate them, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have acquired, and in the future may acquire, complementary businesses, technologies or assets that we believe to be strategic, such as our acquisitions of mVisum in the first quarter of 2014 and Prana Technologies in the third quarter of 2014.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits, or be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, technologies or assets. If we cannot effectively integrate the acquired business and products into our business, we may not achieve market acceptance for, or significant revenue from, these new solutions.\nIntegrating newly acquired businesses, technologies and assets could strain our resources, could be expensive and time consuming, and might not be successful. Our recent acquisitions expose us, and we will be further exposed, if we acquire or invest in additional businesses, technologies or assets, to a number of risks, including that we may:\n\u2022\nexperience technical issues as we integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets into our existing communications solutions;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties leveraging our existing sales and marketing organizations, and direct sales channels, to increase our revenue from acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022\nfind that the acquisition does not further our business strategy, we overpaid for the acquisition or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed;\n\u2022\nhave difficulty retaining the key personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nsuffer disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management's attention as a result of transition or integration issues and the challenges of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; and\n\u2022\nexperience unforeseen and significant problems or liabilities associated with quality, technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquisition, such as intellectual property or employment matters.\nIn addition, from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options and warrants, the ownership of existing stockholders would be diluted. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, large write-offs, or other unanticipated costs, events or circumstances, any of which could harm our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from maintenance and support contracts over the contract term, and changes in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our customer maintenance and support contracts ratably over the contract term, which is typically 12 months, in some cases subject to an early termination right. Revenue from our maintenance and support contracts accounted for 37%, 31% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to maintenance and support contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed maintenance and support by our customers in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the continuing services of our senior management and other key personnel, and our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, sales and marketing. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the Silicon Valley where our headquarters are located. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, our ability to grow our business could be harmed.\nThe members of our senior management and other key personnel are at-will employees, and may terminate their employment at any time without notice. If one or more members of our senior management terminate their employment, we may not be able to find qualified individuals to replace them on a timely basis or at all and our senior management may need to divert their attention from other aspects of our business. Former employees may also become employees of a competitor. We may also have to pay additional compensation to attract and retain key personnel. We also anticipate hiring additional engineering, marketing and sales, and services personnel to grow our business. Often, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train these personnel. We may incur significant costs to attract, integrate and retain them, and we may lose them to a competitor or another company before we realize the benefit of our investments in them.\nOur international operations subject us, and may increasingly subject us in the future, to operational, financial, economic and political risks abroad.\nAlthough we derive a relatively small portion of our revenue from customers outside the United States, we believe that non-U.S. customers could represent an increasing share of our revenue in the future. During the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and 2012, we generated 9.9%, 10.5% and 10.7% of our revenue, respectively, from customers outside of the United States, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand. In the second quarter of 2014, we opened a new innovation center in India and a sales office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business solely in the United States, including:\n\u2022\nchallenges incorporating non-English speech recognition capabilities into our solutions as we expand into non-English speaking jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating our solutions with wireless infrastructures with which we do not have experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating local dialing plans and applicable PBX standards;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with delivering support, training and documentation in several languages;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing personnel and resellers;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including increasingly stringent data privacy regulations, requirements for export controls for encryption technology, employment laws, changes in tax laws and tax audits by government agencies;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in, or foreign conflicts that involve or affect, the countries of our customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022\nexposure to competitors who are more familiar with local markets;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance;\n\u2022\nlimited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in some countries; and\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, which could affect the price of our solutions relative to locally produced solutions.\nAny of these factors could harm our existing international business, impair our ability to expand into international markets or harm our operating results.\nOur solutions are highly complex and may contain software or hardware defects that could harm our reputation and operating results.\nOur solutions incorporate complex technology, are deployed in a variety of complex hospital environments and must interoperate with many different types of devices and hospital systems. While we test the components of our solutions for defects and errors prior to release, we or our customers may not discover a defect or error until after we have deployed our solution, integrated it into the hospital environment and our customer has commenced general use of the solution. In addition, our solutions in some cases are integrated with hardware and software offered by \u201cmiddleware\u201d vendors in order to interoperate with nurse call systems, device alarms and other hospital systems. If we cannot successfully integrate our solution with these vendors as needed or if any hardware or software of these vendors contains any defect or error, then our solution may not perform as designed, or may exhibit a defect or error.\nAny defects or errors in, or which are attributed to, our solutions, could result in:\n\u2022\ndelayed market acceptance of our affected solutions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of engineering or other resources for remedying the defect or error;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand and reputation;\n\u2022\ndelay in delivery of information;\n\u2022\nincreased service and warranty costs, including potential replacement costs for product recalls; and\n\u2022\nlegal actions by our customers and hospital patients, including product liability claims.\nIf any of these occur, our operating results and reputation could be harmed.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information collected through our solutions.\nIn connection with our healthcare communications business, we handle and have access to personal health information subject in the United States to HIPAA or HITECH, regulations issued pursuant to these statutes, state privacy and security laws and regulations, and associated contractual obligations as a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of healthcare providers. These statutes, regulations\nand contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we must comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these statutes, regulations and contractual obligations as we develop our solutions, a failure by us to comply with their requirements (e.g., evolving encryption and security requirements) or an allegation that defects in our products have resulted in noncompliance by our customers could create material civil and/or criminal liability for us, resulting in adverse publicity and negatively affecting our business.\nIn addition, the use and disclosure of personal health information is subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in which we do business or expect to do business in the future. Those jurisdictions may attempt to apply their laws, including new and modified laws enacted in the future, extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities and we might unintentionally violate these laws. Any such developments, or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws, or the failure by us to comply with their requirements or to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these laws could create material liability to us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nFor example, the EU adopted the DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the storage of personally identifiable information on computers or recorded on other electronic media. This has been implemented by all EU member states through national laws. DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states. Similarly, Canada\u2019s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act, as well as a variety of provincial statutes, provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. A finding that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nAny legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information could affect the way we operate our services and could harm our business. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our solutions or increase the costs associated with selling our solutions, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop solutions in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Further, we cannot assure you that our privacy and security policies and practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.\nThe failure of our equipment lease customers to pay us under leasing agreements with them that we do not sell to third party lease finance companies could harm our revenue and operating results.\nIn 2012 we began offering our badges and related hardware accessories to our customers through multi-year equipment lease agreements. In connection with each sale, we recognize product-related revenue at the net present value of the lease payment stream once our obligations related to such sale have been met. We plan to sell the bulk of these leases, including the related accounts receivables, to third party lease finance companies on a non-recourse basis. We will have to retain unsold leases in-house, which will expose us to the creditworthiness of such equipment lease customers over the lease term. For the leases that we retain in-house, our ability to collect payments from a customer or to recognize revenue for the sale could be impaired if the customer fails to meet its obligations to us such as in the case of its bankruptcy filing or deterioration in its financial position, or has other creditworthiness issues, any of which could harm our revenue and operating results.\nOur use of open source and non-commercial software components could impose risks and limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nOur solutions contain software modules licensed under open source and other types of non-commercial licenses, including the GNU Public License, the Apache License and others. We also may incorporate open source and other licensed software into our solutions in the future. Use and distribution of such software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as licenses of these types generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some of these licenses require the release of our proprietary source code to the public if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. This could allow competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately result in a loss of sales for us.\nThe terms of many open source and other non-commercial licenses have not been judicially interpreted and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In such event, in order to continue offering our solutions, we could be required to seek licenses from alternative licensors, which may not be available on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event we cannot obtain a license or re-engineer our solutions on a timely basis,\nany of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, if an owner of licensed software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the corresponding license agreement, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be required to disclose our source code, or be enjoined from the distribution of our solutions.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement could harm our business.\nVigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies in our industry. Although claims of this kind have not materially affected our business to date, there can be no assurance of the absence of such claims in the future. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to many other industry participants, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence.\nMany potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary technology through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries. We also protect our proprietary technology through licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. These protections may not be available in all cases or may be inadequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or solutions in an unauthorized manner. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, or superior, to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nTo prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than us. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. While we plan to continue to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\ncurrent or future U.S. or foreign patent applications will be approved;\n\u2022\nour issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we develop technology, or we or our competitors operate; or\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us.\nOur failure to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation of our patents, or our inability to protect any of our intellectual property, may weaken our competitive position and harm our business and operating results. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct liability or other liability claims could cause us to incur significant costs, adversely affect the sales of our solutions and harm our reputation.\nOur solutions are utilized by healthcare professionals and others in the course of providing patient care. It is possible that patients, family members, physicians, nurses or others may allege we are responsible for harm to patients or healthcare professionals due to defects in, the malfunction of, the characteristics of, or the operation of, our solutions. Any such allegations could harm our reputation and ability to sell our solutions.\nOur solutions utilize lithium-ion batteries and electronic components that may overheat or otherwise malfunction as a result of physical or environmental damage. Components of our solutions emit radio frequency (RF) emissions which have been alleged, in connection with cellular phones, to have adverse health consequences. Magnets in our badges may emit electromagnetic radiation and may be alleged to interfere with implanted medical or other devices. While these components of our solutions comply with applicable guidelines, some may allege that these components of our solutions cause adverse health consequences. Also, applicable guidelines may change making these components of our solutions non-compliant. Any such allegations or non-compliance, or any regulatory developments, could negatively impact the sales of our solutions, require costly modifications to our solutions, and harm our reputation.\nAlthough our customer agreements contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our potential liability, we could be required to spend significant amounts of management time and resources to defend ourselves against product liability, tort, warranty or other claims. If any such claims were to prevail, we could be forced to pay damages, comply with injunctions or stop distributing our solutions. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management's attention away from our business. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions; however, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on acceptable terms. Further, the insurer could attempt to disclaim coverage as to any particular claim.\nSome of our solutions are, and others could become, subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or similar foreign agencies, which could increase our operating costs.\nWe provide certain products that are, and others that may become, subject to regulation by the FDA and similar agencies in other countries, or the jurisdiction of these agencies could be expanded in the future to include our solutions. The FDA regulates certain products, including software-based products, as \u201cmedical devices\u201d based, in part, on the intended use of the product and the risk the device poses to the patient should the device fail to perform properly. Although we have concluded that our wireless badge is a general-purpose communications device not subject to FDA regulation, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion, or changes in our solutions or the FDA\u2019s evolving regulation could lead to FDA regulation of our solutions. Any of our products deemed to be medical devices would be subject to the 2.3% excise tax under the ACA. Canada and many other countries in which we sell or may sell our solutions could also have similar regulations applicable to our solutions, some of which may be subject to change or interpretation. We may incur substantial operating costs if we are required to register our solutions or components of our solutions as regulated medical devices under U.S. or foreign regulations, obtain premarket approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, and satisfy the extensive reporting requirements. In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions and monetary penalties. A clinical communications product acquired from mVisum is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and many critical components of our solutions are sourced in Asia and Mexico, regions known to suffer natural disasters. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, occurring at our headquarters, our other facilities or where our contract manufacturer or its suppliers are located, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce located worldwide, and in particular,\nour senior management, general and administrative, and research and development activities that are coordinated with our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Any disruption to our internal communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Asia or Mexico could delay our research and development efforts, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or delay deployment of our solutions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may require additional capital to support our business growth, and such capital may not be available.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, which include the need to develop new solutions or enhance existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, expand into non-healthcare markets, and acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure funds. Equity and debt financing, however, might not be available when needed or, if available, might not be available on terms satisfactory to us. If we raise additional funds through equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited as we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our initiatives, which could harm our operating results.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and may, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and governance requirements.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), we are permitted to, and may, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and governance requirements. For example, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, which can last, at most, until the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, we will not be required to:\n\u2022\nhave our independent registered public accounting firm report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act);\n\u2022\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nprovide the \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d and certain compensation tables for our named executive officers in our Form 10-K or annual proxy statement; and\n\u2022\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and \u201csay on frequency.\u201d\nWe could be an emerging growth company until the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. However, if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30th of any year, we could cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31st. This threshold was not reached for June 30, 2014. After exceeding the threshold, as of each fiscal year end, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While management has established plans to accommodate the additional assessment and attestation procedures and related costs of Section 404(b) compliance, we may incur additional costs or require additional management time to comply with Section 404(b) in a timely manner.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we must obtain confidence in our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the extent we find a material weakness or other deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMultiple negative consequences could ensue if a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is identified in the future, or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or we do not maintain effective controls. For example, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could be restated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our controls from our independent registered public accounting firm (once such opinion is required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), or we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. All of these outcomes would require additional financial and management resources, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nWe will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance obligations.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses, even though we as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d may rely upon the disclosure and governance exemptions under the JOBS Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and our stock exchange, impose various requirements on public companies, including certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations, along with compliance with accounting principles and regulatory interpretations of such principles, as amended by the JOBS Act, have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. For example, on August 1, 2013 and August 21, 2013, purported securities class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our officers, our board of directors, a former director and the underwriters for our initial public offering. The suits purport to allege claims for allegedly misleading statements in the registration statement for our initial public offering and in subsequent communications regarding our business and financial results. Regardless of the outcome, these matters or future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe SEC \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rule has caused us to incur additional expenses, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products and could make us less competitive in our target markets.\nWe are required to disclose the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The SEC requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, engage in supply chain due diligence and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report on Form SD covering the prior calendar year. The rule could limit our ability to source at competitive prices and to secure sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, as the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain.\nRisks related to our common stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variation in anticipated operating results of us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new solutions, new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, technologies or assets by us or our competitor;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour public float relative to the total number of shares of our common stock that are issued and outstanding;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management;\n\u2022\nunfavorable economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our company, we could lose visibility in the financial market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities or industry analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that stockholders consider favorable and cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that the stockholders of our company consider favorable. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from cumulating their votes for the election of directors;\n\u2022\npermit newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by majority vote of our remaining directors, even if less than a quorum is then in office;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for \u201ccause\u201d and only with the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3rds percent of our outstanding stock; and\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.", "PERMNO": 13316, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "VCRA"}
