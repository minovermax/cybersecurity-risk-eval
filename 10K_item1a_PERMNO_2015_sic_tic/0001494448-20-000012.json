{"cik": "1494448", "company": "EMERGENT CAPITAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness & Organizational Structure\nWe may not have sufficient funds to pay our debt and other obligations.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and operating cash flows may be inadequate to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our other obligations. The A&R LPA provides generally that holders of the Class A and Class B Interests receive distributions of proceeds of the assets of White Eagle based on their 72.5% and 27.5% ownership, respectively, after certain expenses and reserves are funded (including such minimum payments to Lamington totaling approximately $8.0 million per year for the first three (3) years and $4.0 million for the subsequent seven (7) years), provided that commencing after year three (3), such minimum payments will be utilized to repay the Class D Return of $8.0 million, which was advanced at closing, plus the greater of $2.0 million or 11% per annum on such $8.0 million to the extent necessary to fully repay such Class D Return. The minimum payments to the Company will occur regardless of maturities with payments through the premium/expense reserve account when there are no maturity proceeds available for distributions as described below). However, the A&R LPA also provides that all payments to holders of the Class B interests (other than such minimum payments to Lamington during the first eight (8) years following the Closing Date) are fully subordinated to payments in respect of the minimum returns to holders of the Class A and Class D interests (including repayment of all amounts advanced in respect of the Advance Facility). Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to when proceeds will be received from the WE Investment.\nOur substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nAs of November 30, 2019, we had $123.4 million in outstanding long-term debt (including that held by our subsidiaries and without giving effect to the fair value of such indebtedness) consisting of our 5.0% senior unsecured convertible notes due 2023 (the \" New Convertible Notes\") and the 8.5% senior secured notes due 2021 (the \"8.5% Senior Secured Notes\"). Our substantial level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to you and us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our debt obligations, including payment of current interest obligations;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty refinancing our existing indebtedness or obtaining financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; and\n\u2022\nour leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWhile the terms of the financing arrangements governing our debt contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future; the more we increase our leverage, the more we become exposed to the risks described above.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner that we own our life settlements and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States, Ireland and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax proceeds from companies. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for intercompany arrangements and ownership of life settlements, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and state authorities and from 2014 on, foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a material negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We have been adversely impacted by the GILTI tax described below and are considering various options of restructuring the business in order to mitigate this; however, there can be no assurance that such mitigation will be achieved quickly or at all.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe U.S., Ireland and many countries in the European Union, are actively considering and implementing changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals, including proposals with retroactive effects, could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations where we do business or where our subsidiaries own life insurance policies. Any changes in the taxation of either international business activities or ownership of life settlements may increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (the \"TCJA\"). The TCJA is complex and includes significant amendments to the Code, including amendments that drastically changed the taxation of offshore earnings and the deductibility of interest. The Company has assessed the impact of the TCJA on its business and consolidated financial statements. In connection with that ongoing assessment, the Company has identified provisions that impact the Company, some of which have had a material and adverse effect on its business.\nFirst, the TCJA generally required the Company to include in income with respect to its 2017 taxable year any undistributed and previously untaxed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries existing at December 31, 2017, subject to adjustments.\nSecond, and applicable in the year ended November 30, 2019, the TCJA generally will subject the Company to a current U.S. tax on any undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be \"global intangible low-taxed income\" (\"GILTI\"), subject to certain deductions and adjustments.\nThird, the TCJA generally will disallow the Company's U.S. interest deductions going forward to the extent such deductions exceed 30% of its U.S. \"adjusted taxable income\" (which will be roughly equivalent to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") through 2022 and to earnings before interest and tax (\"EBIT\") thereafter).\nFourth, any net operating loss incurred by the Company in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 cannot offset more than 80% of the Company\u2019s taxable income in any tax year and cannot be carried back to offset prior year taxable income.\nFinally, the TCJA significantly amends Section 162(m) of the Code. Pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may not deduct compensation of more than $1.0 million paid to the Company\u2019s \"covered employees,\" which includes (i) any individual who at any time during the taxable year is a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or an employee whose total compensation for the tax year is required to be reported to stockholders because he or she is among the three highest compensated officers for the tax year, other than the chief executive officer or chief financial officer, and (ii) any person who was a covered employee at any time after December 31, 2016.\nPrior to January 1, 2018, certain grants may have qualified as \"performance-based compensation\" and, as such, would be exempt from the $1.0 million limitation on deductible compensation. The TCJA eliminated the performance-based compensation exception with respect to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. However, the TCJA provides a transition rule with respect to remuneration which is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not materially modified after that date. These, and other provisions of the TCJA, may have a material and adverse impact on the Company's business and financial condition and the value of the Company's common shares. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the TCJA. Holders should consult their tax advisors about the TCJA and its potential impact on their ownership of its common stock.\nWe may be unable to deduct interest payments on debt that is attributed to policies that we own and other operating losses, which would reduce any future income and cash flows.\nGenerally, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), interest paid or accrued on debt obligations is deductible in computing a taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax liability. However, when the proceeds of indebtedness are used to pay premiums on life insurance policies that are owned by the entity incurring the debt or otherwise used to support the purchase or ownership of life insurance policies, the interest in respect of such proceeds may not be deductible. Accordingly, so long as we use a portion of debt financing to pay the premiums on policies owned by us or to support the continued ownership of life insurance policies by us, the interest paid or accrued on that portion of the debt may not be currently deductible by us for federal income tax purposes. We may have net operating losses that we may be able to use to reduce a portion of our future taxable income, but the inability to currently deduct interest accrued on debt could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings and cash flows available for the payment of interest.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or net operating losses, to offset future taxable income. Recent changes in our stock ownership triggered, an ownership change, and as a result our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset income has been substantially limited.\nWe may not have the cash necessary to repurchase the 5.0% Convertible Notes and the 8.50% Senior Secured Notes.\nWe have issued $75.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Convertible Notes (the \"New Convertible Notes\") and $47.6 million in 8.5% Senior Secured Notes. The New Convertible Note Indenture provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the New Convertible Note Indenture; defaults or failure to pay certain other indebtedness; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the New Convertible Note Indenture, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the New Convertible Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid principal plus accrued interest on the New Convertible Notes immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions set forth in the New Convertible Note Indenture. In addition, holders of the New Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase the New Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain designated events at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount of the New Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe 8.5% Senior Secured Notes must be redeemed in full upon additional issuances of debt by the Company in each case, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus (i) accrued and unpaid interest on the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes redeemed up to the date of redemption, and (ii) the Applicable Premium, if any, as defined in the Amended and Restated\nSenior Secured Indenture. Upon a change of control, the Company will be required to make an offer to holders of the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes to repurchase the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 107.5% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of redemption.\nThe Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, plus a premium, if any, on all the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash to make a required repurchase of the New Convertible Notes or the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes at the applicable time, and may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on favorable terms. In addition, our ability to repurchase the New Convertible Notes or the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes may be limited by law or by the agreements governing our other indebtedness that exist at the time of the repurchase, as the case may be. Our failure to repurchase the New Convertible Notes or the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes when required by their indenture would constitute a default, which could also lead to a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and to repurchase the New Convertible Notes or the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInterest on the New Convertible Notes and on the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually and quarterly, respectively.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have been experiencing net losses and expect that net losses could continue for an uncertain period. If we continue to operate at a loss, our business may not be financially viable.\nAs of November 30, 2019, our net income from continuing operations was $16.9 million with an accumulated deficit of $291.5 million. As of November 30, 2019, our cash balance was $24.3 million and certificates of deposit were $511,000. We had net working capital of $22.8 million, outstanding debt of $123.4 million, we had equity investment of $137.8 million and life settlement assets of $1.3 million. If we do not succeed in our business plan\u2019s objectives to achieve profitability, our business might continue to experience losses and may not be sustainable in the future.\nOur success in operating our life finance business is dependent on making accurate assumptions about life expectancies and maintaining adequate cash balances to pay premiums.\nWe are responsible for paying all premiums necessary to keep the two policies in our portfolio in force and prevent them from lapsing. On December 4, 2019, subsequent to the year end, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release with Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and Wilmington Trust, N.A. as securities intermediary pursuant to which, thirty life insurance policies (included the two policies mentioned earlier) issued by Sun Life and held by the Company, primarily by White Eagle Asset Portfolio, L.P. (\"White Eagle\"), were canceled in exchange for a lump sum payment from Sun Life $36.1 million. As such, there are no further premium payments for the two life insurance policies subsequent to November 30, 2019.\nAs of November 30, 2019, we had approximately $24.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $511,000.\nWe do not control our significant asset and rely on third parties to manage it.\nAs a result of the transaction we consummated on August 16, 2019, pursuant to which we sold newly-issued limited partnership interests in White Eagle, constituting 72.5% of White Eagle\u2019s outstanding equity, to Palomino, we no longer control many of the operations and decisions of White Eagle relating to management of its life settlement portfolio, although the distributions from our remaining 27.5% investment in White Eagle constitute substantially all of our revenue. Specifically, we do not control decisions relating to optimizing the portfolio, including whether to sell policies, buy new policies, and lapse policies, and although we contribute to the payment of premiums which is funded by Palomino and repaid by us from funds to\nbe distributed to the Company through the waterfall, we do not control the timing or any decisions for the premium payments. In spite of the change in ownership, the distributions from that portfolio still constitute substantially all of our revenue. Accordingly, we rely on third parties, including Palomino, Palomino JV GP Limited, the general partner of White Eagle, and the manager of the portfolio as selected by such general partner, to manage the portfolio. There can be no assurance that such third parties will manage the portfolio in a successful manner or in the manner that we would do so. If such third parties do not manage the portfolio successfully, there could be adverse effects on our financial results, liquidity and performance.\nOur fair value assumptions are inherently subjective and, if the fair value of our equity investment in limited partnership decreases, we will report losses with respect to this investment.\nThe evaluation of the fair value of our equity investment in limited partnership is inherently subjective as it requires estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Using our valuation model, we determine the fair value of our equity investment on a discounted cash flow basis. The most significant assumptions that we estimate are the life expectancy of the insured, expected premium payments, the discount rate, repayment of the Class A and Class B investments. The discount rate is based upon current information about market interest rates, our estimate of the risk margin an investor in a similar transaction would require.\nIf the calculation of fair value results in a decrease in value, we record this reduction as a loss. If we determine that it is appropriate to increase the discount rate or adjust other inputs to our fair value model, if we are otherwise unable to accurately estimate the assumptions in our valuation model, the carrying value of our equity investment may be materially adversely affected and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in payment and non-payment of life insurance policy proceeds to the limited partnership can occur for many reasons and any such delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of arguments may be made by former beneficiaries (including but not limited to spouses, ex-spouses and descendants of the insured) under a life insurance policy, by the beneficiaries of the trust that once held the policy, by the estate or legal heirs of the insured or by the insurance company issuing such policy, to deny or delay payment of proceeds following the death of an insured, including arguments related to lack of mental capacity of the insured, usury, contestability or suicide provisions in a policy. The statements in the Non-Prosecution Agreement may make such delays more likely and may increase challenges by carriers to paying out death claims or challenges by families of insureds to policy proceeds. Furthermore, if the death of an insured cannot be verified and no death certificate can be produced, the related insurance company may not pay the proceeds of the life insurance policy until the passage of a statutory period (usually five to seven years) for the presumption of death without proof. Such delays in payment or non-payment of policy proceeds to the limited partnership may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of other finance companies and investors and may encounter additional competition.\nThere are a number of finance companies and investors that compete with us in the life finance industry. Many are significantly larger and possess considerably greater financial, marketing, management and other resources than we do. The life finance business could also prove attractive to new entrants. As a consequence, competition in this sector may increase. Increased competition could result in increased acquisition costs, changes to discount rates, margin compression and/or less favorable financing terms, each of which could materially adversely affect our income, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a regulator or court decides that trusts that were formed to own the life insurance policies that once served as collateral for our premium finance loans do not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our investment in the limited partnership which will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGenerally, there are two forms of insurable interests in the life of an individual, familial and financial. Additionally, an individual is deemed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life. It is also a common practice for an individual, as a grantor or settlor, to form an irrevocable trust to purchase and own a life insurance policy insuring the life of the grantor or settlor, where the beneficiaries of the trust are persons who themselves, by virtue of certain familial relationships with the grantor or settlor, also have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. In the event of a payment default on our premium finance loan, we previously acquired life insurance policies owned by trusts (or the beneficial interests in the trust itself) that we believe had an insurable interest in the life of the related insureds. However, a state insurance regulatory authority or a court may determine that the trust or policy owner did not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured or that we, as then lender, only had a limited insurable interest. Any such determination could result in the limited partnership being unable to\nreceive the proceeds of the life insurance policy, which could lead to a total loss on the investment in life settlements. Any such loss or losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur limited partnership is dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies comprising its portfolio. If a life insurance company defaults on its obligation to pay death benefits on a policy own, it would experience a loss of its investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our returns on investment, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur limited partnership is dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies that it owns. The limited partnership assume the credit risk associated with life insurance policies issued by various life insurance companies. The failure or bankruptcy of any such life insurance or annuity company could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operation. A life insurance company\u2019s business tends to track general economic and market conditions that are beyond its control, including extended economic recessions or interest rate changes. Changes in investor perceptions regarding the strength of insurers generally and the policies or annuities they offer can adversely affect our ability to sell or finance our assets. Adverse economic factors and volatility in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on a life insurance company\u2019s business and credit rating, financial condition and operating results, and an issuing life insurance company may default on its obligation to pay death benefits on the life insurance policies that we own. In such event, the limited partnership would experience a loss of its investment in such life insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our investment in the limited partnership and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires us to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have consumed and will continue to consume management resources and incur expenses for SOX compliance on an ongoing basis. In addition, as we have reduced the number of our employees and moved certain of our operations to foreign subsidiaries, we have increased our reliance on third parties for various aspects of our internal controls. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes governing life settlements could have a material adverse effect on our activities and income.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes could result in the enforcement of stricter compliance measures or adoption of additional measures on us or on the insurance companies that stand behind the insurance policies that we own, which could have a material adverse impact on our business activities and income. The SEC issued a task force report in July 2010 recommending that sales of life insurance policies in life settlement transactions be regulated as securities for purposes of the federal securities laws. To date, the SEC has not made such a recommendation to Congress. However, if the statutory definitions of \"security\" were amended to encompass life settlements, we could become subject to additional extensive regulatory requirements under the federal securities laws, including the obligation to register sales and offerings of life settlements with the SEC as public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 and, potentially, the obligation to register as an \"investment company\" pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any legislation implementing such regulatory change or a change in the transactions that are characterized as life settlement transactions could lead to significantly increased compliance costs, increased liability risk and adversely affect our ability to acquire or sell life insurance policies in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the current Presidential administration and U.S. Congress, we expect that there may be many changes to existing U.S. laws, regulations, and standards that may affect our business. Because of the uncertainty regarding existing law, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such change on our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation.\nOur former structured settlements business may expose us to future claims or contingent liabilities.\nPursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of our structured settlements business, we sold substantially all of that business\u2019 operating assets in 2013 while retaining substantially all of its\nliabilities. In addition, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain breaches of representations and warranties regarding us and various aspects of that business. Many of our indemnification obligations are subject to time and maximum liability limitations, however, in some instances our indemnification obligations are not subject to any limitations. Significant indemnification claims by the purchaser or other claims or contingent liability related to our former structured settlement business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to insureds and counterparties. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, counterparty, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, penalties, litigation or regulatory action.\nDisasters, disruptions and other impairment of our information technologies and systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur businesses depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including third party hosted services and data facilities that we do not control. While we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and backup systems, these plans and systems are not fully redundant. A system disruption caused by a natural disaster, cybercrime or other impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and may cause delays, loss of critical data and reputational harm, and could otherwise prevent us from servicing our portfolio of life insurance policies.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our executive officers\u2019 employment agreements could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. These agreements provide for substantial payments upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including a material diminution of base salaries or responsibilities. These payments may deter any transaction that would result in a change in control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nThese provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future. Furthermore, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by our board of directors, provided that the board shall consist of at least three and no more than fifteen members.\nThe market price of our stock has been highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate substantially in the future. This volatility may subject our stock price to material fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section, and other factors including market reaction to the estimated fair value of our portfolio; our capital structure; cash position; our ability to service our debt; rumors or dissemination of false information; changes in coverage or earnings estimates by analysts; our ability to meet analysts\u2019 or market expectations; and sales of common stock by existing shareholders. A decline in the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital by issuing additional securities.\nThe conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will be adjusted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change.\nThe provisions of the New Convertible Note Indenture include a make-whole provision to compensate the holders of such notes for the lost option time value and forgone interest payments upon the Company experiencing a Fundamental Change (as defined in the New Convertible Note Indenture). These Fundamental Changes revolve around change in beneficial ownership, the consummation of specified transactions which result in the conversion of common stock into other assets or the sale,\ntransfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, a majority change in the composition of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, the Company\u2019s stockholders' approval of any plan for liquidation of dissolution of the Company, and the Common Stock ceasing to be listed or quoted on a Trading Market (as defined under the New Convertible Notes). The number of incremental additional shares to be issued as a result of a Fundamental Change is based on a table which calculates the adjustment based on the inputs of time and share value. Such increase in the conversion rate will dilute the ownership interest of our common stock shareholders.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Board Rights agreements entered into as part of our 2017 recapitalization, could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In particular, shareholders are required to provide us with advance notice of shareholder nominations and proposals to be brought before any annual meeting of shareholders, which could discourage or deter a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to introduce a proposal. In addition, our articles of incorporation eliminate our shareholders\u2019 ability to act without a meeting and require the holders of not less than 50% of the voting power of our common stock to call a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, our bylaws require that in order to be eligible to nominate or propose for nomination a candidate for election as a director, a shareholder must own at least one percent of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock for no less than twelve months.\nCertain laws of the State of Florida could impede a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nAs a Florida corporation, we are subject to the Florida Business Corporation Act, which provides that a person who acquires shares in an \"issuing public corporation,\" as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person. The Florida Business Corporation Act also contains a statute which provides that an affiliated transaction with an interested shareholder generally must be approved by (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our voting shares, other than the shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder, or (ii) a majority of the disinterested directors.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is licensed as a viatical settlement provider and is regulated by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. As a Florida viatical settlement provider, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC is subject to regulation as a specialty insurer under certain provisions of the Florida Insurance Code. Under applicable Florida law, no person can finally acquire, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of a viatical settlement provider or its controlling company without the written approval of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Accordingly, any person who acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities will be required by law to notify the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation no later than five days after any form of tender offer or exchange offer is proposed, or no later than five days after the acquisition of securities or ownership interest if no tender offer or exchange offer is involved. Such person will also be required to file with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation an application for approval of the acquisition no later than 30 days after the same date that triggers the 5-day notice requirement.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may disapprove the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting securities by any person who refuses to apply for and obtain regulatory approval of such acquisition. In addition, if the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation determines that any person has acquired 10% or more of our voting securities without obtaining its regulatory approval, it may order that person to cease the acquisition and divest itself of any shares of our voting securities that may have been acquired in violation of the applicable Florida law. Due to the requirement to file an application with and obtain approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, purchasers of 10% or more of our voting securities may incur additional expenses in connection with preparing, filing and obtaining approval of the application, and the effectiveness of the acquisition will be delayed pending receipt of approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may also take disciplinary action against Imperial Life Settlements, LLC\u2019s license if it finds that an acquisition of our voting securities is made in violation of the applicable Florida law and would render the further transaction of business hazardous to our counterparties, creditors, shareholders or the public.\nDue to delisting our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), you may find it difficult to dispose of your shares and our share price may be adversely affected.\nOn January 23, 2017, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from the NYSE, and on February 3, 2017, the trading of our common stock began on the over-the-counter market, OTCQB. On May 29, 2018, trading of our common stock moved to the OTCQX market. Such trading could reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, investors may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be severely limited.\nTrading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \"penny stock\" (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low-priced stocks to their clients. Moreover, various regulations and policies restrict the ability of stockholders to borrow against or \"margin\" low-priced stocks, and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls. Additionally, because brokers\u2019 commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks, the current price of the common stock can result in an individual stockholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher. This factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock. Finally, the additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock, thereby negatively impacting the share price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12557, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "EMGC"}
