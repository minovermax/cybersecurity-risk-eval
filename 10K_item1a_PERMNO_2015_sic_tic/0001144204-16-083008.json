{"cik": "880285", "company": "ENBRIDGE ENERGY PARTNERS LP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors We encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast, and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase cash distributions. Our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development, construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets. The construction of new assets involves numerous regulatory, environmental, legal, political, permitting at federal, state and local levels, as well as materials and labor cost and operational risks that are difficult to predict and beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected. If we experience material cost overruns, we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods:\n\u2022 using cash from operations;\n\u2022 delaying other planned projects;\n\u2022 incurring additional indebtedness; or\n\u2022 issuing additional equity.\nAny or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project. For example, if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility, the design, construction, development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems. In addition, circumstances may occur from time to time, such as the inability to obtain a necessary permit, which could cause us to cancel a project. If our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays, project cancellations or other factors, we may not meet our obligations as they become due, and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget, sell non-strategic assets, access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements.\nOur ability to access capital markets and credit on attractive terms to obtain funding for our capital projects and acquisitions may be limited. Our ability to fund our capital projects and make acquisitions depends on whether we can access the necessary financing to fund these activities. Domestic and international economic conditions affect the functioning of capital markets and the availability of credit. Adverse economic conditions, such as those prevalent during the recessionary period of 2008 that continued for several years as well as the current decline in commodity prices, periodically result in weakness and volatility in the capital markets, which in turn can limit, temporarily or for extended periods, our ability to raise capital through equity or debt offerings. Additionally, the availability and cost of obtaining credit commitments from lenders can change as economic conditions and banking regulations reduce the credit that lenders have available or are willing to lend. These conditions, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector and the re-pricing of market risks, can make it difficult to obtain funding for our capital needs from the capital markets on acceptable economic terms. As a result, we may revise the timing and scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to prevailing market and economic conditions.\nDue to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from bank credit arrangements or capital markets on acceptable terms, if needed and to the extent required. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions and construction projects, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could require us to provide collateral for our hedging liabilities and negatively impact our interest costs and borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities. Standard & Poor\u2019s, or S&P, Dominion Bond Rating System, or DBRS, and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, or Moody\u2019s, rate our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured debt. Although we are not aware of current plans by the ratings agencies to lower their respective ratings on such debt, we cannot be assured that such credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nCurrently, we are parties to certain International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., or ISDA\u00ae, agreements associated with the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. These ISDA\u00ae agreements require us to provide assurances of performance if our counterparties\u2019 exposure to us exceeds certain levels or thresholds. We generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such requirements. At December 31, 2015, we have provided $120.1 million in the form of letters of credit as assurances of performance for our then outstanding derivative financial instruments. In the event that our credit ratings were to decline to the lowest level of investment grade, as determined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, we would be required to provide letters of credit in substantially greater amounts to satisfy the requirements of our ISDA\u00ae agreements. For example, if our credit ratings had been at the lowest level of investment grade at December 31, 2015, we would have been required to provide additional letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $52.5 million. The amounts of any letters of credit we would have to establish under the terms of our ISDA\u00ae agreements would reduce the amount that we are able to borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 364-day credit facility, referred to as our Credit Facilities.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows to enable us to continue to pay distributions at the current level. We may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to pay distributions at the current level. The amount of cash we are able to distribute depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which can fluctuate quarterly based upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the operating performances of our assets;\n\u2022 commodity prices;\n\u2022 our ability to bring new assets into service at its expected time and projected cost;\n\u2022 actions of governmental regulatory bodies;\n\u2022 the level of capital expenditures we make;\n\u2022 the amount of cash reserves established by Enbridge Management;\n\u2022 our ability to access capital markets and borrow money;\n\u2022 our debt service requirements and restrictions in our credit agreements;\n\u2022 the ability of MEP to make distributions to us;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our working capital needs; and\n\u2022 the cost of acquisitions.\nIn addition, the amount of cash we distribute depends primarily on our cash flow rather than net income or net loss. Therefore, we may make cash distributions for periods in which we record net losses or may make no distributions for periods in which we record net income.\nOur acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results, are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses. The acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy. Acquisitions present various risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022 the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations;\n\u2022 a decrease in liquidity as a result of utilizing significant amounts of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition;\n\u2022 the loss of critical customers or employees at the acquired business;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not fully and adequately indemnified;\n\u2022 the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration; and\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations.\nIn addition, we may be unable to identify acquisition targets or consummate acquisitions in the future.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less. Our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our liquids or natural gas pipeline systems. Decreases in the volumes transported by our systems can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The volume transported on our pipelines can be influenced by factors beyond our control including:\n\u2022 competition;\n\u2022 regulatory action;\n\u2022 weather conditions;\n\u2022 storage levels;\n\u2022 alternative energy sources;\n\u2022 decreased demand;\n\u2022 fluctuations in energy commodity prices;\n\u2022 environmental or other governmental regulations;\n\u2022 economic conditions;\n\u2022 supply disruptions;\n\u2022 availability of supply connected to our pipeline systems; and\n\u2022 availability and adequacy of infrastructure to move, treat and process supply into and out of our systems.\nAs an example, the volume of shipments on our Lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western Canadian crude oil. Insufficient supplies of western Canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our Lakehead system. Decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western Canada and other factors, including supply disruption, higher development costs and competition, can slow the rate of growth of our Lakehead system. The volume of crude oil that we transport on our Lakehead system, as well as the North Dakota and Bakken systems, also depends on the demand for crude oil in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States and the volumes of crude oil and refined products delivered by others into these regions and the province of Ontario. As well, there are supply driven risks around our North Dakota and Bakken assets, as lower commodity prices can reduce drilling and volumes on our systems.\nIn addition, our ability to increase deliveries to expand our Lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western Canadian crude oil. We expect that growth in future supplies of western Canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in Alberta. Full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our Alberta Clipper and Southern Access pipelines and future expansions of our Lakehead system will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects. A reduction in demand for crude oil or a decline in crude oil prices may make certain oil sands projects uneconomical since development costs for production of crude oil from oil sands is greater than development costs for production of conventional crude oil. Oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities, as some oil sands producers have done in recent years, if crude oil prices are at levels that do not support expansion. Any cancellation or delay of oil sands projects could directly impact our Lakehead system with potential indirect impacts on our Mid-Continent, North Dakota and Bakken systems. Additionally, measures adopted by the government of the province of Alberta to increase its share of revenues from oil sands development coupled with a decline in crude oil prices could reduce the volume growth we have anticipated in expanding the capacity of our crude oil pipelines.\nThe volume of shipments on natural gas and NGL systems depends on the supply of natural gas and NGLs available for shipment from the producing regions that supply these systems. Supply available for shipment can be affected by many factors, including commodity prices, weather and drilling activity among other factors listed above. Volumes shipped on these systems are also affected by the demand for natural gas and NGLs in the markets these systems serve. Existing customers may not extend their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a decline in the availability of natural gas from our Mid-Continent, United States Gulf Coast and East Texas producing regions, or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems were to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical. We may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by risks associated with the Alberta oil sands. Our Lakehead system is highly dependent on sustained production from the Alberta oil sands. Growth in production from the oil sands over the past decade has remained strong due to high oil prices and improved production methods; however the industry faces a number of risks associated with the scope and scale of its projects. Factors and risks affecting the oil sands industry include:\n\u2022 reduced crude oil prices;\n\u2022 cost inflation;\n\u2022 labor availability;\n\u2022 environmental impact;\n\u2022 reputation management;\n\u2022 changing policy and regulation; and\n\u2022 commodity price volatility.\nAlberta oil sands producers face a number of challenges that must be managed effectively to allow for sustained growth in the sector. The unprecedented level of development in the Alberta oil sands has driven costs upward as a result of a tight labor market, high equipment costs, and costs for commodities such as steel and other raw materials. Labor has been one of the most important considerations for the industry, as worker wages have risen steadily with industry development over the past several years.\nThe environmental impact of oil sands development in northern Alberta has been at the forefront of discussion around future industry growth in the region. Labor and environmental groups have expressed their views and concerns about oil sands development and pipeline infrastructure in the public domain and in front of regulators. The primary concerns raised include greenhouse gas emissions and environmental monitoring and reclamation. Though industry associations have stated that they are not opposed to changes in policy and regulation to address these concerns, the adoption of new regulation that may curtail oil sands development or adversely impact the oil and gas industry remains a risk and may result in, among other things, significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or decreased demand for our products.\nCompetition may reduce our revenues. Our Lakehead system faces current and potentially further competition from other pipelines for transporting western Canadian crude oil, which may reduce our volumes and the associated revenues. To the extent that the rate is calculated using a cost-of-service methodology, these lower volumes will increase our transportation rates. The increase in transportation rates could result in rates that are higher than competitive conditions will otherwise permit. Our Lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, Buffalo, and Sarnia, and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the Patoka/Wood River area of southern Illinois. Refineries in the markets served by our Lakehead system compete with refineries in western Canada, the province of Ontario and the Rocky Mountain region of the United States for supplies of western Canadian crude oil.\nOur Ozark pipeline system faces competition from a competitor pipeline that carries crude oil from Hardisty to Wood River and Patoka in southern Illinois.\nOur North Dakota system faces competition from rail transportation driven by limited transportation infrastructure to key markets. Further, recently announced pipeline projects by competitors are supported by contracts and take-or-pay arrangements, which increases the competitive pressure on our North Dakota system.\nWe also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering, treating, and processing and transmission businesses. A number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce the revenue we derive from the intrastate transmission of natural gas. Many of the large wholesale customers served by our natural gas systems have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities. Thus, many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines. Most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them. In addition, they have other alternatives, such as building their own gathering facilities or, in some cases, selling their natural gas supplies without processing. Some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us, which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do.\nOur gas marketing operations involve market and regulatory risks. As part of our natural gas, NGL and condensate marketing activities, we purchase natural gas, NGLs and condensate at prices determined by prevailing market conditions. Following our purchase of natural gas, NGLs and condensate, we generally resell the natural gas, NGLs, or condensate under sales contracts that are generally comparable in terms to our purchase contracts, including any price escalation provisions. The profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors:\n\u2022 our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets;\n\u2022 reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long-term purchase contracts;\n\u2022 consumers\u2019 willingness to use other fuels when natural gas, NGL or condensate prices increase significantly;\n\u2022 timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results;\n\u2022 the ability of our customers to make timely payment;\n\u2022 inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas, NGLs or condensate on comparable terms;\n\u2022 changes in, limitations upon or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate in interstate commerce; and\n\u2022 long-term commitments on third-party pipelines, storage facilities or fractionation agreements that are above market prices and may go unutilized.\nOur Liquids segment results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility. Volatility in commodity prices can impact production volumes in the oil sands region of Western Canada and the Bakken region of North Dakota, our two primary crude oil supply basins.\nThe relatively high costs and large up front capital investments required by oil sands projects involves significant assumptions concerning short-term and long-term crude oil fundamentals including world supply and demand, North American supply and demand, and price outlook among many other factors. As oil sands production is long-term in nature, the long-term outlook is significant to a producer\u2019s investment decision. These decisions may impact the annual rate of future supply growth from the oil sands region.\nWhile current oil sands projects are not as sensitive to short-term declines in crude oil prices, a protracted decline in crude oil prices could result in delay or cancellation of future projects. In addition, wide commodity price spreads have impacted producer netbacks and margins in the past years that largely resulted from insufficient pipeline infrastructure and takeaway capacity from producing regions in Alberta. Combined with high labor and operating costs, this has forced some producers to reconsider or defer projects until a more favorable climate for infrastructure development can be forecast.\nTight sands and shale oil production in any basin in North America such as the Bakken or the Permian will be comparatively more sensitive to the short-term changes in crude oil prices due to the sharp declining production profile associated with individual tight sands and shale oil wells. Accordingly, during periods of comparatively low prices, supply growth from the North Dakota basin may be lower, which may impact volumes on our pipeline system.\nOur Natural Gas segment results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities. Our industry remains in a weak commodity price cycle, which could extend beyond 2016. Our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to our natural gas processing activities. Before hedging, approximately 40% of our gross margin attributable to our natural gas processing activities is expected to be attributable to contracts with some degree of commodity price exposure in 2016. MEP employs a disciplined hedging program to manage this direct commodity price risk.\nTo the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure in 2016, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges. However, because we are not fully hedged, we will continue to have commodity price exposure on the unhedged portion of the commodities we receive in-kind as payment for our gathering, processing, treating and transportation services. As a result of this unhedged exposure, a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our results of operation and cash flows and ability to make distributions.\nAdditionally, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows. Our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended. Further, hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts, particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions. In addition, certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. This causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices.\nChanges in, or challenges to, our rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The rates charged by several of our pipeline systems are regulated by the FERC or state regulatory agencies, or both. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower our tariff rates, the profitability of our pipeline businesses would suffer. If we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which if delayed could further reduce our cash flow. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for our services.\nWe believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines are just and reasonable under the ICA and NGA, respectively. However, because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint, or a regulator\u2019s own initiative, we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines. Furthermore, because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters, the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations.\nIncreased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may reduce our revenues. Our interstate pipelines and certain activities of our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to FERC regulation of terms and conditions of service. In the case of interstate natural gas pipelines, FERC also establishes requirements respecting the construction and abandonment of pipeline facilities. FERC has pending proposals to increase posting and other compliance requirements applicable to natural gas markets. Such changes could prompt an increase in FERC regulatory oversight of our pipelines and additional legislation that could increase our FERC regulatory compliance costs and decrease the net income generated by our pipeline systems.\nOur risk management policies cannot eliminate all risks. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management policies could result in significant financial losses. We use derivative financial instruments to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices, as well as to reduce volatility to our cash flows. Based on our risk management policies, all of our derivative financial instruments are associated with an underlying asset, liability and/or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates. These policies cannot, however, eliminate all risk of unauthorized trading and other speculative activity. Although this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function, we remain exposed to the risk of non-compliance with our risk management policies. We can provide no assurance that our risk management function will detect and prevent all unauthorized trading and other violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception, collusion or other intentional misconduct is involved, and any such violations could result in significant financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nCompliance with environmental and operational safety laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. Our pipeline, gathering, processing and trucking operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety. Numerous governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations they administer and permits they issue, oftentimes imposing complex requirements and necessitating capital expenditures or increased operating costs to achieve compliance, especially when activity is in the presence of sensitive elements like water crossings, wetlands and endangered species. Our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and operating permits can result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. Our operation of liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering, processing, treating and transportation facilities exposes us to the risk of incurring significant environmental and safety-related costs and liabilities. Additionally, operational modifications, including pipeline restrictions, necessary to comply with regulatory requirements and resulting from our handling of liquid petroleum and natural gas, historical environmental contamination, accidental releases or upsets, regulatory enforcement, litigation or safety and health incidents can also result in significant cost or limit revenues and volumes. Further, environmental and operational safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to pipeline safety, wastewater discharge and air emission requirements, continue to become more stringent over time, particularly those related to the oil and gas industry. We may incur joint and several strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of liquid petroleum and natural gas and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities, many of which have been used for gathering or processing activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under our control. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our gathering systems pass and facilities where our liquid petroleum and natural gas or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations, or re-interpretations of enforcement policies or claims for personal, property or environmental damage. We may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher rates.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives. Because our operations, including our processing, treating and fractionation facilities and our compressor stations, emit various types of greenhouse gases, legislation and regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities, and could delay future permitting. In addition, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in less demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs over time. At the federal level, the United States Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to impose a tax on carbon or require a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a rule requiring nation-wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions beginning January 1, 2010. The rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas, as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines. Subsequently, on November 30, 2010, the EPA issued a\nsupplemental rulemaking that expanded the types of industrial sources that are subject to or potentially subject to the EPA\u2019s mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements to include petroleum and natural gas systems. These regulations were amended by the EPA in November 2014.\nThe EPA concluded that the April 2010 issuance of regulations to control the greenhouse gas emissions from light duty motor vehicles (the \u201ctailpipe rule\u201d) automatically triggered provisions of the CAA that, in general, potentially could require stationary source facilities that emit more than 250 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent to obtain permits to demonstrate that best practices and technology are being used to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. On May 13, 2010, the EPA issued the \u201ctailoring rule,\u201d which served to establish the greenhouse gas emissions threshold for major new (and major modifications to existing) stationary sources. This rule was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA), which dismissed the challenge on jurisdictional grounds. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 (Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA) found the rule to be unlawful. Under the approach now being implemented by the EPA, for most purposes, new permitting provisions to control greenhouse gas emissions are required for new major source facilities that also emit 100,000 tons per year or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e, and existing major source facilities making major modifications that also would increase greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 CO2e. The EPA has also indicated in rulemakings that it may further reduce the current regulatory thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions, making additional sources subject to permitting. In August 2015, the EPA proposed regulations to reduce methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The proposed rule would impose additional costs related to compliance with the new emission limits as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations.\nIn addition, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Although many of the state-level initiatives have, to date, focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that in the future sources in states where we operate, such as our gas-fired compressors, could become subject to greenhouse gas-related state regulations. Depending on the particular program, we could in the future be required to take direct measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions or purchase and surrender emission allowances. Any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with new legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows, in addition to the demand for our services.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues. A significant portion of our customers\u2019 natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in Congress. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having commenced a multi-year study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources; the multi-year study\u2019s individual research projects began publishing results in 2013, and individual studies are ongoing. In addition, the EPA has announced its intention to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production activities under the CWA and in a proposed rule published on April 7, 2015. The EPA anticipates finalizing this rule by August 2016. The Department of Interior also issued new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on public and tribal lands that may impose additional operating costs. The impact of this rule is uncertain because it is subject to ongoing litigation and is currently enjoined pursuant to a court order.\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA also approved final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. These new rules address emissions of various pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities by, among other things, requiring new or reworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells to control emissions through flaring until 2015, after which reduced emission or \u201cgreen\u201d completions must be used. The rules also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas producing plants, and\ncertain other equipment. On April 12, 2013, the EPA proposed amendments to the rule which would, among other things, provide additional time for recently constructed, modified or reconstructed storage tanks to install emission controls.\nFuture regulatory actions also have the potential to impact our operations. In August 2015, the EPA issued proposed options that would clarify the definition of \u201cadjacent\u201d sources of pollution in the context of the Clean Air Act permitting requirements for the oil and gas sector. This action could result in additional permitting burdens under the EPA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, Nonattainment New Source Review, and Title V permitting programs. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration also has announced its intention to propose rules in 2016 that could, when finalized, require us to, among other things, upgrade our automatic shut-off valves at our facilities. Finally, in October 2015, the EPA proposed to reduce the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone from 75 Ppb to 70 Ppb. Once final, this regulation could impose additional emissions control costs on our operations.\nThese rules and proposals may require a number of modifications to our customers\u2019 and our own operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in additional costs for us and our customers, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nSeveral states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. For example, on December 13, 2011, the TRRC adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure Rule implementing a state law passed in June 2011, requiring public disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluid contents for wells drilled under drilling permits issued after February 1, 2012. Certain states, including the State of Texas, also have taken regulatory action in response to increased seismic activity that in certain cases has been connected to hydraulic fracturing or to saltwater or drilling fluid disposal wells. In addition, at least one municipality in a state in which we operate, the City of Denton, Texas, has followed others in adopting bans or severely restricting hydraulic fracturing activities. Litigation concerning this ban, as well as others, is ongoing. We cannot predict whether any legislation or regulation will be enacted and if so, what its provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits are required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level, it could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines. These factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to move through our gathering and other systems, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nPipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Operation of complex pipeline systems, gathering, treating, processing and trucking operations involves many risks, hazards and uncertainties. These events include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. These types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, any of which could also result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear a part or all of the cost. Costs of pipeline seepage over time may be mitigated through insurance, however, if not discovered within the specified insurance time period we would incur full costs for the incident. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with such events. For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential communities, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering locations, the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater.\nUnited States based oil sands development opponents as well as others concerned with environmental impacts of pipeline routes advocated by our competitors have utilized political pressure to influence the timing and whether such permits are granted which could impact future pipeline development.\nOur assets vary in age and were constructed over many decades which may cause our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase in the future. In addition, there could be service interruptions due to unknown events or conditions, or increased downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our pipelines vary in age and were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have changed over time. Depending on the era of construction, some assets will require more frequent inspections, which could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. As well, there could be service interruptions due to unknown events or conditions, or increased downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nMeasurement adjustments on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation, commodity prices and other factors. Oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines. The three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include:\n\u2022 physical, which results from evaporation, shrinkage, differences in measurement (including sediment and water measurement) between receipt and delivery locations and other operational conditions;\n\u2022 degradation resulting from mixing at the interface within our pipeline systems or terminals and storage facilities between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines; and\n\u2022 revaluation, which is a function of crude oil prices, the level of our carriers\u2019 inventory and the inventory positions of customers.\nQuantifying oil measurement adjustments is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical as products continuously move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground. In our case, measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the length of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we transport. Accordingly, we utilize engineering-based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses.\nNatural gas measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines. The quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments is complicated by several factors including: (1) the significant quantities (i.e., thousands) of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems, primarily around our gathering and processing assets; (2) varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems; and (3) variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies. Each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that can occur on our natural gas systems.\nWe do not own a majority of the land on which our pipelines are located, which could result in increased costs and disruptions to our operations. We do not own a majority of the land on which our pipelines are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid leases or rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies (including but not limited to Native American lands), and some of our agreements may grant us those rights for only a specific period of time. We are unable to predict the outcome of discussions with third parties, the governmental agencies, the appropriate Native American tribes, the tribes\u2019 governing bodies, or the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs with respect to future arrangements or changes in applicable laws and the resulting costs, fees, bonds and taxes related to these leases, easements and rights-of-way, or grants of land rights. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nTerrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war, and other civil unrest or activism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war, or other civil unrest or activism may have significant effects on general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. In addition, increased environmental activism against pipeline construction and operation could potentially result in work delays, reduced demand for our products and services, increased legislation or denial or delay of permits and rights-of-way. Finally, the disruption or a significant increase in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. A security breach of our network or systems could result in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers\u2019 products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products for which we could be held liable. Furthermore, we collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. We conduct cyber security audits from time to time and continuously monitor our systems in an effort to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks or security breaches; however, we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyber-attack on our assets. Despite our security measures, our information systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other breaches), which could compromise our network or systems and result in the release or loss of the information stored therein, misappropriation of assets, disruption to our operations or damage to our facilities. As a result of a cyber-attack or security breach, we could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, subject to regulatory penalties, experience damage to our reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in our products and services, or incur additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe adoption and implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements for swap transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities. In July 2010, federal legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act provides additional statutory requirements for swap transactions, including energy and interest rate hedging transactions. These statutory requirements must be implemented through regulations, primarily through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. To date, the Dodd-Frank Act provisions have not materially changed the way many of our swap transactions are entered into, as we have been able to continue transacting with existing counterparties in over-the-counter markets or with registered exchanges to meet hedging requirements set forth in our risk policies.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our hedging activities as an end user is uncertain at this time, as the CFTC continues to promulgate final regulations for position limits. Although the margin rules were recently finalized, the upcoming implementation of key provisions in the margin rules and the finalization of position limit provisions may create new regulatory burdens from these developments in addition to the various business conduct, recordkeeping and reporting rules resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act provisions currently in place. Moreover, longer term, fundamental changes to the swap market as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act requirements could significantly increase the cost of entering into and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps.\nDepending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities hedging transactions in circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures or other partnership purposes. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our willingness or ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. If we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.\nWe are exposed to credit risks of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations. Some of our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers\u2019 liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. Financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our assets, reduction of our operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which could reduce our revenues.\nWe are exposed to restrictions on the ability of Midcoast Operating to repay indebtedness owed to us and MEP and Midcoast Operating to make distributions to us. We, as financial support provider, entered into a financial support agreement with Midcoast Operating, pursuant to which we will provide letters of credit and guarantees, not to exceed $700 million in the aggregate at any time outstanding, in support of the financial obligations of Midcoast Operating and its wholly owned subsidiaries under derivative agreements and natural gas and NGL purchase agreements to which Midcoast Operating, or one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a party. Our rights to payments under the financial support agreement are subordinated to the rights of the lenders under the private placement debt of MEP and the revolving credit facility of MEP and Midcoast Operating during the continuation of a default under their revolving credit facility. If Midcoast Operating experiences financial or other problems and fails to comply with the covenants under their revolving credit facility, it would limit our ability to receive payment of amounts owed to us under this agreement. In addition, MEP and Midcoast Operating are restricted under their revolving credit facility from making distributions to us in certain circumstances involving certain defaults thereunder or any events of defaults thereunder. Any inability of MEP or Midcoast Operating to make distributions, or of Midcoast Operating to repay its indebtedness to us, could reduce our cash flows and affect our results of operations.\nRISKS ARISING FROM OUR PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR GENERAL PARTNER AND ENBRIDGE MANAGEMENT The interests of Enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our unitholders, and the board of directors of Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict, not just the interests of our unitholders, in making important business decisions. Enbridge indirectly owns all of the shares of our General Partner and all of the voting shares of Enbridge Management, and elects all of the directors of both companies. Furthermore, some of the directors and officers of our General Partner and Enbridge Management are also directors and officers of Enbridge. Consequently, conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and Enbridge.\nOur partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our General Partner to our unitholders. These restrictions allow our General Partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict, including Enbridge Management\u2019s interests, our interests and those of our General Partner. In addition, these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our General Partner or Enbridge Management, its delegate, should its directors or officers act in a way that, were it not for these limitations of liability, would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties.\nWe do not have any employees. In managing our business and affairs, we rely on employees of Enbridge, and its affiliates, who act on behalf of and as agents for us. A decrease in the availability of employees from Enbridge could adversely affect us.\nOur partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that Enbridge Management and our General Partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by Enbridge Management and our General Partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our General Partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law. Through the delegation of control agreement, these modified fiduciary duties also apply to Enbridge Management as the delegate of our General Partner. For example, our partnership agreement:\n\u2022 permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions, including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest, in its \u201csole discretion.\u201d This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any unitholder;\n\u2022 provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our General Partner will be modified, waived or limited as required to permit our General Partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement, so long as such action is reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in our best interests; and\n\u2022 provides that our General Partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith.\nThese and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by Enbridge Management or our General Partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. Because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our General Partner and Enbridge Management have been modified, the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or Enbridge Management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. Conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders, on the one hand, and Enbridge Management and its shareholders, on the other hand. In managing and controlling us as the delegate of our General Partner, Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or Enbridge Management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders. The following decisions, among others, could involve conflicts of interest:\n\u2022 whether we or Enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities;\n\u2022 whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units;\n\u2022 whether Enbridge Management or Enbridge Partners will issue additional shares or other equity securities;\n\u2022 the amount of payments to Enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit;\n\u2022 the amount of costs that are reimbursable to Enbridge Management or Enbridge and its affiliates by us;\n\u2022 the enforcement of obligations owed to us by Enbridge Management, our General Partner or Enbridge, including obligations regarding competition between Enbridge and us; and\n\u2022 the retention of separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us and Enbridge Management.\nIn these and similar situations, any decision by Enbridge Management may benefit one group more than another, and in making such decisions, Enbridge Management may consider the interests of all groups, as well as other factors, in deciding whether to take a particular course of action.\nIn other situations, Enbridge may take certain actions, including engaging in businesses that compete with us or are adverse to us and our unitholders. For example, although Enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses, that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions:\n\u2022 Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses, including the normal development of such businesses, in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in December 1991;\n\u2022 such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering;\n\u2022 Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition, so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired, in Enbridge\u2019s reasonable judgment, is not attributable to the competitive business; and\n\u2022 Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of Enbridge Management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition.\nSince we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering, Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business. In addition, Enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our Lakehead system, even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business.\nWe can issue additional common or other classes of units, including additional i-units to Enbridge Management when it issues additional shares, which would dilute the ownership interest of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us, including the issuance of additional i-units to Enbridge Management when it issues additional shares may have the following effects:\n\u2022 The amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022 The relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease; and\n\u2022 The market price of the Class A common units may decline.\nAdditionally, the public sale by our General Partner of a significant portion of the Class A or Class B common units, Class D units, Class E units or Series 1 preferred units that it or its subsidiary currently owns could reduce the market price of the Class A common units. Our partnership agreement allows the General Partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the General Partner or its affiliates. A public or private sale of the Class A or Class B common units, Class D units, Class E units or Series 1 preferred units currently held by our General Partner or its subsidiary could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding Class A common units.\nHolders of our limited partner interests have limited voting rights. Our unitholders have limited voting rights on matters affecting our business, which may have a negative effect on the price at which our common units trade. In particular, the unitholders did not elect our General Partner or the directors of our General Partner or Enbridge Management and have no rights to elect our General Partner or the directors of our General Partner or Enbridge Management on an annual or other continuing basis. Furthermore, if unitholders are not satisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they may find it difficult to remove our General Partner. Under the provisions of our partnership agreement, our General Partner may be removed upon the vote of at least 66.67% of the outstanding common units (excluding the units held by the General Partner and its affiliates) and a majority of the outstanding i-units voting together as a separate class (excluding the number of i-units corresponding to the number of shares of Enbridge Management held by our General Partner and its affiliates). Such removal must, however, provide for the election and succession of a new general partner, who may be required to purchase the departing general partner interest in us in order to become the successor general partner.\nSuch restrictions may limit the flexibility of the limited partners in removing our general partner, and removal may also result in the general partner interest in us held by the departing general partner being converted into Class A common units.\nThe NYSE does not require a publicly-traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements. Our Class A common units are listed on the NYSE. The NYSE does not require us to have, and we do not intend to have, a majority of independent directors on the boards of our General Partner or Enbridge Management, or to establish a compensation committee or nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, any future issuance of additional Class A common units or other securities, including to affiliates, will not be subject to the NYSE\u2019s shareholder approval rules that apply to corporations. Accordingly, holders of our Class A common units will not have the same protections afforded to investor owners of certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nWe are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries\u2019 distributions to service our debt obligations. We are a holding company with no material operations. If we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries, we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations. Our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions, which could further limit each operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us.\nThe debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by any of our subsidiaries that are guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities. Holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities. The claims to the assets of these non-guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries. Claims of our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries\u2019 creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt, including the debt securities. Our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries\u2019 creditors may include:\n\u2022 general creditors;\n\u2022 trade creditors;\n\u2022 secured creditors;\n\u2022 taxing authorities; and\n\u2022 creditors holding guarantees.\nEnbridge Management\u2019s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Enbridge Management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures, provide for the proper conduct of business, and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our common units.\nHolders of our Series 1 Preferred Units have a distribution preference, which may adversely affect the value the Class A common units. The holders of our Series 1 Preferred Units, or Preferred Units, have a preferential right to distributions prior to distributions to the holders of our Class A common units. Through the quarter ending June 30, 2018, the quarterly distributions will not be payable on the Preferred Units and instead will accrue and accumulate. The accrued amounts will be paid in equal amounts over a twelve-quarter period beginning with the first quarter of 2019. Thereafter, the distributions will be paid in cash on a quarterly basis. To the extent that we do not pay in full any distribution on the Preferred Units, the unpaid amount will accrue and accumulate until it is paid in full, and no distributions may be made on the common units during that time.\nRISKS ARISING FROM OUR PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE Total insurance coverage for multiple insurable incidents exceeding coverage limits would be allocated by our General Partner on an equitable basis. We are included in the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by Enbridge for its subsidiaries and affiliates through the policy renewal date of May 1, 2016. The comprehensive insurance program also includes property insurance coverage on our assets, except pipeline assets that are not located at major water crossings, including earnings interruption resulting from an insurable event. In the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among the Enbridge entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement the Partnership has entered into with Enbridge, MEP, and another Enbridge subsidiary.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS Agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common units, and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility. MEP is restricted by its credit facility from making distributions to us. MEP and Midcoast Operating are restricted by their revolving credit facility from declaring or making distributions to us if a revolving credit facility payment, insolvency or financial covenant default then exists or any other default then exists which permits the lenders to accelerate the revolving credit facility. However, if no such defaults exist when such distribution is declared, MEP and Midcoast are permitted to make distributions to us even if any such defaults exist when the distribution is made unless MEP or any of its subsidiaries has knowledge that the revolving credit facility has been accelerated.\nIn addition, we are prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders during (1) the existence of certain defaults under our Credit Facilities or (2) during a period in which we have elected to defer interest payments on the Junior Notes, subject to limited exceptions as set forth in the related indenture. Further, the agreements governing our Credit Facilities may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on:\n\u2022 incurring additional debt;\n\u2022 entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets; and\n\u2022 granting liens.\nAlthough the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt, they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, to incur liens to secure debt and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. A breach of any restriction under our Credit Facilities or our indentures could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and, in the case of our Credit Facilities, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions.\nUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our partners if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement. Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nTAX RISKS TO COMMON UNITHOLDERS Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, or if we were otherwise subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our distributable cash flow to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nDespite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a publicly-traded partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.\nSection 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Internal Revenue Code, provides that publicly-traded partnerships will, as a general rule, be taxed as corporations. An exception exists, however, with respect to a publicly-traded partnership for which 90% or more of the gross income for every taxable year consists of \u201cqualifying income.\u201d If less than 90% of our gross income for any taxable year is qualifying income, we will be taxed as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes for that taxable year and all subsequent tax years. Although we do not believe that we will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes based on our current operations, the IRS could disagree with the positions we take. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other tax matter affecting us.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our distributable cash flow would be substantially reduced.\nIn addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. For example, we are required to pay Texas franchise tax on our gross income apportioned to Texas.\nImposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash we have available for distribution. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjected to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, there would be a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted that subjects us to taxation as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.\nThe tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships could be subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly-traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any such changes will ultimately be enacted. It is possible, however, that a change in law could affect us, and any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.\nOur unitholders\u2019 share of our income will be taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. Because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder\u2019s allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to the unitholder. This allocation of taxable income may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability resulting from that income.\nIf the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our distributable cash flow to our unitholders. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we have taken or may take, and the IRS\u2019s positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our positions and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our General Partner because the costs will reduce our distributable cash flow.\nTax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. If our unitholders sell common units, they will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder\u2019s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the tax basis of the unitholder\u2019s common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units a unitholder sells will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if the unitholder sells such common units at a price greater than the unitholder\u2019s tax basis in those common units, even if the price received is less than the original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder\u2019s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, a unitholder that sells common units may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale.\nTax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.\nWe treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could result in more tax to you and may adversely affect the value of the common units. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. Our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of such filing positions. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations, and, accordingly, our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of this method. The U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly-traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, the proposed Treasury Regulations are not final and do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to challenge our method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nA unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may be required to recognize gain or loss from the disposition. Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may be required to recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units.\nWe have adopted certain valuation methodologies for federal income tax purposes that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between our General Partner and our unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our General Partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our General Partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction between our General Partner and certain of our unitholders.\nA successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of taxable gain from our unitholders\u2019 sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders\u2019 tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules\nK-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the unitholder\u2019s taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for federal income tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections, including a new election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has a publicly-traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a publicly-traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly-traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years.\nAs a result of investing in our common units, you may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties. In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We currently own assets and conduct business in several states. Most of these states currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is your responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units.
