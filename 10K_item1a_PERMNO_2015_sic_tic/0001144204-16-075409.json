{"cik": "1093207", "company": "CROSSROADS SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our prospects could be harmed. In that event, the price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Financial Condition\nA large percentage of our sales come from a few customers, some of whom are also competitors, and these customers generally have no minimum or long-term purchase commitments. The loss of, or a significant reduction in demand from, one or more key customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur sales have been and continue to be concentrated among a few customers. Sales to our top three customers in fiscal 2015 represented 54.1% of total revenue, and HP, our largest customer, represented 37.2% of our total revenue. Furthermore, customers are not obligated to purchase any minimum product volume and our relationships with our customers are terminable at will. In addition, from time to time these customers have solicited, and may in the future solicit, bids from us and our competitors for products and services we are currently providing, which could reduce or terminate all or a part of our relationship with that customer. If we experience declines in revenue from any of our large customers, we could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain of our large customers are also our competitors, and such customers could decide to reduce or terminate their purchases of our products for competitive reasons. Merger and acquisition activity could also increase the risk that large customers reduce or terminate their purchases of our products.\nMany of our tape and disk products are primarily incorporated into larger storage systems or solutions that are marketed and sold to end users by our large original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers as well as our value added resellers (\u201cVARs\u201d), system integrators (\u201cSIs\u201d), and strategic partners. Because of this, we have limited market access to these end users, limiting our ability to reach and influence their purchasing decisions. These market conditions further our reliance on these OEM and other large customers. Thus if they were to significantly reduce, cancel, or delay their orders with us, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe derive much of our revenue from the sales and support of virtual tape servers, and if demand for these systems does not continue, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe derive much of our revenue from the sales of virtual tape servers and associated customer support and services. As a result, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these systems, whether as a result of competing technologies and products, the impact of the continuing weakening of U.S. and global economic conditions, decreases or delays in corporate spending for information technologies, product obsolescence, lack of customer acceptance, technological change, customer budgetary constraints or other factors. If demand for our systems does not grow, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe face significant competition and expect this competition to intensify, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue, reduce our gross margins, and result in the loss of market share.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Other companies have introduced and may in the future introduce new products in the same markets we serve or intend to enter. Currently, we face competition from traditional providers of tape-based storage systems as well as a number of established storage companies that offer a variety of different disk-based storage products. Some of our strategic partners currently market products and services that compete with our products. We also compete with a number of emerging hardware and software companies that may become more significant competitors in the future. In addition, at the low-end of our product line, we may compete with other hardware or software providers that incorporate data storage and protection capabilities in their products. New competitive offerings have been recently announced or introduced in our marketplace by our competitors, and we anticipate additional offerings by our competitors may be announced or introduced in 2016. Further, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, sales and other resources than we do and may in some cases benefit from lower costs than we do. In some cases, they also have more recognizable brands than our own.\nCompetition in the past has resulted in pricing pressure on our products and services, and we anticipate that pricing pressure will increase in the future. Competition has in some instances resulted in a negative impact on the length of our sales cycle, and we may experience longer sales cycles in future periods due to increased competition. In particular, if a large number of orders, or a large dollar value order, is delayed or cancelled, our financial results may be harmed. Competition may result in reduced gross margins for our products, increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase, or the loss of, market share.\nOur sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and future revenues in any period may be lower than our historical revenues or forecasts.\nOur sales are difficult to forecast because the data storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This is particularly true during times of economic slowdown and when selling products that require complex installations. Additional factors that may extend our sales cycle, particularly orders for new products, include:\n\u00b7 the amount of time needed for technical evaluations by customers;\n\u00b7 customers\u2019 budget constraints and changes to customers\u2019 budgets during the course of the sales cycle;\n\u00b7 customers\u2019 internal review and testing procedures;\n\u00b7 the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 our engineering work necessary to integrate a storage solution with a customer\u2019s system;\n\u00b7 the complexity of technical challenges that need to be overcome during the development, testing or qualification process for new products or new customers;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our IP revenue;\n\u00b7 meeting unique customer specifications and requirements; and\n\u00b7 difficulties by our customers in integrating our products and technologies into their own products.\nOur product revenue is difficult for us to predict since it is directly affected by the timing of orders. In addition, our operating expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations as to future sales. As a result, if sales levels are below expectations, our operating results may be disproportionately affected. We cannot assure you that our sales will not decline in future periods.\nSome of our revenue is subject to the pricing policies of our customers over whom we have no control.\nWe have no control over our customers' pricing of their products and there can be no assurance that licensed products will be competitively priced or will sell in significant volumes. One important requirement for licensed technology is that any premium charged by our customers in the price of their products utilizing our licensed technology over alternatives needs to be reasonable in comparison to the perceived benefits of the products. If the benefits of our technology do not match the price premium charged by our customers, the resulting decline in sales of products incorporating our technology could harm our operating results.\nOur products handle mission-critical data for our customers and are highly technical in nature. If customer data is lost or corrupted, or our products contain software errors or hardware defects, we could have product liability exposure and our reputation and business could be harmed.\nOur products are involved in storing and replicating mission-critical data for our customers, which is highly technical and complex. If any data is lost or corrupted in connection with the use of our products, our reputation could be seriously harmed and market acceptance of our products could suffer. In addition, our products have contained and may in the future contain software errors, hardware defects or security vulnerabilities. We rely on our suppliers to deliver high quality components for use in our products and we have limited or no control over our suppliers\u2019 product development and production processes. Some software errors or defects in the hardware components of our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers, which could increase our support costs, reduce our margins and harm our reputation among our customers. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products.\nWe face potential liability for performance problems of our products because our end users employ our storage technologies for the storage and backup of important data and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Although we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or accrual of litigation costs that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business.\nIn addition, we could potentially face claims for product liability from our customers if our products cause property damage or bodily injury. Although we maintain general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or accrual of litigation costs that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business.\nFocusing our business model on leveraging OEM and strategic partners with respect to sales of the StrongBox product and intellectual property monetization may not result in anticipated benefits.\nAs we announced in 2013, we undertook a significant reduction in force and are focusing our strategy primarily on leveraging OEM and strategic partners with respect to the Crossroads StrongBox product and are also focusing our efforts on realizing the value of our intellectual property. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies with evolving business strategies. In particular, these new strategies may not have the business success that we hope for and our reduction in force may not ultimately result in the cost savings that management anticipates. Our strategy may place increased demands on our personnel and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent, and to perform our accounting, finance and administrative functions. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business would be harmed.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our senior management and key technical and sales personnel. Our management and employees can terminate their employment at any time, and the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Our success also is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract additional personnel for all areas of our organization, particularly in our sales and research and development departments. Our dependence on attracting and retaining qualified personnel is particularly significant in light of our reduction in force announced in October 2013. Following that reduction in force, we have less redundancy and excess capacity in our workforce, which heightens the risks and potential negative consequences that could result from the departure of certain key management, technical or sales personnel that we may have difficulty replacing.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we were unable to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and other personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business would be harmed.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results.\nIn the year ended October 31, 2015, we derived approximately 15.4% of our revenue from international customers. We expect to continue to add personnel in additional countries. Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the difficulty of managing and staffing international offices and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u00b7 our executive officers\u2019 lack of proximity to the international activities being managed and the inherent limitations of cross-border information flow;\n\u00b7 the management of our relationships with distributors outside the United States, whose sales and lead generation activities are very important to our international operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u00b7 tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u00b7 increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u00b7 potential exposure to adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7 shortages in component parts and raw materials;\n\u00b7 import and export and trade regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict our ability to transport our products;\n\u00b7 the burden and cost of complying with foreign and U.S. laws governing corporate conduct outside the U.S.;\n\u00b7 potential restrictions on the transfer of funds between countries;\n\u00b7 import and export duties and value-added taxes;\n\u00b7 natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons and tsunamis;\n\u00b7 increased exposure to possible violations of U.S. laws regulating the export of our products, and to other U.S. and foreign laws affecting the conduct of business globally such as product certification, environmental and waste management and data privacy laws;\n\u00b7 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u00b7 political and economic instability.\nSales to international customers may also result in greater shipping costs and additional expenses to conform our products to the requirements of local laws or local product specifications. As we continue to expand our business internationally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to successfully manage any of these risks could harm our international operations, reduce or delay our international sales, result in fines and penalties, and reduce profitability on a dollar adjusted basis.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.\nFor the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net losses of approximately $9.0 million and $9.2 million, respectively. We may incur additional losses in future periods. We expect to make significant expenditures related to the development of our business. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including those discussed in other risk factors and factors that we cannot foresee. In addition, continued losses may cause us to undertake cost reduction plans. If we undertake cost reduction initiatives or restructuring plans, these plans may adversely impact our operations, may cause us to recognize restructuring or other charges, and may not result in our realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits of these plans.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) or recognize tax benefits on future domestic taxable income may be limited.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing NOLs could be limited or eliminated in various ways. (i) if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value over a rolling three-year period. We may experience an \u201cownership change\u201d in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership, which would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs. (ii) due to changes in federal laws and regulations that could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs; or (iii). should we not reach profitability or be only marginally profitable prior to the expiration of the NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income to be able to utilize our NOLs prior to their expiration.\nIf we fail to manage growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe have restructured our operations significantly since inception and anticipate that further changes of our operations and headcount may be required. Our operating structure has changed recently, and any changes or future growth will place significant demands on our management, infrastructure and other resources. To manage any future change, we will need to hire, train, integrate and retain a number of highly skilled and motivated employees. We will also need to continue to improve our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. We could encounter delays or difficulties in implementing any of these systems. If we do not effectively hire, train, integrate and retain sufficient highly qualified personnel to support any future growth, and if we do not effectively manage the associated increases in expenses, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nAny shortages in components used in our products could delay shipment of our products or increase our product costs, which could harm our business.\nSignificant time and effort would be required to locate new vendors for the components we use in our products, if available at all, to qualify replacement components or to develop our products using alternative suppliers. The unavailability of any necessary components could delay or prevent us from shipping our products. Component suppliers may be vulnerable to pressure from large purchasers of their products, who may be competitors of ours, to allocate available component supplies to them. The global economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers and their liquidity, and the availability of, or terms and conditions on which we purchase, their products and services. In addition, increased demand generally by third parties for the components we use in our products may lead to decreased availability and higher prices for those components.\nIf we experience shortages in components that we use in our products, or do not accurately predict the availability of and demand for such components, or if new product introductions by our suppliers do not meet our expectations for timing, availability, functionality, performance, quality or price, then our business and gross margins could be negatively impacted, and our reputation and customer relationships could be harmed.\nOur business and operating results may be harmed if we undertake any restructuring activities.\nFrom time to time, we may undertake to restructure our business, such as the reductions in our workforce that we announced during 2013. There are several factors that could cause a restructuring to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include potential disruption of our operations, the development of our technology, the deliveries to our customers and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and we may lose employees whom we want to keep. Loss of sales, service and engineering talent, in particular, could damage our business.\nAny restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work. Employee reductions or other restructuring activities also cause us to incur restructuring and related expenses such as severance expenses. Moreover, we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans, which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense\nRecent turmoil in the financial markets and the global economic conditions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry, business and gross margins.\nThe challenging economic conditions in the U.S. and world economic markets and the future economic environment may continue to adversely affect our business. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, in particular for data storage and protection products for backup storage and network-based disaster recovery. Information technology spending has historically declined with worsening general economic and market conditions, and we believe the economic conditions previously caused our customers to significantly reduce or delay their information technology purchases and that these reductions and delays negatively impacted demand for our products and services and our business. If the U.S. and global economic conditions worsen and if our customers believe economic conditions will not improve or a downturn will occur in the foreseeable future, then our customers may continue to significantly reduce their information technology budgets and may decrease their demand for our products and services.\nAs a result of this economic slowdown and the ongoing tightening of credit markets, our customers may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, necessary financing for their purchases of our products. A lack of liquidity in the capital markets or the continued global economic conditions may cause our customers to delay or cancel their purchases, increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations.\nThe global economic conditions may not only cause our customers to significantly reduce or delay their information technology budgets, which would negatively impact demand for our products and services, but may also result in:\n\u00b7 increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors, but also as a result of our customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 utilization of inventoried or underutilized products, which could put additional pressure on our near term gross profits;\n\u00b7 risk of excess or obsolete inventories;\n\u00b7 excess engineering capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue; and\n\u00b7 more limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance.\nAs a result of the recent and ongoing economic conditions, we may face new risks that we have not yet identified. In addition, a number of the risks associated with our business, which are disclosed in these risk factors, may increase in likelihood, magnitude or duration.\nLitigation, Regulation and Business Risks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe face current and potential adverse determinations in litigation stemming from our efforts to protect and enforce our patents and intellectual property rights and make other claims, which could broadly impact our intellectual property rights and our ability to conduct our business as currently operated, distract our management and cause substantial expenses and declines in our revenue and stock price.\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments.\nDeveloping our products is expensive and our investment in product development may involve a long investment return cycle. For the year ended October 31, 2015, our research and development expenses were approximately $4.8 million, or approximately 61.1% of revenue. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. These investments may not generate positive returns in the near term, or at all.\nEfforts to protect our intellectual property rights and to defend claims against us can increase our costs and will not always succeed; any failures could adversely affect revenues and profitability.\nIntellectual property rights are crucial to our business, particularly our technology licensing programs. We endeavor to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and in selected international markets. Our IP licensing revenue for the year ended October 31, 2015 was $1.0 million, or approximately 12.6% of revenues, and our IP licensing revenue for the year October 31, 2014 was $1.9 million, or approximately 16.8% of revenues. If we experience a decline in revenue from our licensees, as a result of economic conditions, customers\u2019 business performance, or otherwise, we could be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to retain all of our intellectual property protection. Even if protection is obtained, competitors or others in the chain of commerce may raise legal challenges to our rights or illegally infringe on our rights, including through means that may be difficult to prevent or detect. For example, much of our proprietary technology resides in software that frequently is not publicly available and has prevented and may continue to prevent us from realizing the full value of our intellectual property. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, and the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions, competitors may be issued patents from applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance. These patents could reduce the value of our intellectual property, to the extent they cover technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require that we seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to our business. We cannot assure we would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms. The extent to which we succeed or fail in our efforts to protect our intellectual property will affect our costs, sales and other results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we will be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. Further, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even issued patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of our own intellectual property and that of others. Such litigation could be costly and divert management resources, either of which could harm our business. We have also identified a number of companies that we believe may infringe our intellectual property, and there are likely others in our industry that infringe our intellectual property that we have not yet identified. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce and defend their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to successfully identify third-party infringement or prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, nor can we ensure that we will not be accused of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others.\nAdverse outcomes in legal proceedings could subject us to substantial damages and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are involved in major lawsuits concerning intellectual property and other matters, which are time-consuming and the outcomes of which may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized or limit our ability to engage in our business activities. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to great uncertainty, and although we intend to vigorously pursue our claims, there are no guarantees that we can protect our intellectual property rights in our current litigation or related proceedings, settle any of the current litigation actions, prevail in any of the current litigation actions or related proceedings or prevent the unauthorized use of our technology now and in the future. Further, any favorable result we receive at the trial level or at the U.S. Patent Office may be appealed by the other party. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and, at a minimum, delay in receiving revenue. A successful appeal could overturn entirely any positive result for the company from a trial court or the U.S. Patent Office. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries, trial courts, the U.S. Patent Office or an appellate court.\nAdditionally, unintended consequences of our litigation may adversely affect our business, including, without limitation, that we may have to devote significant time and financial resources to pursuing the litigation, that we have become subject to counterclaims or lawsuits and may become subject to additional counterclaims and lawsuits, that the parties we pursue claims against have filed actions, and may file additional actions, with the government (including inter partes review proceedings) to attempt to invalidate or render our patents unenforceable, and that the expenses of pursuing the litigation and related proceedings could increase based upon these counterclaims, lawsuits, inter partes review proceedings or new developments in the pending proceedings. In addition, if we do not prevail in our patent litigation or in the inter partes review proceedings, the consequences could include the circumvention or invalidation of our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our ongoing licensing program, our ability to enforce our existing licenses, and the ability to recover damages based on infringement of our patents. Additionally, an adverse result in a counterclaim or lawsuit against us, or an inter partes review proceeding, could result in our not having the intellectual property rights necessary to practice our business as currently operated or to sell our products, including our StrongBox products. These and other factors not currently known to or deemed material by management, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, and results of operations.\nWe have transferred ownership of the non-\u2018972 Patents to a limited partnership with an affiliate of Fortress that we do not fully control, and efforts by this limited partnership to generate revenues from the transferred patents and patent applications may not be successful.\nAs described above, in connection with a July 2013 secured loan transaction with Fortress, we transferred substantially all of our non-\u2018972 patents to a limited partnership of which an affiliate of Fortress is the general partner. Fortress generally has the power to manage, control and conduct the business and affairs of the partnership. While the limited partnership agreement gives us the right to consent to certain actions, as a limited partner we do not control the partnership and have a limited ability to direct any licensing and monetization activities without Fortress\u2019s consent.\nThis partnership poses risks not otherwise present when we alone seek to license our technology. For example: Fortress, may or may not take actions that we believe to be in our best interest; we may incur liabilities as a result of actions taken, or not taken, by the partnership; we may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the partnership, including litigation and licensing matters, as well management of the partnership relationship; any strategy or other disputes between us and Fortress may result in delays, expenses or operational impasses; and while we have retained a fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the assigned patents, these patents are now owned by a third party not under our control, and will remain as such unless and until we are able to buy out Fortress\u2019s interest in the partnership.\nThis partnership may attempt to pursue patent licensing and enforcement activity that may generate revenues for us. However, we cannot predict the success of those efforts or when revenues, if any, are generated. Any efforts to generate such revenues may require us to expend significant monetary resources. Until the Company has exercised its option to repurchase Fortress\u2019s interest in the partnership, any revenues generated from a licensing program will be subject to the revenue sharing agreement defined in the limited partnership agreement. These limitations on our ability to monetize our non-\u2019972 patent family could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy to license and/or monetize the value of our intellectual property through enforcement or other strategies may not be successful.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this filing, we maintain an active licensing program related to our \u2018972 patent family, and we are in the process of developing a campaign to monetize our non-\u2019972 patents.\nOur strategy to monetize our non-\u2019972 patents is in the preliminary stage. At this time, with the assistance of third party consultants, we are developing a strategy to pursue one or more alternative methods of monetizing the non-\u2019972 patents, which may include one or more of the following strategies:\n\u00b7 a sale of all or a portion of the patent family;\n\u00b7 pursuing litigation against companies we believe are infringing our rights under this patent family in order to encourage these companies to take a license to our technology (whether alone or in partnership with a law firm or firms that may take a contingent recovery);\n\u00b7 one or more strategic partnerships with a patent monetization company, in which case we would share a portion of the license revenues with the strategic partners taking responsibility for some or all expenses related to licensing (including litigation); or\n\u00b7 entering into arrangements with lenders or financial partners in order to fund litigation.\nSome of these strategies could be costly, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund such strategies ourselves nor be able to raise financing or enter into a partnership to provide for such funding. We cannot predict with certainty the time it would take to achieve any revenues from such strategies, and we cannot assure you such activities will, in fact, generate revenue. As stated above, there also are contractual limits on our ability to monetize our non-\u2019972 patents.\nIf we are unable to develop and manufacture new products that achieve acceptance in the data protection and the network storage software markets, our operating results may suffer.\nThe data protection and the network storage software markets continue to evolve and as a result there is continuing demand for new products. Accordingly, we may need to develop and manufacture new products that address additional data protection or network storage software market segments and emerging technologies to remain competitive in the data storage software industry. We are uncertain whether we will successfully qualify new data protection or network storage software products with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications. Any failure to address additional market segments could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry and changes in existing technologies or the emergence of new products or technologies could reduce demand for our products and significantly harm our business.\nThe data storage market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and technology introductions, evolving industry standards, industry consolidation, and evolving customer preferences. The introduction of new products by our competitors or us, or new storage market entrants, could render our existing products obsolete or uncompetitive. Additionally, changes in existing technologies could cause demand for our products to decline. For example, if changes in technology result in a significant reduction in the price for hard disk drives, enterprises may not need to utilize information security, data protection, information assurance, business information assurance, business continuity, disaster recovery, data privacy, risk management, fraud prevention, corporate governance and regulatory compliance products or services. One or more new technologies also could be introduced that compete favorably with our products or that cause our products to no longer be of significant benefit to our customers. In addition, because our products work with enterprise backup software applications to transfer and store data in the storage environment, we are dependent on enterprises\u2019 use of these applications for data protection and disaster recovery purposes. If enterprises adopt products or technologies that enable them to protect and recover their data, demand for our products and services could be reduced significantly.\nOur operating results depend on new product introductions, which may not be successful, in which case our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nTo compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new ones. We have devoted and expect to continue to devote considerable management and financial resources to these efforts. We cannot provide assurance that:\n\u00b7 we will introduce new products in the timeframe we forecast;\n\u00b7 we will not experience technical, quality, performance-related, or other difficulties that could prevent or delay the introduction and market acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7 our new products will achieve market acceptance and significant market share, or that the markets for these products will continue or grow as we have anticipated;\n\u00b7 our new products will be successfully or timely qualified with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications which must occur before customers will place large product orders; or\n\u00b7 we will achieve high volume production of these new products in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf we are not successful in timely completion of our new product qualifications and then ramping sales to our key customers, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, if the quality of our products is not acceptable to our customers, this could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue, and increased warranty and repair costs.\nThe inability of our products to interoperate with backup software applications would cause our product and licensing business to suffer.\nWe have designed our products to interoperate with the leading enterprise backup software applications available in the market. If our products are not compatible with the leading backup software applications, demand for our products will decline. Some backup software providers currently offer products that compete with ours and other providers may do so in the future. Backup software providers may in the future make changes that would diminish the ability of our products to interoperate with their applications. If this were to occur, we may need to spend significant time and effort to ensure the continued compatibility of our products, which may not be possible. Any of these developments could significantly harm our business.\nOur products must conform to industry standards and integrate smoothly with user systems in order to be accepted by customers in our markets.\nWe offer our software on a stand-alone basis and as part of a product in which we install our software onto third party hardware. Our current products are only one part of a storage system. All components of these systems must comply with the same industry standards in order to operate together efficiently. We depend on companies that provide other components of these systems to conform to industry standards. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by OEM customers or end users. If other providers of components do not support the same industry standards as we do, if competing standards emerge or if our products are not easy to deploy or do not integrate smoothly with end user systems, our products may not achieve market acceptance, which would adversely affect our business.\nIssues with the hardware on which our software products are installed could increase our support costs and result in lower sales of our products.\nWe deliver some of our products, both through our resellers and directly to end-users, installed on third party hardware. If the hardware does not function properly, our support costs will go up. We will have to arrange or pay for the repair or replacement of the broken hardware and we may have to increase the size of our support operations. Hardware reliability issues could also result in reputational harm to our company and could cause partners and end-users to refuse to make purchases from us, even if our software products function properly.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur headquarters facilities contain redundant power supplies and generators. However, our domestic and foreign operations, and the operation of our strategic and OEM partners, VARs, SIs and others, remain susceptible to fire, floods, tornadoes, power loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. In addition, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Acts of terrorism or war could also cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or delay the manufacture and shipment of our products, our business would be harmed.\nFailure of IT and telecommunications systems for product sales and licensing could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company depends on IT and telecommunications systems for our operations. These systems support a variety of functions including data storage and retrieval, order processing, shipping, shipment tracking, billing, support center and internal information exchange around the globe. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns, some of which were caused by organized attacks. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. Security breakdowns, disruptions or breaches that compromise sensitive information, could harm our relationship with our customers. Our support centers are dependent upon telephone and data services provided by third party telecommunications service vendors and our IT and telecommunications system. Any significant increase in our IT and telecommunications costs or temporary or permanent loss of our IT or telecommunications systems could harm our relationships with our customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Capitalization Matters and Corporate Governance\nThe share price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in these risk factors and elsewhere in our reports and other documents filed with the SEC, factors that may cause volatility in our share price include:\n\u00b7 our ability to meet our working capital needs;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts who may cover our stock or by our failure to meet the estimates made by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic relationships or joint ventures;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 any deviations in net sales or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 unfavorable legal or regulatory rulings associated with the enforcement of our IP rights;\n\u00b7 the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this annual report; and\n\u00b7 future sales of common stock.\nFurthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, international currency fluctuations or political unrest, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over research and reports these analysts publish or whether they will be published at all. If one or more of the analysts who decide to cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf our common stock is delisted, the market value of, and your ability to transfer or sell, shares of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet specified financial requirements, including requirements that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for our common stock and that we maintain (i) a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,500,000, (ii) a minimum market value of listed common stock of $35,000,000, or (iii) net income from continuing operations of at least $500,000 in the most recent fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years.\nOn July 22, 2015, we received a written notification from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that the Company did not satisfy the minimum $35 million in market value of listed securities requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the prior 30 consecutive business days, or the alternative requirement of $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity as of its most recent periodic report, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550. Nasdaq has granted the Company a 180-day period to evidence compliance with the $35 million market value of listed securities requirement, through January 19, 2016. If the Company does not regain compliance by the deadline, the Company could be subject to delisting or suspension action.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, your ability to transfer or sell your shares of common stock may be limited and the market value of common stock may be materially adversely affected as a result of lower trading volumes or trade delays. Further, delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our securities, affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs and diminish investor, business partner and employee confidence.\nWe face a challenging liquidity environment and may require additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain necessary financing or doing so on unfavorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing, cash flows from operations, and IP licensing and settlement revenue to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. We currently face a difficult liquidity environment, and expect to require significant capital expenditures as we continue to introduce StrongBox into the marketplace. Expected revenue from our StrongBox product has been slower to materialize than expected, limiting our cash provided by operations from sales of StrongBox. We also may require additional capital from equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations, respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or pursue our intellectual property monetization strategy.\nWe may not be able to secure timely additional financing arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business, to bring our products to market, to respond to business challenges and to pursue our intellectual property monetization strategy could be significantly limited.\nOur system of internal controls may be inadequate.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls in order to ensure we are able to collect, process, summarize, and disclose the information required by the SEC within the time periods specified. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Additionally, public companies in the United States are required to review their internal controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or fail to perform as anticipated, errors could occur that would not be detected, which could require us to restate our consolidated financial statements, result in an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or require us to take other actions that will divert significant financial and managerial resources, as well as be subject to fines and/or other government enforcement actions. Furthermore, the price of our stock could be adversely affected and our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on or repurchase any shares of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends is limited by law and our other financing arrangements.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. The Series F Convertible Preferred Stock has the right to receive dividends that accrue at a rate of 5.00% annually, are payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and are payable, at our option, in cash or common stock with reference to the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock on its principle trading market.\nExcept as required by the terms of our preferred stock, any payment of future dividends on our securities will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. In addition, our credit agreement with Fortress prohibits us from paying cash dividends, making distributions or payments or redeeming, retiring or purchasing any of our capital stock and our shares of convertible preferred stock have dividend rights that rank senior to our common stock and include a covenant limiting our ability to pay dividends while at least 20% of the currently issued convertible preferred stock is outstanding. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.\nOur convertible preferred stock contains covenants that may limit our business flexibility.\nOur convertible preferred stock contains covenants preventing us from taking certain actions without the approval of the holders of a majority or a super-majority of the convertible preferred stock, depending on the action as described below. The need to obtain the approval of holders of our convertible preferred stock before taking these actions could impede our ability to take certain actions that management or our board of directors may consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFor as long as at least 20% of the shares of our convertible preferred stock issued in our March 2013 private placement are outstanding, we may not take any of the following actions, among others, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding:\n\u00b7 create a new class or series of equity securities or any other security convertible into equity securities ranking senior or pari passu to the convertible preferred stock with respect to voting, dividends, or liquidation rights;\n\u00b7 amend, alter, or repeal any of our governing documents in a manner materially adverse to our convertible preferred stock;\n\u00b7 declare or pay a dividend or distribution on any securities, including our common stock, prior to the payment of the dividends required to be paid to holders of our convertible preferred stock; or\n\u00b7 repurchase or otherwise acquire more than a de minimis number of shares of any class of securities junior to the convertible preferred stock (which includes our common stock), except with respect to (1) shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of shares of our convertible preferred stock or the exercise of warrants issued in our March 2013 private placement, or (2) repurchases of certain securities held by our departing officers and directors up to an aggregate maximum of $100,000.\nFor as long as at least 20% of the shares of our convertible preferred stock issued in our March 2013 private placement are outstanding, we also may not take any of the following actions, among others, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least 70% of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding:\n\u00b7 sell (outside the ordinary course) or hypothecate any of our current or future assets (other than for hypothecations pursuant to and consistent with our existing working capital arrangements); or\n\u00b7 incur any new debt (including redeemable preferred stock), other than pursuant to our existing working capital relationship and trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of business; provided , however, that the foregoing restrictions will not apply to:\n\u00b7 any assignment, conveyance, disposition, encumbrance, hypothecation, pledge, lease, sale, transfer or other disposition our intellectual property that (1) generates net proceeds of at least $3 million and (2) does not cause a material adverse effect on us or our current and anticipated operations including our StrongBox line of products, and\n\u00b7 license arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nWe cannot assure you that the holders of our convertible preferred stock would approve any such restricted action, even where we believe such an action would be in the best interests of our stockholders. Any failure to obtain such approval could limit our business flexibility, harm our business and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock or convertible preferred stock.\nWe do not have cumulative voting and a small number of existing shareholders exert significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of shareholder votes.\nOur shareholders do not have the right to cumulative votes in the election of our directors. Cumulative voting, in some cases, could allow a minority group to elect at least one director to our board. Because there is no provision for cumulative voting, a minority group will not be able to elect any directors. Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy, will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with our largest shareholders, beneficially own a majority of our common stock as of January 7, 2016. As a result, these persons may be able to exercise significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nFrom time to time we may make acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may make acquisitions in the future. We may also make significant investments in companies, products or technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or significant investments, it could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Risks that we may face in our efforts to integrate any recent or future acquisitions include, among others:\n\u00b7 failure to realize anticipated savings and benefits from the acquisition;\n\u00b7 difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees;\n\u00b7 potential incompatibility of business cultures;\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u00b7 coordinating infrastructure operations in a rapid and efficient manner;\n\u00b7 the potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services;\n\u00b7 potential difficulties in monetizing or defending our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 failure of acquired technology or products to provide anticipated revenue or margin contribution;\n\u00b7 insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7 costs and delays in implementing or integrating common systems and procedures;\n\u00b7 reduction or loss of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay;\n\u00b7 impairment of existing customer, supplier and strategic relationships of either company;\n\u00b7 insufficient cash flows from operations to fund the working capital and investment requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7 the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment, the original investment may become impaired or we may incur losses from these investments;\n\u00b7 dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company;\n\u00b7 the assumption of risks of the acquired company that are difficult to quantify, such as litigation;\n\u00b7 the cost associated with the acquisition; and\n\u00b7 assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated adverse events or circumstances.\nAcquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. For example, in 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, as we continue to review and monitor this new law and its associated regulations, we expect to incur additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThese laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies provide new guidance. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations, we may find that it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform legislation.\nIn March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act was passed and signed into law. Provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years, and many of the regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation have not been implemented. Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected due to this health reform legislation.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the rights of the holders of our convertible preferred stock to elect one director;\n\u00b7 the rights of the holders of our convertible preferred stock to approve certain transactions and corporate actions;\n\u00b7 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nWe adopted a tax benefits preservation plan, designed to preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax NOLs, which may discourage acquisition and sale of large blocks of our stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\nOn May 23, 2014, we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the \u201cTax Benefit Preservation Plan\u201d). The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of certain income tax assets primarily associated with NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock (including shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock) without the approval of the Board. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may discourage existing 5% stockholders from selling their interest in a single block which may impact the liquidity of our common stock, may deter institutional investors from investing in our stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire us. These factors may depress the market price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 87310, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "CRSS"}
