{"cik": "810136", "company": "PHOTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's dependency on the semiconductor industry, which as a whole is volatile, could have a negative material impact on its business.\nThe Company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers, manufacturers and foundries, as well as to other high performance electronics manufacturers. The Company believes that the demand for photomasks depends primarily on design activity rather than sales volume from products using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. In addition, the reduced use of customized ICs, a reduction in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if the demand for semiconductors and FPDs increases. Further, advances in design and production methods for semiconductors and other high performance electronics could reduce the demand for photomasks. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been volatile, with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices.\nThe Company's results may suffer if either the IC or FPD photomask market does not grow or if the Company is unable to serve these markets successfully. The Company believes that the demand for photomasks for both ICs and FPDs depends primarily on design activity and, to a lesser extent, upon an increase in the number of production facilities used to manufacture ICs or FPDs. As a result, an increase in IC or FPD sales will not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in photomask sales. A slowdown in the development of new technologies for fabricating ICs or FPDs could reduce the demand for related photomasks even if the demand for ICs or FPDs increases.\nThe Company may incur future net losses.\nAlthough the Company has been profitable since fiscal 2010, it has, in the past, incurred net losses. The net losses experienced in prior years were due, in part, to macroeconomic factors, which resulted in significant charges for restructurings and impairments of long-lived assets. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will not incur net losses in the future.\nThe Company's quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future. Fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the prices of the Company's common stock and financial instruments linked to the value of the Company's common stock. Operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the size and timing of orders and shipments, the loss of significant customers, changes in product mix, the flow of customer design releases, technological change, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, competition and general economic conditions. The Company operates in a high fixed cost environment and, should its revenues and asset utilization decrease, its operating margins could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company's customers generally order photomasks on an as-needed basis, and the Company's net sales in any quarter are dependent on orders received during that quarter. Since the Company operates with little backlog and the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, the Company's capital expenditures and, to some extent, expense levels are based primarily on sales forecasts and technological advancements in photomask manufacturing equipment. Consequently, if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur when expected, capital expenditures and expense levels could be disproportionately high, and the Company's operating results would be adversely affected. Due to the foregoing factors, the Company believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. In addition, in future quarters the Company's operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which, in turn, could materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe photomask industry is subject to rapid technological change and the Company might fail to remain competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe photomask industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. In order to remain competitive, the Company will be required to continually anticipate, respond to and utilize changing technologies of increasing complexity in both traditional and emerging markets that it serves. In particular, the Company believes that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller and FPDs become larger with improved performance, it will be required to manufacture increasingly complex photomasks. Additionally, the demand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs. Furthermore, increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring IC designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors. As of the end of fiscal 2014, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered to be too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production. However, should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring IC designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance, and if the Company is unable to anticipate, respond to or utilize these or other technological changes, due to resource, technological or other constraints, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's operations will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, for which it may be unable to obtain funding.\nThe manufacture of photomasks requires substantial investments by the Company in high-end manufacturing capability. The Company expects that it will be required to continue to make substantial capital expenditures to meet the technological demands of its customers and to position itself for future growth. The Company's capital expenditure payments for fiscal 2015 are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, of which $31 million was included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on its November 2, 2014, Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to obtain the additional capital required to fund its operations on reasonable terms, if at all, or that any such inability will not have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe Company's agreements with Micron have several risks; should either company not comply or execute under these agreements it could significantly disrupt the Company's business and technological activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and cash flows.\nIn 2006 Photronics and Micron entered into a joint venture known as MP Mask. The joint venture develops and produces photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors. As part of the formation of the joint venture, Micron contributed its existing photomask technology center located at its Boise, Idaho, headquarters to MP Mask and Photronics paid Micron $135 million in exchange for a 49.99% interest in MP Mask, a license for photomask technology of Micron and certain supply agreements. Since the formation of the joint venture, the Company has, through November 2, 2014, made contributions to MP Mask of $38 million and received returns of investments of $10 million.\nMP Mask is governed by a Board of Managers, appointed by Micron and the Company. Since MP Mask's inception, Micron, as a result of its majority ownership, has held majority voting power on the Board of Managers. The voting power held by each party is subject to change as ownership interests change. Under the MP Mask joint venture operating agreement, the Company may be required to make additional capital contributions to MP Mask up to the maximum amount defined in the operating agreement. However, should the Board of Managers determine that further additional funding is required, MP Mask would need to pursue its own financing. If MP Mask is unable to obtain its own financing, it may request additional capital contributions from the Company. Should the Company choose not to make a requested contribution to MP Mask, its ownership percentage may be reduced.\nThe failure of Photronics or Micron to comply or execute under any of these agreements, capitalize on the use of existing technology or further develop technology could result in a significant disruption to the Company's business and technological activities, and could adversely affect the Company's operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has been dependent on sales to a limited number of large customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in orders from these customers could have a material adverse effect on its sales and results of operations.\nHistorically, the Company has sold a significant proportion of photomasks to a limited number of IC and FPD manufacturers. During fiscal 2014, the Company\u2019s two largest customers by sales volume accounted for 16% and 11% of its net sales. The Company's five largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 44%, 43% and 43% of net sales in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. None of the Company's customers have entered into a significant long-term agreement with the Company requiring them to purchase the Company's products. The loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction or delay in orders from any significant customer, (including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns), or an unfavorable change in market, economic, or competitive conditions in the semiconductor or FPD industries, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance and business prospects. The consolidation of semiconductor manufacturers or an economic downturn in the semiconductor industry may increase the likelihood of losing a significant customer and could also have an adverse effect on the Company's financial performance and business prospects.\nThe Company depends on a small number of suppliers for equipment and raw materials and, if the Company's suppliers do not deliver their products to it, the Company may be unable to deliver its products to its customers, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of photomask equipment manufacturers to develop and supply the equipment it uses. These equipment manufacturers currently require lead times of up to twelve months or longer between the order and the delivery of certain photomask imaging and inspection equipment. The failure of such manufacturers to develop or deliver such equipment on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, the manufacturing equipment necessary to produce advanced photomasks could become prohibitively expensive, which could similarly affect the Company.\nThe Company uses high precision quartz photomask blanks, pellicles, and electronic grade chemicals in its manufacturing processes. There are a limited number of suppliers of these raw materials. The Company has no long-term contracts for the supply of these raw materials. Any delays or quality problems in connection with significant raw materials, particularly photomask blanks, could cause delays in the shipments of photomasks, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates, with respect to prices of equipment and raw materials used in manufacturing, could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the use of sophisticated equipment and complex manufacturing processes and technologies. The inability of the Company to effectively utilize such equipment and technologies and perform such processes could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe Company's complex manufacturing processes require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials, and are continually modified in an effort to improve manufacturing yields and product quality. Minute impurities, defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower manufacturing yields and make products unmarketable. Moreover, manufacturing leading-edge photomasks is more complex and time consuming than manufacturing less advanced photomasks, and may lead to delays in the manufacturing of all levels of photomasks. The Company has, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties and capacity limitations that have delayed the Company's ability to deliver products within the time frames contracted for by its customers. The Company cannot provide assurance that, under such circumstances, it will not experience these or other manufacturing difficulties, or be subject to increased costs or production capacity constraints in the future, any of which could result in a loss of customers or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe Company's debt agreements limit its ability to obtain financing and may obligate the Company to repay debt before its maturity.\nFinancial covenants related to the Company\u2019s credit facility, which was last amended in August 2014, include Total Leverage Ratio, a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, and Minimum Unrestricted Cash Balances. Existing covenant restrictions limit the Company's ability to obtain additional debt financing and, should Photronics be unable to meet one or more of these covenants, its lenders may require the Company to repay any outstanding balance prior to the expiration date of the agreements. The Company's ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in its debt agreements may be affected by worsening economic or business conditions, or other events. The Company cannot assure that, under such circumstances, additional sources of financing would be available to pay off any long-term borrowings, so as to avoid default. Should the Company default on certain of its long-term borrowings, a cross default would occur on other long-term borrowings, unless amended or waived.\nAcquisitions, mergers or joint ventures by the Company may entail certain operational and financial risks.\nThe Company has made significant acquisitions throughout its history and it may make other acquisitions or participate in other joint ventures or mergers in the future. As discussed above, in 2014 PSMC, the Company\u2019s wholly owned Taiwanese manufacturing subsidiary, merged with DPTT, a wholly owned subsidiary of DNP. Such transactions are subject to acquisition accounting, as prescribed in ASC 805 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, under which identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests are generally recognized at their acquisition date fair values and separately from goodwill, if any, that may be required to be recognized. Goodwill, when recognizable, would be measured as the excess amount of any consideration transferred, which is generally measured at fair value, over the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In cases of acquisitions that require the Company to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such estimates, though based upon assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, are subject to uncertainty. After the completion of such an acquisition, if in fact the transaction is consummated, the Company may be subject to various risks which could adversely affect its future earnings and cash flows. These may include that: the cost of combining the operations of the acquired company with the Company\u2019s operations may exceed the Company\u2019s estimates; goodwill, if any, or other intangible assets recognized may be subject to impairment charges; the lives of intangible assets acquired may be reduced; contingent liabilities are identified or change; the unanticipated loss of sales due to an overlap of customers served by the Company and the acquiree occurs; and that greater than anticipated charges to maintain duplicate pre-merger activities and eliminate duplicative activities are experienced. Furthermore, the Company may need to utilize its cash reserves and/or issue new securities to fund future acquisitions, which could have a dilutive effect on its earnings per share.\nThe Company's cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate for its current and long-term needs.\nThe Company's liquidity is highly dependent on its sales volume and the timing of its capital expenditures, (which can vary significantly from period to period), as it operates in a high fixed cost environment. Depending on conditions in the semiconductor and FPD markets, the Company's cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet its current and long-term needs for capital expenditures, operations and debt repayments. Historically, in certain years, the Company has used external financing to fund these needs. Due to conditions in the credit markets and covenant restrictions on its existing debt, some financing instruments used by the Company in the past may not be available to it. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that additional sources of financing would be available to it on commercially favorable terms, if at all, should its cash requirements exceed its cash available from operations, existing cash, and cash available under its credit facility.\nThe Company may incur unforeseen charges related to possible future facility closures or restructurings.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that there will not be facility closures or restructurings in the near or long-term, nor can it assure that it will not incur significant charges, should there be any future facility closures or restructurings.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment and, should it be unable to meet its customers\u2019 requirements for product quality, timeliness of delivery or technical capabilities, its sales could be adversely affected.\nThe photomask industry is highly competitive, and most of the Company's customers utilize more than one photomask supplier. The Company's competitors include Compugraphics International, Ltd., DNP (outside of Taiwan), Hoya Corporation, SK-Electronics Co., Ltd., Taiwan Mask Corporation and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. The Company also competes with semiconductor manufacturers' captive photomask manufacturing operations, some of which market their photomask manufacturing services to outside customers. The Company expects to face continued competition from these and other suppliers in the future. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than it has. Also, when producing smaller geometry photomasks, some of the Company's competitors may be able to more rapidly develop, produce, and achieve higher manufacturing yields than the Company. The Company believes that consistency of product quality and timeliness of delivery, as well as price, technical capability, and service are the principal factors considered by customers in selecting their photomask suppliers. The Company's inability to meet these competitive requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. In the past, competition led to pressure to reduce prices which, the Company believes, contributed to the decrease in the number of independent photomask suppliers. This pressure to reduce prices may continue in the future.\nThe Company's substantial international operations are subject to additional risks.\nSales from the Company\u2019s international operations were approximately 77%, 70% and 70% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company believes that maintaining significant international operations requires it to have, among other things, a local presence in the geographic markets that it supplies. This requires significant investments in financial, managerial, operational, and other resources. Since 1996, the Company has significantly expanded its operations in international markets by acquiring existing businesses in Europe, acquiring majority equity interests in photomask manufacturing operations in Korea and Taiwan and building a new manufacturing facility for FPD photomasks in Taiwan. The Company, in order to enable it to optimize its investments and other resources, closely monitors the semiconductor and FPD manufacturing markets for indications of geographic movement and, in conjunction with these efforts, continues to assess the locations of its manufacturing facilities. These assessments may result in the opening or closing of facilities.\nOperations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, unstable political and economic conditions in various countries, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to generate sales outside of the United States and, consequently, on its business and results of operations.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are reported in U.S. dollars. The Company's operations have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, euro, and the pound sterling. In fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a net gain from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.4 million in its statement of income, while its net assets were decreased by $5.9 million as a result of the translation of foreign currency financial statements to U.S. dollars. In the event of significant foreign currency fluctuations, the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's business depends on managerial and technical personnel, who are in great demand, and its inability to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company's success depends, in part, upon key managerial and technical personnel, as well as its ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key managerial, and technical employees, or that it can attract similar additional employees in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to enforce or defend its ownership and use of proprietary technology, and the utilization of unprotected Company developed technology by its competitors could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company believes that the success of its business depends more on its proprietary technology, information and processes, and know-how than on its patents or trademarks. Much of its proprietary information and technology related to manufacturing processes is not patented and may not be patentable. The Company cannot offer assurance that:\n\u00b7 it will be able to adequately protect its technology;\n\u00b7 competitors will not independently develop similar technology; or\n\u00b7 international intellectual property laws will adequately protect its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company may become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products or processes. Any such claims, with or without merit, or litigation to enforce or protect its intellectual property rights, or that require the Company to defend itself against claimed infringements of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, and product shipment delays or could force the Company to enter into royalty or license agreements, rather than dispute the merits of these claims. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company may be unprepared for changes to environmental laws and regulations and may incur liabilities arising from environmental matters.\nThe Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the handling, use, storage, disposal and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes. Changes in these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to adequately comply with these laws and regulations could subject it to significant future liabilities.\nIn addition, these laws and regulations may impose clean-up liabilities on current and former owners and operators of real property as well as parties who arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations owned or operated by others, without regard to fault, so that these liabilities may be joint and several with other parties. In the past, the Company has been involved in remediation activities related to its properties. The Company believes, based upon current information, that environmental liabilities relating to these activities or other matters are not material to its financial position or operations. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any material environmental liabilities in the future.\nThe Company's production facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster or labor strike, either of which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA major catastrophe, such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, labor strike, or work stoppage at any manufacturing facility of the Company, its suppliers, or its customers, could result in a prolonged interruption of the Company\u2019s business. A disruption resulting from any one of these events could cause significant delays in shipments of the Company's products and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company's facilities in Taiwan are located in a seismically active area.\nThe Company's sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy, which could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the U.S. or other countries in which the Company or its customers conduct business may have the effect of reducing the demand for photomasks. Economic downturns may lead to a decrease in demand for end products whose manufacturing processes involve the use of photomasks, which may result in a reduction in new product design and development by semiconductor or FPD manufacturers, and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional taxes could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's tax filings are subjected to audit by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it does business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or through the courts. Currently, the Company believes there are no outstanding assessments whose resolution would result in a material adverse financial result. However, the Company cannot offer assurances that unasserted or potential future assessments would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's business could be adversely impacted by global or regional catastrophic events.\nThe Company's business could be adversely affected by terrorist acts, major natural disasters, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, or the outbreak or escalation of wars, especially in the Asian markets, where the Company generates a significant portion of its sales, and in Japan where it purchases raw materials and capital equipment. Such events in the geographic regions in which the Company does business, including escalations of political tensions and military operations within the Korean Peninsula, where a major portion of the Company's foreign operations are located, could have material adverse impacts on its sales volume, cost of raw materials, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nTechnology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, store, and protect electronic information. For example, a significant portion of the communications between the Company\u2019s personnel, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. Information technology systems of the Company may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond its control including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. The Company has technology and information security processes and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities. However, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that its operations will not be disrupted, should such an event occur.\nServicing the Company's debt requires a significant amount of cash, and the Company may not have sufficient cash flows from its operations to pay its indebtedness.\nThe Company's ability to make scheduled payments of debt principal and interest or to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond the Company's control. The Company's business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to both service its debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If the Company is unable to generate such cash flows, it may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. The Company's ability to refinance its indebtedness would depend upon the conditions in the capital markets and the Company's financial condition at such time. The Company may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on its debt obligations.", "PERMNO": 11154, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PLAB"}
