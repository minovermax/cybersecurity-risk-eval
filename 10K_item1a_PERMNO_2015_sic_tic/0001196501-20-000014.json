Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to significant risks, including the risks and uncertainties described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this 2019 Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in a material way.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur ability to expand our business will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy.\nThe size and scope of our business operations have expanded over the past several years, and we currently intend to continue our growth and expansion into new healthcare areas and markets, however, our growth and expansion strategy carries costs and risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely affect our business. Our future growth will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully execute our business plans, which includes penetrating new markets, cross-selling our solutions to new and existing customers, broadening and deepening our customer relationships, our brand identity and our talent pool, identifying and executing future acquisitions, investments and strategic relationships, and increasing the speed, quality, capacity and scale at which we deliver our services across emerging and more established markets, all while remaining competitive. We must also be flexible and responsive to customers\u2019 needs and changes in the political, economic and regulatory environment in which we operate. The greater size and complexity of our expanding business may put additional strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and can make optimal resource allocation more difficult to determine. It is possible that we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our growth. A failure to anticipate or properly address the demands and challenges that our continued growth and diversification may have on our resources and existing infrastructure may result in unanticipated costs and inefficiencies that could negatively impact our ability to execute on our business plans and growth goals, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to innovate and develop new or enhanced solutions and services, or if these solutions and services are not adopted by our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPart of our growth strategy depends on our ability to respond to the evolving healthcare landscape with new and enhanced solutions and services that our existing and potential customers are willing to adopt. The development, marketing and implementation of these solutions and services may require that we make substantial financial and resource investments. We face risks that our new or modified offerings may not be responsive to customer preferences or industry changes, appropriately timed with market opportunity or effectively brought to market, and that the solution and service development initiatives that we prioritize may not yield the gains that we anticipate, if any. If we are unable to predict market preferences or healthcare industry changes, or if we are unable to develop or adapt solutions and services that are responsive to existing and potential customers\u2019 needs, we may fail to expand our business, which could constrain our future revenue growth and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur acquisition and investment strategy may subject us to considerable business and financial risk.\nTo achieve our strategic goals, we have made a significant number of acquisitions and investments in businesses that have expanded our service offerings, including our population health management solutions, and broadened our customer base and our market and geographic presence. We intend to pursue future acquisitions, investments and strategic relationships that will continue to complement and grow our business lines and to engage periodically in discussions regarding such transactions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to identify\nsuitable candidates for potential acquisitions, investments and strategic relationships, and to consummate additional transactions that will be advantageous to us and successfully integrate acquired businesses, solutions, services, technologies or employees. Future and potential business acquisitions, investments and strategic relationships involve a number of risk factors that could affect our operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aadiversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u25aaour ability to successfully and timely integrate operational, accounting and technology functions, policies, processes, systems and controls, and to implement these functions, policies, processes, systems and controls, without incurring substantial expenses, delays, difficulties or other issues;\n\u25aaour ability to integrate personnel and human resource systems as well as the corporate cultures;\n\u25aacontinued coordination and cooperation with sellers pursuant to transition services agreements and with strategic partners;\n\u25aaour ability to retain or replace key personnel and to manage a geographically dispersed workforce;\n\u25aaour ability to maintain relationships with customers and suppliers of acquired businesses and operations;\n\u25aaour ability to expand and further develop acquired businesses and operations and strategic relationships;\n\u25aaour ability to combine service offerings, and to cross-sell our solutions and acquired solutions to our respective customers;\n\u25aacustomer dissatisfaction or performance problems with acquired businesses, operations, solutions or services or strategic partners;\n\u25aaour ability to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid potential conflicts of interest in markets that we serve;\n\u25aathe misuse of intellectual property by personnel of acquired businesses and operations and strategic partners;\n\u25aaour ability to successfully enter into unfamiliar markets or manage new business lines;\n\u25aacompliance challenges related to new regulatory requirements or changes in international laws and regulations, such as those pertaining to data privacy, employment matters and taxation;\n\u25aaassumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities and/or negative publicity related to prior acts by acquired businesses and operations and strategic partners;\n\u25aaexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with acquired businesses and operations and strategic partners, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or third parties;\n\u25aause of substantial portions of available cash or the risk of becoming significantly leveraged as a result of incurring debt to finance an acquisition, investment or strategic relationship;\n\u25aathe failure of acquired businesses, operations, solutions or services to perform as expected or meet financial projections, which could negatively impact earnings or contingent consideration;\n\u25aaour lack of control and sole decision-making authority with respect to the operations of investments and strategic partners, potential changes in the economic or business interests, goals, financial condition or reputation of our strategic partners or potential changes in control of our strategic partners, and potential adverse changes in our relationships with our strategic partners;\n\u25aapotential impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets or potential impairment of strategic investments made by us; and\n\u25aapotential dilution to our earnings per share.\nIn addition, we periodically evaluate, and may engage in, the future disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve a number of risks, including separation of operations, services or personnel, diversion of management\u2019s attention, significant costs and expenses, disruption of the Company\u2019s business, potential loss of key employees, customer relationships or cash flow, and continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, including through indemnification or other financial obligations. If we fail to adequately address these risks, or any of the foregoing factors, or to successfully integrate the businesses, operations, solutions or services that we acquire, we may not realize cost efficiencies, synergies or other benefits that we anticipated from the divestiture of assets and businesses or when selecting our acquisition, investment or strategic relationship candidates, and our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition for our solutions and services and we expect competition to increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets for payment accuracy and population health management solutions are intensely competitive, driven by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, customer demands to become more cost-effective and efficient, and increased consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. Our competitors range in size from large, diversified national companies (some of which have emerged as a result of industry consolidation), to small, specialized firms. Some of our competitors may include current or former subcontractors or teaming partners seeking to establish direct relationships with our customers and provide similar services as the prime contractor, as well as current and prospective customers that elect to perform recovery and cost avoidance functions in-house or to develop in-house capacities for solutions and services that we provide or seek to provide. For example, certain state customers have combined or \u201cbundled\u201d TPL services under large-scale IT procurements, as they shift to implementing modular Medicaid Enterprise Systems. As part of this modular approach, they may select a new or less experienced vendor to provide the TPL module based on preferred relationships or favorable pricing. Consolidation among vendors and healthcare providers, as well as the merging of some of our competitors or formation of business alliances with other competitors, have contributed to the increasingly competitive environment. In addition, companies that have invested in proprietary technology different from our own service offerings, such as front-end analytics or consumer-centric capabilities, have emerged as new competitors due to the rapidly evolving healthcare IT landscape. There is also increasing sophistication in the solutions and services that our competitors are developing that may become more efficient or appealing to our customers and their member populations, or may offer greater interoperability. In order to remain competitive, we may need to quickly develop and market new and enhanced solutions and services responsive to emerging technologies and changes in the healthcare industry, which may require that we make substantial financial and resource investments.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, and others have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do in certain markets. They may be able to (i) offer lower prices or negotiate fee reductions on our current solutions and services, (ii) respond more quickly than we can to new and emerging technologies and changing customer requirements, (iii) devote greater resources to the sale and promotion of their products and the development and implementation of new and improved systems, solutions and services for customers that we serve, and (iv) pursue various acquisitions that allow them to rapidly amass a wide array of capabilities. We may be forced to lower our pricing, unexpectedly increase or enhance our technological or data capabilities, or modify our solution or service offerings. Additionally, competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or vendors. Notwithstanding any changes we make in response to increased competition, the demand for our solutions and services may still decrease as a result of increased competition. A failure to be responsive to our existing and potential customers\u2019 needs or the changing industry landscape could hinder our ability to maintain or expand our customer base, hire and retain new employees, pursue new business opportunities, complete future acquisitions, investments and strategic relationships and operate our business effectively. Any inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nYou will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance because they are subject to significant fluctuation which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nOur revenue and operating results may fail to match our past or projected performance and could vary significantly from period-to- period as a result of a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. We have experienced fluctuations in our revenue and operating results in the past and they may vary in the future for reasons that include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aafluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle;\n\u25aathe length of contract and implementation periods;\n\u25aathe commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u25aacontract costs and expenses, which may be incurred in periods prior to revenue being recognized;\n\u25aathe timing of period revenue recovery projects and third party payers\u2019 claim adjudication;\n\u25aathe billing and budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u25aathe timing of government procurement activities, including when contract awards are announced and the time required to resolve bid protests;\n\u25aacontract renewal discussions, which may result in delayed payments for services already performed;\n\u25aachanges in the pricing structure or other significant terms in our contracts, or the scope of services we perform;\n\u25aatechnological and operational issues affecting our customers, including delays in payment receipt for previously recognized revenue due to certain customers' delayed processing of our findings through their systems, and restrictions on our ability to use or access certain data or a lack of integrity or quality in the data or information we receive from certain data sources;\n\u25aaadjustments to age/quality of receivables and accruals as a result of factors such as delays involving contract limitations or changes, customer decisions to delay, avoid or refuse to make payments for our properly provided services, subcontractor performance deficiencies or managerial decisions not to pursue identified claim revenue from customers;\n\u25aathe impact of service disruptions or delays in the systems or operations of subcontractors, partners, vendors and other third party providers on which we rely on to deliver a single-source solution or service to our customers;\n\u25aathe timing of expenses related to the development, acquisition, or divestiture of technologies or businesses and the timing of expenses related to strategic investments, dispositions and relationships;\n\u25aachanges in applicable laws;\n\u25aachanges in accounting policies or guidelines; and\n\u25aaregulatory changes or general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payers.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which future variations could occur due to these or other factors. In addition, occasionally our state and federal customers are requested by third party payers to refund payments that we previously recovered for our customers. If our state and federal customers choose to refund money in response to these requests, regardless of whether an error actually occurred in connection with the payments, we may also be required to return contingent revenue which we were previously paid associated with such refunded payment. Consequently, our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation for any particular quarter, fiscal year, or other period, and may not be indicative of future periods. Our business is also subject to seasonal patterns resulting from increased efforts at year-end by certain customers to generate additional savings, complete compliance obligations and close gaps in care. However, taken as a whole, we do not consider our operations to be seasonal to any material degree. Due to all of these factors, our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to significant fluctuation, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nWe face challenges associated with forecasting the revenue under our contracts, and any failure to accurately forecast such revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, or the costs and timing for implementing and completing our contracts. For a majority of our customer contracts, the payment of our fee is contingent upon the recoveries received by our customers. We also have cost-plus or time-and-materials based contracts with the federal government where our revenue is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned. Our ability to earn a profit on these contracts requires that we accurately estimate the costs involved with these contracts and assess the probability of achieving certain outcomes or milestones within the contracted time period. In addition, we cannot predict with certainty the costs or the period in which implementation or contracts may be completed when we introduce new solutions into the marketplace. For our coordination of benefits and\npayment integrity services, we may face a long implementation period with a new customer or a new contract with an existing customer, making it difficult to reliably forecast revenue under those contracts. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, or if we encounter increased or unexpected costs, delays, failures, liabilities or risks, including those outside of our control, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. Although we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed price and cost-plus contracts where applicable, as required under U.S. GAAP, our contract loss provisions may not be adequate to cover all actual future losses.\nSystem interruptions or failures could expose us to liability and harm our business.\nOur data and operation centers are essential to our business and our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our information systems. We attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment; however, the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate in every case. Despite systems redundancy and security measures, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other sources:\n\u25aapower loss, transmission cable cuts and telecommunications failures;\n\u25aafires, floods, earthquakes, extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters;\n\u25aasoftware or hardware malfunctions, failures or defects;\n\u25aaoperator error;\n\u25aacyber-attacks, physical break-ins, sabotage or intentional acts of vandalism; and\n\u25aaother events beyond our control, such as medical epidemics or pandemics, war, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events.\nIn addition, while there are backup systems in many of our facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services supplied by third party IT vendors may delay or disrupt the delivery or performance of the services we provide for our customers. We also utilize third-party cloud service providers to help us efficiently scale certain cloud-based solutions. If we or our cloud service providers encounter a lengthy business interruption, or in the event our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are not effective, or our applicable insurance coverage is denied or not sufficient to compensate for all the liability on a timely basis, we could suffer operational, communication and service disruptions, disputes with customers and third parties, civil or criminal penalties, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses, loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate financial and other reports, damage to our reputation or customer relationships or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur systems and networks and those of third parties on which we rely may be subject to cyber security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information and harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks, as well as on those of third-party providers, to process, transmit, maintain, store and host the confidential, proprietary and sensitive information and data we receive from our customers and other data suppliers, including private insurance plans and financial institutions. Some of the data we process, access, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our international business operations. In addition, subcontractors, teaming partners or other third-party vendors may receive or utilize this information on our behalf in support of the services we perform for our customers. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have devoted and continue to devote significant resources to implement security and privacy programs and controls, train our workforce and augment our security measures with new and enhanced technologies and processes, among other investments. Despite our security management efforts, our information technology and infrastructure, and those of third parties on which we rely, may continue to be vulnerable to computer hacking or phishing efforts, acts of vandalism or theft, introduction of malware, computer viruses, other malicious codes or other cyber-attacks, employee or insider malfeasance and misfeasance issues, fraud, human error, catastrophes, or unforeseen events. We may be unable to\nimplement adequate preventive measures to protect against such compromises in the future or to effectively adapt our security measures to evolving security risks. As a result, our technology systems, including our data and our customers\u2019 data, could be accessed improperly, made unavailable, improperly modified, corrupted or otherwise breached or compromised, or we could suffer system disruptions, shutdowns and denials of service. Similarly, we could be materially adversely affected by the loss of proprietary, trade secret or confidential technical and financial data if our internal networks are compromised. The occurrence of any of these events could harm the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures, lead to reputational damage or the loss of our customers\u2019 confidence in our solutions, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to terminate or not renew their existing contracts with us, or deter them from using our solutions or services in the future, all of which could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses and expose us to potential liability under privacy, security or other applicable laws and regulations, including losses and costs associated with any resulting fraud. We also may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties imposed by government regulatory agencies, and damages and other substantial costs associated with litigation, indemnification and contractual obligations, increased cybersecurity insurance premiums, and additional remediation efforts, such as credit monitoring, call center services or other corrective plans. We may be forced to spend significant time and resources investigating the cause of the breach, repairing system damage, remediating vulnerabilities in our security procedures, disseminating breach notifications, enhancing cyber security protection controls and measures, and deploying additional security personnel and protection technologies, all of which could increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny failure to maintain effective information processing systems and the integrity of the data in, and operations of, those systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to conduct our operations and accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems and the processes performed by those systems. As a result of the services we provide, we process a number of complex transactions that require us to access, store, retrieve, manipulate, manage and transmit the information and data of our customers\u2019 and external third parties, as well as our own data. Although we have invested a great deal of time and resources in developing systems, processes and controls that protect the integrity of the data, such measures cannot provide absolute security. It is possible that failures or errors in hardware and software, including those in third-party technology, or technical deficiencies in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the data that we collect, utilize or disseminate to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. In addition, these information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs, satisfy customer requests and handle our expansion and growth. Despite our testing and quality control measures, we cannot be certain that errors or system deficiencies will be found and that remediation can be done in a timeframe that is acceptable to our customers, or that customer relationships will not be impaired by the occurrence of errors or the need for remediation. In addition, implementation of upgrades and enhancements may cost more, take longer or require more testing than originally expected. As we continue to expand our business, we face additional challenges in implementing adequate internal control over financial reporting. Situations may also arise in which the accuracy of our data analysis or the content and quality of our work product is central to the disposition of claims, controversies or litigation between our customers and third parties that would require us to allocate significant resources to fulfilling our contractual obligations to provide our customers with full and complete access to records, analysis and back-up documentation of our work. Assuring our capacity to fulfill these obligations as well as actually fulfilling them could impose significant burdens on our infrastructure for data storage, maintenance and processing, and require us to incur increased costs to supplement our personnel, data storage and computing resources, which could materially and negatively impact other business operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, information, processes, know-how, and other intellectual property, or become subject to third party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, the value of our solutions and services may be diminished and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success as a company depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. Our expanding operations and efforts to develop new solutions and services also make protection of our intellectual property more critical. We seek to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and other third parties, as well as through the terms of our agreements with customers and vendors, and other security measures. However, the steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our proprietary information. For example, we may not always be successful at obtaining government registrations for our patents, trademarks, or copyrights that we seek to register. Even if we are successful, the existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection, and our property rights in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to do business may not receive the same degree of protection or enforceability as those in the United States. Third parties may also attempt to misuse our company name or trademarks to engage in improper or illegal conduct such as cyber-squatting or other cybercrimes using our marks, and we may not always be successful at quickly obtaining relief from agencies tasked with enforcing parties\u2019 rights, or stopping such conduct before harm to third parties occurs. Similarly, misappropriation of our other intellectual property by third parties, or any disclosure or dissemination of our confidential and proprietary trade secrets, business intelligence, queries, algorithms and other similar information by any means, could undermine any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from that intellectual property. For example, our current or former employees, consultants or other third parties may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets, know-how or other confidential and proprietary information to competitors. Competitors have also attempted to use state and/or federal open records laws (such as the federal Freedom of Information Act and analogous state laws) to obtain our proposal responses and other documents we provide to our government customers. We cannot be certain that our efforts to protect the confidential and proprietary trade secret information or intellectual property in these proposals or other documents will always be successful, due to the many factors underlying the various state and federal decisions to release information in response to open records requests (even in spite of our objections and efforts to protect such information). Additionally, certain of our service or solutions offerings from our recent acquisitions may incorporate open source software that are licensed under various public domain licenses or without warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections. Although we carefully monitor and manage our use of open source software to avoid uses that would require us to disclose proprietary source code or violate applicable open source licenses, if we engage in such uses inadvertently, we may be required to take remedial action or release certain of our proprietary source code. Moreover, there remains the possibility that others will independently develop competing technologies that may be equivalent or superior to ours. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties or our employees, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and make us less competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property, using their intellectual property inconsistent with or without the appropriate license terms, or assert other legal challenges to our intellectual property. Our exposure to these risks may further increase after we acquire a business or technology because third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology. Any of these situations could cause us to expend significant time and resources and to incur substantial costs associated with settlements, litigation or other legal proceedings that may be necessary to defend ourselves or to enforce our intellectual property rights, in which we may not ultimately prevail, and could result in our being prevented from furnishing certain solutions and services. We may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them, which could be costly.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to maintain a high level of customer retention, if our customers elect to reduce the scope of our contracts or terminate them before their scheduled expiration dates or if we fail to meet performance standards under our customer contracts.\nWe historically have derived and expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of large customers at the federal and state level. Our contracts with these customers are subject to periodic\nrenewal and some permit them to terminate their contracts on short notice, with or without cause. If a customer is dissatisfied with the quality or pricing of our work or if we fail to meet performance standards under our contracts, or if our solutions, technical infrastructure or services do not comply with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements, the customer might seek to reduce the scope of the services we perform or prematurely terminate its agreements with us, or we could incur additional costs that may impair the profitability of a contract and damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer, or other current or prospective customers. For example, some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures, which if triggered, could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also may be required to disclose such liquidated damages or other financial penalties assessed against us in connection with future bids for services with other customers.\nIn addition, our government and commercial healthcare customers are subject to financial pressures or pressure from stakeholders that may cause them to terminate contracts for our services that they regard as non-essential or have the ability to develop or perform in-house. They could also redefine or reduce the scope of our contracts by, for example, significantly reducing the volume of data that we are permitted to audit, or decide to renew our contracts at lower performance fee levels. Despite our right to prompt and full payment under the terms of our contracts, we could face challenges in obtaining timely or full payments for our properly provided services from our customers. If there is a substantial reduction in the scope of our services under, or a termination of, any of our key contracts with our major customers, or if we are exposed to significant costs, liabilities or negative publicity, our ability to compete for new contracts with current or prospective customer could be damaged and our business, financial condition, reputation, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on many different entities to supply information, and any inability to successfully manage our relationships with a number of these suppliers may harm the quality and availability of our solutions and services.\nWe obtain the data used in our solutions and services from many sources, including commercial health insurance plans, financial institutions, managed care organizations, government entities and non-government entities. From time to time, challenges arise in managing and maintaining our relationships with data sources that are not our customers and that furnish information to us pursuant to a combination of voluntary cooperation and legal obligations under laws and regulations that are often subject to differing interpretations. If a number of our information sources become unable or unwilling to provide us with certain data under terms and conditions of receipt, processing or use that are acceptable to us and our customers, or if laws and regulations for use and protection of this data changes in a way that could disincentivize our suppliers, or impose unacceptable or unreasonable conditions, costs, or risks on us, we may not be able to obtain new or favorable agreements with alternative data suppliers. In addition, our ability to normalize and fully utilize the information we receive from various data sources to enhance and improve current services for our customers is an important component of our growth strategy. Although we believe that we have the legal and contractual rights necessary to normalize and use the data we have obtained from these sources for potential or contemplated solution and service offerings, we cannot provide assurance that these entities will permit the use of their data for these purposes. If we lose a number of our data sources or our access to their data, and fail to identify and reach the requisite agreements with suitable alternative suppliers or to successfully integrate their data into our solutions and services, or if there is a lack of accuracy or integrity in the data that current or future suppliers provide, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, reduced quality of our solutions and services, or performance penalties under our customer contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may rely on subcontractors and other third party providers to provide customers with a single-source solution or service or we may serve as a subcontractor to a third party prime contractor. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn some areas of our business, we may engage subcontractors, teaming partners, vendors or other third party providers to provide our customers with a single-source solution for a broader range of service needs. These third parties include software vendors, utility and network providers, cloud service providers, contingent workers and other information technology service providers and solution partners. Our ability to deliver and implement solutions and serve our customers effectively depends on these third parties meeting our service standards in both timeliness and quality, and in certain instances, on our ability to obtain customer approval for the use of these third party subcontractors. While we believe that we perform appropriate due diligence on these third parties and take adequate measures to ensure that they comply with the appropriate laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that they will comply with the terms set forth in their agreements with us. Performance deficiencies or misconduct by subcontractors, teaming partners, vendors or other third party providers may be perceived as inadequacies in our solutions or services or cause us to fail to fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our customer relationships and reputation, result in termination of customer contracts, and subject us to disputes with our customers. In addition, if our third party service providers terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or offer their products to us in the future on less advantageous terms, we may not be able to perform or deliver solutions or services for existing customers as expected.\nSimilarly, we are and may in the future be engaged as a subcontractor to a third party prime contractor which contracts directly with the customer. Subcontracting arrangements where we are not the prime contractor pose unique risks to us because we do not have control over the customer relationship, and our ability to generate revenue under such subcontracts is dependent on the prime contractor, its performance and relationship with the customer, and its relationship with us. We cannot be certain that the prime contractor will provide adequate and timely services to the customer, comply with the terms of its prime contract with the customer or its subcontract agreement with us, or that it will construe its contractual rights and obligations in a reasonable way, act appropriately in dealing with us or customers, and remain in compliance with the relevant laws, rules or regulations. Any failure of the prime contractor to adequately perform its obligations under the prime contract or to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation and subject us to a dispute with the prime contractor or the customer. In the event a prime contract is terminated, whether for non-performance by the prime contractor or otherwise, our subcontract will similarly terminate, and the resulting contract loss could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe obtain a portion of our business through competitive bidding in response to government requests for proposals. Reprocurements and future contracts may not be awarded through this process on the same level or our contract awards may be challenged by interested parties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn order to market our solutions and compete for contracts with existing and potential state and federal customers, we are often required to respond to government-issued RFPs. These responses typically require us to assemble and submit a large volume of information within a rigid timetable, and to accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing the proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the likely terms of proposals submitted by our competitors. We may also be required to disclose the occurrence of certain negative events suffered by our business, such as customer disputes, a government inquiry or audit, or an adverse judgment or settlement in litigation or a legal proceeding, which could impair our ability to win the contract at issue or have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry.\nEven if we win these contracts, we may fail to secure favorable contract terms and conditions, or a government\u2019s determination to award us the contract may be challenged by an interested party. Under the state and federal laws and regulations governing procurements of goods and services, challenges and award protests may be filed even if there are no valid legal grounds on which to base the protest. The filing of such challenges could potentially delay the start or implementation of the contract if the government agency determines to withhold a contract award or suspend contract performance while the protest is being considered, or to take corrective action on its own, such as soliciting new bids or\nterminating the contract award or current procurement. In the event of irregularities that we perceive or learn of in the award or bidding process, we also may be forced to file protests in response to RFP awards to other bidders. Resolution of a protest, even in our favor, could force us to expend considerable funds in disputing the potential award or to incur additional expenses to maintain our ability to timely start implementation, which may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to win reprocurements or protests of particular contracts, we may be precluded from entering certain customer markets for the term of the contract awarded to another party. Any failure to continue to obtain contracts in response to government RFPs, to design proposals that result in profitable contracts, to win new contracts or re-procure current contracts after they expire or to prevail in protests or challenges of contract awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse judgments or settlements in legal proceedings could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject and may be a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which may include, but are not limited to, those related to, claims brought by our customers in connection with billing and contractual disputes, subcontracts and teaming agreements, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, individual or class action claims in relation to the services we provide, claims relating to pending, terminated or completed acquisitions or dispositions, or relating to investments or strategic relationships, adversary proceedings arising from customer bankruptcies, employment of our workforce and immigration requirements or compliance with any of a wide array of statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business, both domestically and internationally. We may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. There is a risk that we will not be successful or otherwise be able to satisfactorily resolve any pending or future litigation. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of currently pending legal matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions, and differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Resolution may also require that HMS accept some amount of loss or liability in order to avoid customer abrasion, negative marketplace perceptions and other disadvantageous results. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings (possibly resulting in changes in established reserves), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to deliver our solutions and perform services efficiently if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur successful delivery of solutions and services and ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is dependent on our ability to identify, recruit, employ, train and retain skilled personnel. The success of recruitment and retention strategies depend on a number of factors, including the competitive demands for employees having the skills we need, the level of compensation required to hire and retain such employees and immigration requirements that may affect our ability to sponsor employees for employment-based visas. Customers or competitors may seek to hire away qualified and seasoned employees, which could reduce our ability to innovate and operate effectively. We may not be able to recruit or maintain the personnel necessary to efficiently operate and support our business in the future, and even if our recruitment and retention strategies are successful, our labor costs may increase significantly. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis without significantly increasing our labor costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continued service of members of our management team.\nOur ability to execute on our business plans and future success requires that we attract, develop, motivate and retain experienced and innovative executive officers and senior leaders who have successfully managed, designed, implemented and led government services programs or information technology initiatives, or have relevant experience in other healthcare sectors, including data management and analytics. These individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in our industry. The loss of services of one or more members of our management team could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent we lose an executive officer or senior leader, we may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion or replacement of these individuals and the transition of leadership and critical knowledge.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance under our Credit Agreement was $240 million. Our Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $500 million and is secured, subject to certain customary carve-outs and exceptions, by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that:\n\u25aawe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u25aaour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures;\n\u25aaour indebtedness may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are and will be at variable interest rates;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, strategic relationships and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited;\n\u25aaour indebtedness and leverage may prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our business; and\n\u25aaour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are also required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. The Credit Agreement also contains (i) certain affirmative covenants that impose certain reporting and/or performance obligations on us and our restricted subsidiaries, (ii) certain negative covenants that generally limit, subject to various exceptions, us and our restricted subsidiaries from taking certain actions, including, without limitation, incurring indebtedness, creating liens, engaging in mergers and consolidations, disposing of certain assets or property, making certain investments and acquisitions, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, swap agreements or sale-leasebacks, making certain restricted payments, including dividends and share repurchases, changing our fiscal year or the lines of business that we or our restricted subsidiaries conduct to a material extent, and prepaying certain junior indebtedness, (iii) financial covenants consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, and (iv) customary events of default for financings of this type.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement may be declared due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, which includes, without limitation: non-payment of principal or reimbursement obligations when due; non-payment of interest, fees and other amounts for a period of five business days after the due date; material inaccuracies of representations and warranties; failure to perform or observe covenants, conditions or agreements (subject to any applicable grace periods); cross-defaults of certain indebtedness; inability to pay debts;\ncertain acts of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain ERISA events; failure to pay certain material judgments; and a change of control as defined in the Credit Agreement. If not cured, an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, and would give our lenders the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which would require us to, among other things, seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets, and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding credit facility depends upon our future performance and our ability to generate cash flows. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, certain of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. Our Credit Agreement includes language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary; however, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021, or whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. A transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate on certain borrowings could have a material adverse effect on the availability of financing and on our financing costs.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, may materially adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a U.S.-based company subject to taxation in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As we continue to expand our business outside of the United States, we may become subject to additional tax laws and regulations, including those that could increase our exposure to additional tax liabilities, such as foreign tax laws, and laws relating to U.S. taxes on foreign operations. Our future effective tax rates could be materially affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates of jurisdictions in which we do business, changes in relevant tax and accounting rules, regulations and interpretations, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in geographic sales mix. For example, in December 2017, Congress enacted the 2017 Tax Act which, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate, modified limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, placed new limitations on interest deductions, repealed the Section 199 Deduction and certain capital investment deductions, and shifted U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system. Any unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result. The final determination of any of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses associated with workers\u2019 compensation claims, general business liabilities, property damage and employee health care benefits. We have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy for our health plans to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs and maintain insurance coverage with varying limits and retention amounts to help limit exposure to certain other risks. Insurance reserves are established for our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis,\nwhich is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, economic conditions and management judgments about the present and expected level of cost per claim. This determination is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our prior growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying our reserves could result in materially different amounts of expense reported under these programs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations expose us to a number of business and financial risks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have expanded our business to include operations, investments, strategic relationships and personnel outside of the United States. Our international operations expose us to a number of business and financial risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaunfavorable foreign currency exchange rates or fluctuations;\n\u25aadifficulties and increased costs involved in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25aaseasonal reductions in business activity;\n\u25aaour ability to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25aalegal uncertainties inherent in transnational operations such as export and import regulations, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u25aathe impact of foreign laws, regulations and trade customs;\n\u25aaU.S. and foreign taxation issues;\n\u25aaincreased costs of marketing to and servicing international clients;\n\u25aageneral political and economic trends, including the potential impact of political unrest, terrorist attacks or international hostilities; and\n\u25aalegal compliance costs and risks associated with international operations, including heightened risks with respect to certain laws, including without limitation, healthcare and other data privacy laws, FCPA and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our business.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. It is possible that accounting standards we are required to adopt may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems. Changes in accounting standards could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by changes in the U.S. healthcare environment or in laws relating to healthcare programs and policies, particularly as they relate to the ACA and the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe healthcare industry in which we operate is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that directly affect the practices and operations of federal, state and commercial healthcare organizations in the United\nStates. When the ACA was passed, its emphasis on program integrity, cost containment and expansion of Medicaid created new opportunities to grow our business and our service offerings. However, certain provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented and the regulatory framework of the ACA and other healthcare reforms continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Since its adoption into law in 2010, there have been continued efforts by Congress to amend, repeal or replace all or part of the ACA. Congress has introduced several other bills to delay, defund or repeal implementation or amend significant provisions of the ACA, though none of these other bills have passed the House and Senate.\nIn addition to these legislative proposals, the current presidential administration has taken several steps to limit the functionality of the ACA and to undermine or delay the implementation of the ACA. During 2017, the President signed two executive orders and other directives designed to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Although legislative attempts to completely repeal the ACA have been unsuccessful to date, there have been a number of attempts to amend, repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA through other legislative actions and legal challenges. For example, in December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law, which, among other things, repealed the penalty under the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d introduced by the ACA. In February 2018, a number of states filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that the ACA was unconstitutional in light of the repeal of the penalties associated with the individual mandate. In December 2018, the district court issued a ruling that the mandate was no longer permissible under Congress\u2019s taxing power and was thus unconstitutional and inseverable from the ACA. As such, the court further found that the remaining provisions of the ACA were also deemed to be invalid. The district court\u2019s ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed part of the lower court\u2019s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA were nonetheless valid. On January 3, 2020, the attorney generals of 20 states and the District of Columbia filed a petition requesting the Supreme Court to take up the case with an expedited review, which was denied. Although, a stay and partial final judgment has been issued pending appeals, ensuring that the ACA remains operational in all respects, we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation that has been filed relating to the constitutionality of the ACA. As such, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the continued implementation of the ACA and what similar healthcare reform measures or other changes might be enacted at the federal and/or state level.\nThere have also been a number of proposed and adopted legislative initiatives and healthcare reform proposals from the federal and state governments in response to budgetary or deficit considerations. These include (i) block grants and other proposals that would fundamentally change the financial structure of the Medicaid program (currently funded jointly by the states and the U.S. Federal Government), which could result in early termination, reduced scopes or non-renewal of our contracts with certain state government customers, and (ii) changes at the federal level that would reduce reimbursement rates to states, establish new payment models, further limit the Medicare RAC program, or otherwise change the operating environment for our customers and transform the government\u2019s involvement in healthcare. Future healthcare legislation could also have a significant impact on our business. Due to uncertainties regarding the outcome of future healthcare reform initiatives, and their enactment and implementation, we cannot predict which, if any, of the future reform proposals will be adopted or the effect such adoption may have on us.\nAnother variable that impacts our business will be how state programs, commercial health plans, private employers and other healthcare payers will respond to changes during this continued period of uncertainty surrounding the ACA. These organizations may react to such changed circumstances and financial pressures by taking actions to ramp up, curtail or defer their retention of cost containment providers like us, which could impact the demand for our solutions and services and our ability to increase or maintain sales of our existing solutions and services. While certain changes may present new opportunities to us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to adapt our solutions and services to meet changing requirements or expand service delivery into new areas, or if the demand for our solutions and services is reduced as a result of future legislative changes affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or efforts to\nwaive, modify or otherwise change or invalidate the ACA. Although we will continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible invalidation or repeal and replacement may have on our business, it is difficult to predict the full impact and influence that the ACA and the varying healthcare reform measures may have on the U.S. healthcare industry or policy, and any resulting changes may take time to unfold.\nHealthcare spending fluctuations, simplification of the healthcare payment process or other aspects of the healthcare financing system, budgetary pressures and/or programmatic changes diminishing the scope of program benefits, or limiting payment integrity initiatives, could reduce the need for and the price of our solutions and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur projections and expectations are premised, in part, upon consistent growth rates in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and government spending on these programs, and the impact on the current healthcare financing system overall and need for our solutions and services within that existing framework. Our continued success as a company is based in large part on offering solutions and services that improve the ability of our customers to identify and recover revenue that would otherwise be lost often as a result of procedural inefficiencies and complexities in the healthcare delivery and payment system. However, the need for our solutions and services, the price customers are willing to pay for them and the scope and profitability of our contracts could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaa lower than projected growth in Medicare and Medicaid program enrollment and expenditures;\n\u25aachanges in the level of federal government spending due to budgetary or deficit considerations, including the continuance of existing programs, as well as budgetary pressures that may drive changes at the state level;\n\u25aaunanticipated reductions in the scope of healthcare program benefits (such as, for example, state decisions to eliminate coverage of optional Medicaid populations or services or shifting lives into managed care plans);\n\u25aathe transition of healthcare beneficiaries from fee-for-service plans to value-based care and other alternative risk models;\n\u25aamodifications in provider billing behavior and habits, often in response to the success of our solutions and services or to changes that reduce healthcare spending;\n\u25aathe adoption of healthcare plans with significantly higher deductibles or other consumer healthcare cost-sharing;\n\u25aacustomer improvements and enhancements to their internal healthcare claims and billing processes;\n\u25aathe simplification of the healthcare benefit and payment system through legislative or regulatory changes at the federal or state level (for example, legislative changes impacting the scope of mandatory audits, including limits on the look-back period for review in areas where we conduct audits);\n\u25aalimits placed on ongoing program integrity initiatives, including the Medicare RAC program and state Medicaid RAC programs (for example, limitations or reductions in the amount of reviewable claims we audit, such as the modified ADR limits and sliding scale policy implemented by CMS for the current Medicare RAC contracts, which have a significant impact on the volumes of claims that Medicare RACs are permitted to review for inpatient providers and reduce their ability to identify overpayments and underpayments); and\n\u25aalegislative and regulatory healthcare reforms and developments, including the absence of near-term compliance deadlines effected by the ACA, the possible repeal or modification of the ACA, changes in rules and regulations that discourage participation in government-sponsored healthcare programs among certain key populations and other legislative actions to reduce program eligibility or services, or reform Medicaid spending.\nThe occurrence of any of these events, or other changes to the funding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs or limitations in the scope of program eligibility, benefits, initiatives and healthcare spending that materially reduce our revenue or profitability with such programs may have an adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to companies in our industry regarding individual privacy and information security could subject us to legal actions, fines and penalties and negatively impact our reputation and operations.\nAs a cost containment service provider, we often receive, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including PHI and personally identifiable information of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our customers, subcontractors, government agencies, data suppliers and other third parties from whom we obtain information. The use and disclosure of that information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels. In particular, we are subject to federal regulation under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and the Final Omnibus Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rule, as well as various U.S. state laws. HIPAA also imposes standards and requirements on our business associates (as defined under HIPAA). We are also obligated by our contractual requirements with customers, which may require that we comply with additional privacy regulations imposed upon certain types of customers, such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other laws. Additional legislation governing the acquisition, storage and transmission or other dissemination of health record information and other personal or sensitive information, including information outside the scope of HIPAA, continues to be proposed and come into force at the state level, such as the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. There are also numerous international privacy and security laws that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access, retention, storage, protection and confidentiality of personal information. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, introduced new data protection requirements, which relate to, among other things, the security, confidentiality and processing of personal data in the European Union. The transferring of personal information across international borders is also becoming increasingly complex. Additionally, several countries, including Australia, have established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers, and other countries, such as India, are considering requirements for data localization.\nIn addition, laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of personal information may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving interpretations and frequent change by legislation, regulatory issuances or industry standards. As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and these laws and regulations continue to expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our solutions and services, and may subject us to additional liabilities.\nEven though we take measures to comply with all applicable regulations and to ensure our business associates and subcontractors comply with these laws, regulations and rules, we have less than complete control over our business associates\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 actions and practices. We may be exposed to data breach risk if there is unauthorized access to one of our or our subcontractors\u2019 secure facilities, or to third-party enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services that we use, or from lost or stolen laptops or other portable media from current or former employee theft of data containing PHI, from computer hacking, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing or other cyber-attacks, from misdirected mailings containing PHI, or other forms of administrative or operational error. If we or our subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws; if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities and steal or misuse confidential information; if we erroneously use or disclose data in a way that is inconsistent with our granted rights; or if such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, we may suffer damage to our reputation, potential loss of existing customers and difficulty attracting new customers. We could also be exposed to, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, costs to provide notifications or remediation (such as credit monitoring) to affected individuals, fines or other penalties imposed by government regulatory agencies, or litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages or indemnification obligations related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including government and customer audits and investigations relating to our compliance with such laws and regulations applicable to companies in our industry, and a negative finding or other adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment. A significant portion of our business is regulated by the U.S. federal government and the states in which we operate. These laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect individual citizens, including government program beneficiaries, health plan members and their dependents. As such, the federal and state governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. Our contracts with U.S. government agencies are also subject to unique contractual provisions and performance requirements, and, on an ongoing basis, government and customer reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations, as well as specialized legal actions and enforcement proceedings. For example, because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to laws, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations, federal and state employment, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, federal and state prompt pay statutes, healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws, and similar legislation. We are also subject to the Federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, which permit government law enforcement agencies to institute suits against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek double or treble damages, penalties and assessments. In addition, private citizens, acting as whistleblowers, can sue on behalf of the government under the \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and similar statutory provisions in many states.\nAs we expand into new areas of the healthcare industry, we may develop new or enhanced solutions that may further expose us to requirements under additional statutes and legislative schemes that have previously not been relevant to our business, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and other banking and credit reporting statutes. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Eliza Corporation (\"Eliza\"), we became subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, state and federal audio and telephone recording laws, and other consumer laws and regulations as a result of the member engagement services that we perform. We also face heightened consumer communication protections as a result of the changing regulatory environment. Our increased involvement in population health services and penetration into new markets, such as ACOs, PBMs and commercial self-insured employers, could increase the likelihood and incidence of our being subjected to regulatory scrutiny or legal actions by third parties other than our customers, which may impose significant costs and strain on our resources.\nIn addition, the growth and continued expansion of our operations internationally subject us to additional and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, such as those relating to local and cross-border taxation, anticorruption, anti-competition, immigration, government compliance, securities regulation, internal and disclosure control obligations, import/export controls, trade restrictions, conflict of interest, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, and data privacy and protection, including cross-border data transfers. Our non-U.S. businesses and operations are also subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA. Our exposure for violating the FCPA and other anticorruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws may increase as we expand internationally and commence sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any changes in the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate or utilize third-party resources outside of the United States may increase our future legal and regulatory compliance burden and involve significant costs and resources, and the inadequate enforcement of such laws or regulations could affect our business and results of operations. Despite our efforts, we may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate at all times, and may be subject to sanctions, penalties or fines as a result.\nThese laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer and how we interact with customers, providers, other healthcare payers and the public. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, strategic partners or third parties with whom we do business, will not\nviolate our policies. If the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, significant monetary damages and fines, loss of required certifications or licenses, and suspension, disqualification or debarment from doing business with the government. Similarly, if our customers assert that we have failed to properly perform or comply with our contractual obligations, or if the carriers to which we send billings assert that we have failed to properly comply with applicable federal or state billing rules and regulations, we may be required to provide refunds or make payments to resolve such issues. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or if we receive an adverse review, audit or investigation from a government agency or customer related to our compliance with such laws or regulations or the terms of our government contracts, any resulting negative publicity, penalties or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, impair our ability to compete for new contracts or bid in response to RFPs in one or more jurisdictions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal and state governments may limit or prohibit outsourcing of certain programs or functions to private entities, refuse to grant consents or waivers necessary for them to perform such work, or impose other limitations on outsourcing that may obstruct cost-effective performance of our contracts.\nU.S. federal or state governments could limit or prohibit private contractors like us from operating or performing elements of certain government functions or programs. As a condition of receiving federal funding, state and local government agencies may be required to operate such programs with government employees. Under current U.S. law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the federal government must grant a consent and/or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver, the state or local government will be unable to outsource that function to a commercial entity. Such a situation could eliminate a contracting opportunity or reduce the value of an existing contract.\nSimilarly, the U.S. government may impose limitations or requirements on the outsourcing of work to offshore resources, which could make it more difficult for us to fulfill our contracts in a cost-effective manner. Certain areas of our operations use or involve vendor or subcontractor personnel located outside of the United States to supplement our workforce, who may (under carefully controlled circumstances) access certain PHI in the course of assisting us with various elements of the services we provide to our customers. The federal government and a number of states have proposed or passed laws or issued rules, regulations, and orders that would limit, restrict or wholly prohibit the use of offshore labor in performance of government contracts, or impose sanctions for the use of such resources. Some of our customers have already chosen to contractually limit or restrict our ability to use offshore personnel and systems. Intensified restrictions of this type or associated penalties could raise our costs of doing business, expose us to unexpected fines or penalties, increase the prices we must charge to customers to realize a profit and eliminate or significantly reduce the value of existing contracts or potential contract opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be precluded from bidding on or performing certain work due to work we currently perform, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious laws, regulations and administrative policies prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies in capacities that might be viewed to create an actual or perceived conflict of interest. In particular, CMS has stringent conflict of interest rules, which can limit our bidding for specific work for CMS, or for other contracts that might conflict, or be perceived by CMS to conflict, with contractual work for CMS. State governments and managed care organizations also have conflict of interest restrictions that could limit our ability to bid for certain work and impede our overall sales strategy. As we continue to expand and diversify our business operations, the likelihood that customers or potential customers will perceive conflicts of interest between our various subsidiaries, solutions, services, activities and customer relationships may increase. Such conflicts, whether real or perceived, could result in a loss of contracts or additional internal structural barriers that delay operational efficiency. We may also need to divest certain existing\nbusinesses or reorganize our current management and personnel structure, as well as our corporate organization and entity structure, in order to qualify for new contract awards or to appropriately mitigate conflicts and otherwise accommodate the increasing complexity of our business. Our failure to devote sufficient care, attention and resources to managing these adjustments may result in technical or administrative errors that could expose us to potential liability or adverse regulatory action. In addition, conflict of interest rules and standards change frequently, and are subject to varying interpretations and varying degrees and consistency of enforcement. We may not be successful in navigating these restrictions. If we are prevented from expanding our business or are unable to effectively implement our strategic initiatives due to real or perceived conflicts of interest, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and fluctuations in the price of our common stock may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and materially adversely affect our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate. During the 52-week period ended December 31, 2019, our common stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as high as $39.93 per share and as low as $26.53 per share. Our stock price fluctuates based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, which include the risk factors described above and those related to:\n\u25aaquarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25aachanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts about our future operating and stock price performance or in the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company;\n\u25aanews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the healthcare industry, including perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and our competitors;\n\u25aathe financial projections we publicly provide and any changes in or failure to meet those projections;\n\u25aafuture sales of shares of common stock in the public market by our executive officers or directors;\n\u25aaany changes in the number of our outstanding shares, including as a result of share repurchases;\n\u25aaactual or proposed changes in federal or state laws affecting the healthcare industry;\n\u25aachanges in accounting principles;\n\u25aathe public\u2019s response to our press releases, or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u25aasecurities class actions, shareholder lawsuits or other litigation; and\n\u25aamarket conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have not paid or declared cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and continued growth of our business and repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of holders of our common stock. In the event of issuance, preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it is possible that we will do so in the future. In addition, our bylaws currently require advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors and provide for Delaware as an exclusive forum for certain disputes with our shareholders, all of which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control.", "PERMNO": 78156, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "HMSY"}
