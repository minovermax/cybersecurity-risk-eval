{"cik": "1436425", "company": "HOME BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our business and our customers, employees and third-party service providers. The impacts on our business, operations, financial position and prospects have been and are expected to continue to be significant.\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. Business and consumer customers of the Bank experienced varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue over coming months and may adversely affect their ability to timely pay interest and principal on their loans and the value of the collateral securing their obligations. During 2021, restrictive measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals eased and the U.S. economy began to improve. With the recent outbreak of the Omicron variant, we may experience additional uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity, which may lead to the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses. Disruptions to our customers\u2019 businesses could also result in declines in, among other things, wealth management revenue. These new developments as a consequence of the pandemic may materially impact our business and the businesses of our customers and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results as the pandemic continues.\nOur branch locations are currently open and operating during normal business hours. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, we continue to take additional precautions within our branch locations, including enhanced cleaning procedures. We may take further actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward. For instance, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 does not yet appear to be contained and the continued outbreak of new variants of COVID-19 could affect significantly more households and businesses. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, the scale of distribution and public acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of such vaccines in stemming or stopping the spread of COVID-19. The adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nThere are increased risks involved with commercial real estate, including multi-family residential, commercial and industrial and construction and land lending activities.\nOur lending activities include loans secured by commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Our multi-family residential loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans increased by an aggregate of 77.6%, 31.8% and 31.1% respectively, from December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021. Excluding PPP loans, our commercial and industrial loans increased by an aggregate of 8.2% over the same time period. Generally, multi-family residential, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to a variety of factors. Due to the larger loan balances typically involved in these loans, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one borrower relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2021, the largest outstanding balances of our multi-family residential, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans were $14.5 million, $12.3 million, and $22.6 million respectively. If a large loan were to become non-performing, as we have\nexperienced in the past, it can have a significant impact on our results of operations. Because we intend to continue our growth in multi-family residential, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, our credit risk exposure may increase and we may need to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nIn addition to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial, and multi-family residential loans, the Bank holds a significant portfolio of construction and land loans. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s construction and land loans amounted to $259.7 million, or 14.1% of our loan portfolio. Construction and land loans generally have a higher risk of loss than single-family residential mortgage loans due primarily to the critical nature of the initial estimates of a property\u2019s value upon completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction as well as other assumptions. If the estimates upon which construction loans are made prove to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with projects that, upon completion, have values which are below the loan amounts. If the Bank is forced to liquidate the collateral associated with such loans at values less than the remaining loan balance, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe operations of financial institutions are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. If general market rates of interest increase, our interest expense on deposits and borrowings would likely increase which could adversely affect our interest rate spread and net interest income. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets, our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives and the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nFluctuations in interest rates due to economic conditions and governmental or regulatory policies may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the FRB and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment of loans, the fair value of existing assets and liabilities, the purchase of investments, the retention and generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our earnings could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. We have adopted asset and liability management policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income or earnings. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates can impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nOn March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR benchmarks confirmed it would cease the publication of the one week and two-month LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. We have ceased originating LIBOR-based products effective December 2021 and transitioning all remaining LIBOR based products to an alternative benchmark over the next 18 months. The Company continues to monitor efforts and evaluate the impact of reference rate reform on its consolidated financial statements; however, the impact is not expected to be significant.\nRisks Related to Our Market Areas\nOur business is geographically concentrated in south Louisiana and west Mississippi, which are areas where the oil and gas industry has a significant presence. Reductions in prices in crude oil and gas, among other factors, could cause a downturn in the local economy, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our loans are to individuals and businesses located in south Louisiana and west Mississippi. The oil and gas industry has a significant presence in the market areas in which we operate. Regional economic conditions affect the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans. While crude oil prices have rebounded since the Spring of 2020, global markets for oil and gas were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued fluctuations in crude oil prices could adversely affect our operations and economic conditions in some of our markets during 2022 and future periods, which could adversely affect our future results of operations. Although the Company attempts to mitigate risk by diversifying its borrower base, approximately $40.3 million, or 2.2% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, at December 31, 2021 was comprised of loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry (which is also referred to as the \u201cenergy sector\u201d). We had an additional $14.6 million in unfunded loan commitments to companies in the energy sector at such date. At December 31, 2021, $1.9 million of our loans in the energy sector were on nonaccrual status, and $827,000 of our total allowance for loan losses was attributable to energy sector loans. Historically, the oil and gas industry has been an important factor in the local economy in our Acadiana and Natchez markets as well as the Houston market that we are entering upon the consummation of our merger with Friendswood Capital Corporation. If oil prices decline, it could have an adverse effect on our customers resulting in increased levels of nonperforming loans, provisions for loan losses and expense associated with loan collection efforts.\nA natural disaster, especially one affecting our market areas, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSince a considerable portion of our business is conducted in south Louisiana, most of our credit exposure is in that area. Historically, south Louisiana has been vulnerable to natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our loan portfolio, as uninsured or underinsured losses, including losses from business disruption, may reduce our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters in our market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nProlonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investment securities and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and elevated unemployment levels may result in higher loan delinquencies, increases in our non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reduction in problem assets can be slow, and the process can be exacerbated by the condition of the properties securing non-performing loans and the length of time involved in the foreclosure process. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover losses over the life of our financial assets.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which introduced a new model known as CECL. The new standard significantly changed the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, including off-balance sheet credit exposures, from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. We have established an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loans losses and losses on unfunded lending commitments, based upon various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio which we believe is adequate to offset expected losses on our existing financial assets. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in factors and forecasts used in evaluating the overall loan portfolio may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense in future periods. The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan asset quality ratings, delinquency status, historical credit loss experience, loan performance characteristics, forecasted information and other conditions influencing loss expectations. Changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhile we are not aware of any specific factors indicating a deficiency in the amount of our allowance for credit losses, in light of the current economic environment, one of the most pressing issues faced by financial institutions is the adequacy of their allowance for credit losses. Federal bank regulators routinely scrutinize the level of the allowance for credit losses maintained by regulated institutions. In the event that we have to increase our allowance for credit losses beyond current levels, it would have an adverse effect on our results in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses amounted to $21.1 million, or 1.15% of total loans and our total allowance for credit losses amounted to $22.9 million, or 1.24% of total loans. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the Company's methodologies for estimating expected credit losses.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. If our assumptions are incorrect, increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses would have a negative effect on our operating results.\nDeclines in the value of our investment securities may require us to take additional charges to earnings.\nCECL also requires expected credit related losses for available for sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses, while non-credit related losses will continue to be recognized through other comprehensive income. The Company\u2019s held to maturity debt securities are also required to utilize the CECL approach to estimate expected credit losses.\nWe evaluate our securities portfolio for impairment at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic and market conditions warrant such evaluations. If this evaluation indicates the existence of credit losses, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost. Delinquencies and defaults in the mortgage loans underlying these securities may adversely affect the cash flows received by us and may result in a conclusion in future periods that credit losses are expected from our securities portfolio. Such a conclusion, would require us to take additional charges to earnings to establish an allowance for credit losses for these securities.\nOur goodwill may be determined to be impaired at a future date depending on the results of periodic impairment tests.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary. If the quoted market price of our common stock were to decline significantly and the total book value of the Company, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value, we could be required to write down the amount recorded for goodwill. This, in turn, would result in a charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in shareholders\u2019 equity. See Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our goodwill and the required impairment test.\nChanges in accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements by affecting the value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because materially different amounts may be reported if different estimates or assumptions were used. If such estimates or assumptions underlying the financial statements are incorrect, we could experience material losses. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of such standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, it is possible, if unlikely, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our strategy of growing through mergers and acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions are currently a component of our business model and growth strategy. We currently have one merger pending, the acquistion of Friendswood Capital Corporation (\"Friendswood\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Texan Bank, N.A., and it is possible that we could acquire other banking institutions, other financial services companies or branches of banks in the future. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and, therefore, may result in the dilution of our tangible book value per share. Our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on various factors, including: (1) our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities; (2) our ability to finance and complete transactions on acceptable terms and at acceptable prices; and (3) our ability to receive the necessary regulatory and, when required, shareholder approvals. Our inability to engage in an acquisition or merger for any of these reasons could have an adverse impact on the implementation of our business strategies. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including: (1) our ability to achieve planned synergies and to integrate the branches and operations we acquire and the internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations and (2) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur pending merger may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.\nThe Company and Friendswood have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Home Bancorp and Friendswood upon the completion of the merger. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u2022the loss of key employees,\n\u2022the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, or\n\u2022inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe loss of key employees could adversely affect the ability of the combined company to successfully conduct businesses in the markets in which Home Bancorp and Friendswood now operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in future periods. Upon consummation of our pending merger with Friendswood, we will be expanding our operations into Texas for the first time and Friendswood\u2019s market area in Houston. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully transfer the business model and operations that we have utilized in our Louisiana markets to our\nproposed new market areas in Houston. In addition, if the combined company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us, Friendswood and/or the combined company to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Bank and/or move their business to competing financial institutions. These integration matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company during the transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the merger.\nThe combined company may fail to realize cost savings for the merger.\nAlthough we expect to realize cost savings from our pending merger with Friendswood when the merger integration is fully phased in, it is possible that these potential cost savings may not be realized fully or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, future business developments may require the combined company to continue to operate or maintain some facilities or support functions that are currently expected to be combined or reduced. Cost savings also depend on the combined company\u2019s ability to combine the businesses of Home Bancorp and Friendswood in a manner that permits those costs savings to be realized. If we are not able to combine the two companies successfully, these anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. This in turn could reduce or otherwise adversely affect the profitability of the combined company and adversely affect our stock price.\nOur financial performance and future growth may be negatively affected if we are unable to successfully execute our growth plans, which may include additional acquisitions.\nOver the past several years, we have grown our branch system primarily through acquisitions of other financial institutions. Our ability to successfully acquire other institutions depends on our ability to identify, acquire and integrate such institutions into our franchise. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our analysis of pending or future acquisitions was not complete and correct or our integration efforts were not successful. Currently, other than our pending Agreement and Plan of Merger with Friendswood Capital Corporation, we have no agreements or understandings with anyone regarding a future acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our Operational and Information Technology Systems\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur ability to adequately conduct and grow our business is dependent on our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational control infrastructure. Operational risk can arise in numerous ways including employee fraud, customer fraud and control lapses in bank operations and information technology. Our dependence on our employees and automated systems, including the automated systems used by acquired entities and third parties, to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical failures or tampering of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Failure to maintain an appropriate operational infrastructure can lead to loss of service to customers, legal actions and noncompliance with various laws and regulations.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into its existing businesses.\nSystem failure or cybersecurity breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other potential losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. The computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure we use, including our internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or users. Such problems could jeopardize the security of our customers\u2019 personal information and other information stored in and transmitted through our\ncomputer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers or inhibit current and potential customers from our internet banking services. Any or all of these problems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have security measures, including firewalls and penetration tests, designed to mitigate the possibility of break-ins, breaches and other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that such security measures will be effective in preventing such problems.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our customers, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our customers. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our customers, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. Our third-party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our customers, loss of business or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny, penalties or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial\nliability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally\nWe face strong competition which adversely affects our profitability.\nWe are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects and areas of our business from banks and other financial institutions. We are significantly smaller than several of the larger depository institutions operating in our market areas. The financial resources of these larger competitors may permit them to pay higher interest rates on their deposits and to be more aggressive in new loan originations. We also compete with non-financial institutions, including retail stores that maintain their own credit programs, governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers and non-traditional financial technology firms that are offering an increasing array of online loan, deposit and treasury management products. Some of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources, technological capabilities, lending limits, branch systems and a wider array of commercial banking services. Vigorous competition from both bank and non-bank organizations is expected to continue.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.", "PERMNO": 92810, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "HBCP"}
