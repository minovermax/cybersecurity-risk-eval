{"cik": "1590584", "company": "Civeo Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the price of our shares, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not complete the proposed change in the place of incorporation of Civeo from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada. If we do complete the change in the place of incorporation, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the redomiciliation, or the redomiciliation may adversely impact us or our stockholders.\nWe cannot assure that we will complete the announced change of place of incorporation of our parent company from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada. We may choose to defer or abandon the redomiciliation, or we may not be able to complete it because our stockholders do not approve the redomiciliation or certain other conditions are not satisfied.\nEven if we complete the redomiciliation to British Columbia, Canada, we may not realize the benefits that we expect to realize from the redomiciliation. The redomiciliation may also expose us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on us or our results of operations. Further, if the redomiciliation is completed, the rights of our shareholders as shareholders of a British Columbia company will differ from the rights they have currently as shareholders of a Delaware company.\nIn connection with the proposed migration, we have filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, and we will be filing documents with the SEC that contain other relevant materials. A definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to our shareholders once the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. You should read the definitive proxy statement/prospectus carefully and any other materials when they become available because they will contain important information about us and the redomiciliation, including risks related thereto.\nDecreased customer expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and gas and mining companies. If our customers\u2019 expenditures decline in regions where our facilities are located, our business will be impacted. The oil and gas and mining industries\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive resource prospects and the prevailing view of future commodity prices. Prices for oil, coal, natural gas, and other minerals are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, a sudden or long-term decline in commodity pricing would have material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing into early 2015, global oil prices dropped to their lowest level in five years due to concerns over global oil demand, the economic growth rate in China, the overall economic health of Europe and price cutting by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Increasing global supply including increased U.S. shale oil production has also negatively impacted pricing. With falling Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices, Western Canadian Select (WCS) has also fallen. WCS prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 averaged $57.75 per barrel compared to $78.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2014 and $73.48 per barrel in 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the WTI price was $53.27 and the WCS price was $37.27. Commodity prices, particularly with respect to the oil sands, could continue to deteriorate. A sustained continuation of these levels of commodity prices or further deterioration is likely to significantly depress levels of exploration, development, and production activity, often reflected as reductions in employees or resource production, and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, significant new regulatory requirements, including climate change legislation, could have an impact on the demand for and the cost of producing oil, coal and natural gas in the regions where we operate. Many factors affect the supply of and demand for oil, coal, natural gas and other minerals and, therefore, influence product prices, including:\n\u25cf\nthe level of activity and developments in the Canadian oil sands;\n\u25cf\nthe global level of demand, particularly from China, for coal and other natural resources produced in Australia;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict development;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of transportation infrastructure for oil, natural gas and coal, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u25cf\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nworldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries, such as China and India;\n\u25cf\nnational government political requirements, including the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n\u25cf\nthe level of oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u25cf\nrapid technological change and the timing and extent of energy resource development, including LNG or other alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental regulation; and\n\u25cf\nU.S. and foreign tax policies.\nOur failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new customer contracts could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew or replace our existing customer contracts and obtain new business. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including overall customer expenditure levels and the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing, or at all, or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. Because global oil prices dropped to their lowest level in five years in the fourth quarter of 2014, our customers may not renew contracts on terms favorable to us or, in some cases, at all, and we may have difficulty obtaining new business. Additionally, several contracts have clauses that allow termination upon the payment of a termination fee. As a result, our customers may choose to terminate their contracts. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness. Customer contract cancellations, the failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts or the failure to obtain new business would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDue to the cyclical nature of the natural resources industry, our business may be adversely affected by extended periods of low oil, coal or natural gas prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease our customers\u2019 spending and therefore our results.\nCommodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. This volatility causes oil and gas and mining companies to change their strategies and expenditure levels. Prices of oil, coal and natural gas can be influenced by many factors, including reduced demand due to lower global economic growth, surplus inventory, improved technology such as the hydraulic fracturing of horizontally drilled wells in shale discoveries, access to potential productive regions and availability of required infrastructure to deliver production to the marketplace. In particular, global demand for both oil and metallurgical coal is, at least partially, dependent on the growth of the Chinese economy. Should GDP growth in China slow further or contract, demand for oil and metallurgical coal and, correspondingly, our accommodations would fall, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business typically supports projects that are capital intensive and require several years to generate first production. The economic analyses conducted by our customers in oil sands, Australian mining and LNG investment areas have historically assumed a relatively conservative longer-term price outlook for production from such projects to determine economic viability. Current perceptions of lower commodity prices are causing our customers to reduce or defer major expenditures, particularly in Canada, given the long-term nature of many large scale development projects, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. In Canada, WCS crude is the benchmark price for our oil sands accommodations\u2019 customers. Historically, WCS has traded at a discount to WTI. Should the price of WTI decline or the WCS discount to WTI widen further, our oil sands customers may delay or eliminate additional investments, reduce their spending in the oil sands region or curtail or shut-down existing operations. Similarly, the volumes and prices of the mineral products of our customers, including coal and gold, have historically varied significantly and are difficult to predict. The demand for, and price of, these minerals and commodities is highly dependent on a variety of factors, including international supply and demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, actions taken by governments and global economic and political developments. Mineral and commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. We expect that a material decline in mineral and commodity prices could result in a decrease in the activity of our customers with the possibility that this would materially adversely affect us. No assurance can be given regarding future volumes and/or prices relating to the activities of our customers. We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes. In addition, the carrying value of our lodges or villages could be reduced by extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers, which has required us to record impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of the lodges or villages over fair value and had negatively impacted the value of our goodwill.\nIn 2014, we recorded goodwill impairments of $202.7 million and impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangibles, of $87.8 million. We may incur additional asset and/or goodwill impairment charges in the future, which charges will affect negatively our results of operations and financial condition.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. dollar reported results of operations and financial position and could impact our ability to pay dividends.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our reported revenues, net income and cash flows depending upon exchange rate movements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 93% of our revenues originated from subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and were denominated in either the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our reported revenues, net income and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any dividends we may pay will be paid in U.S. dollars. Weakness in the Canadian and Australian dollars could negatively impact our willingness to repatriate and exchange those foreign earnings and cash flows into U.S. dollars in order to make any dividend payments.\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and we are exposed to currency exchange risk primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian and Australian dollars. We may attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation where possible by entering into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency exposure. Our efforts to limit exchange risks may be unsuccessful, thereby exposing us to foreign currency fluctuations that could cause our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows to deteriorate.\nWe do business in Canada and Australia, whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the United States.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in Canada and Australia. These activities accounted for 93% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014. Risks associated with our operations in Canada and Australia include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\ndifferent taxing regimes;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital in a tax efficient manner;\n\u25cf\nchanging political conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanging foreign and U.S. monetary policies;\n\u25cf\nregional economic downturns;\n\u25cf\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets; and\n\u25cf\nforeign exchange limitations.\nThe regulatory regimes in these countries are substantially different than those in the United States, and are unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of foreign laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nAll of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases; if we are unable to renew a lease, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases. Accordingly, while we own the accommodations assets, we only own a leasehold in those properties. If we are found to be in breach of a lease, we could lose the right to use the property. In addition, unless we can extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate our facilities located on these properties upon expiration of the leases. In that event, we would be required to remove our accommodations assets and remediate the site. Generally, our leases have an initial term of ten years and will expire between 2015 and 2026 unless extended. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to renew our leases upon expiration on similar terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew leases on similar terms, it may have an adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the significant concentration of our business in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada and in the Bowen Basin coal region of Queensland, Australia, adverse events in these areas could negatively impact our business, and our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services.\nBecause of the concentration of our business in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada and in the coal producing region of Queensland, Australia, two relatively small geographic areas, we have increased exposure to political, regulatory, environmental, labor, climate or natural disaster events or developments that could disproportionately impact our operations and financial results. For example, in 2011, major flooding caused by seasonal rain and a cyclone impacted areas near our villages in Australia. Also in 2011, forest fires in northern Alberta impacted areas near our Canadian lodges. Due to our geographic concentration, any adverse events or developments in our operating areas may disproportionately affect our financial results.\nIn addition, a limited number of companies operate in the areas in which our business is concentrated, and occupancy at each of our lodges may be constrained by the radius which potential customers are willing to transport their workers. Our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services, and as to any single lodge or village, we may have few potential customers. Therefore, we are subject to volatility in occupancy in any location based on the capital spending plans of a limited number of customers, based on their changing decisions as to whether to outsource or use their own company-owned accommodations and whether other potential customers move into that lodge\u2019s radius.\nWe will incur incremental U.S. income taxes if we elect to repatriate our foreign earnings to the U.S., and our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe previously assumed for U.S. tax purposes that a significant portion of the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested abroad in the countries where such earnings are derived. However, based on our current forecasts for 2015, we determined that repatriation of a portion of our non-U.S. earnings to the U.S. is likely, because we expect that we will be required to reduce our outstanding indebtedness in order to comply with the maximum leverage ratio covenant as required under our Credit Facility, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, and that we will have lower earnings and cash flows in 2015. We will incur incremental U.S. income taxes that, subject to the availability of foreign tax credits (which are subject to various limitations), generally are based on the difference between U.S. and foreign income tax rates on such foreign earnings. As a result of the change in expectations, we recognized incremental income tax expense of $26.1 million in the fourth quarter 2014. Future repatriation to the U.S. may be necessary in order to allow for U.S. expansion, to repay debt incurred by Civeo and its U.S. subsidiaries or to satisfy covenants in our debt agreements.\nDevelopment of permanent infrastructure in the Canadian oil sands region, regions of Australia or various U.S. locations where we locate our assets could negatively impact our business.\nWe specialize in providing housing and personnel logistics for work forces in remote areas which often lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities. If permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop, grow or otherwise become available in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada, or regions of Australia where we locate villages, then demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services.\nWe depend on several significant customers, and the loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several significant customers. The majority of our customers operate in the energy or mining industry. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see \u201cBusiness\u201d in Item 1. The loss of any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in two industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not require collateral in support of our trade receivables.\nAs a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. In an economic downturn, commodity prices typically decline, and the credit markets and availability of credit could be constrained. Additionally, many of our customers\u2019 equity values could decline. The combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in Canada and Australia, and, to a lesser extent, the Rocky Mountain region and the Gulf of Mexico. A portion of our Canadian operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and, as a result, adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services in the second and, to a lesser extent, third quarters. During the Australian rainy season, generally between the months of November and April, our operations in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia can be affected by cyclones, monsoons and resultant flooding. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our customers. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Furthermore, the areas in which we operate are susceptible to forest fires, which could interrupt our operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nOur customers are exposed to a number of unique operating risks and challenges which could also adversely affect us.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to our clients\u2019 operations caused by any one of or all of the following singularly or in combination:\n\u25cf\nU.S. and international pricing and demand for the natural resource being produced at a given project (or proposed project);\n\u25cf\nunexpected problems, higher costs and delays during the development, construction and project start-up which may delay the commencement of production;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen and adverse geological, geotechnical, seismic and mining conditions;\n\u25cf\nlack of availability of sufficient water or power to maintain their operations;\n\u25cf\nlack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure necessary to maintain or to expand their operations;\n\u25cf\nthe breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their operations;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with the natural resources industry being subject to various regulatory approvals. Such risks may include a government agency failing to grant an approval or failing to renew an existing approval, or the approval or renewal not being provided by the government agency in a timely manner or the government agency granting or renewing an approval subject to materially onerous conditions;\n\u25cf\nrisks to land titles, mining titles and use thereof as a result of native title claims;\n\u25cf\nclaims by persons living in close proximity to mining projects, which may have an impact on the consents granted;\n\u25cf\ninterruptions to the operations of our customers caused by industrial accidents or disputes; and\n\u25cf\ndelays in or failure to commission new infrastructure in timeframes so as not to disrupt customer operations.\nWe may be adversely affected if customers reduce their accommodations outsourcing.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on customers outsourcing some or all of the services that we provide. Many oil and gas and mining companies in our core markets own their own accommodations facilities, while others outsource all or part of their accommodations requirements. Customers have largely built their accommodations in the past but will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost or allow them to accelerate the timing of their projects. We cannot be certain that these customer preferences will continue or that customers that have outsourced accommodations will not decide to perform these functions themselves or only outsource accommodations during the development or construction phases of their projects. In addition, labor unions representing customer employees and contractors have, in the past, opposed outsourcing accommodations to the extent that the unions believe that third-party accommodations negatively impact union membership and recruiting. The reversal or reduction in customer outsourcing of accommodations could negatively impact our financial results and growth prospects.\nIncreased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation terms of our accommodation services contracts may constrain our ability to make a profit.\nOur profitability can be adversely affected to the extent we are faced with cost increases for food, wages and other labor related expenses, insurance, fuel and utilities, especially to the extent we are unable to recover such increased costs through increases in the prices for our services, due to one or more of general economic conditions, competitive conditions or contractual provisions in our customer contracts. Oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated significantly in the last several years. Substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in cost increases in our lodges and villages. From time to time we have experienced increases in our food costs. While we believe a portion of these increases were attributable to fuel prices, we believe the increases also resulted from rising global food demand. In addition, food prices can fluctuate as a result of temporary changes in supply, including as a result of incidences of severe weather such as droughts, heavy rains and late freezes. While our long term contracts often provide for annual escalation in our room rates for food, labor and utility inflation, we may be unable to fully recover costs and such increases would negatively impact our profitability on contracts that do not contain such inflation protections.\nA failure to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages or serving alcoholic beverages may subject us to liability.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and a number of these claims may exist at any given time. Because food safety issues could be experienced at the source or by food suppliers or distributors, food safety could, in part, be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our locations could adversely impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business, and have a negative impact on our sales. Future food product recalls and health concerns associated with food contamination may also increase our raw materials costs and, from time to time, disrupt our business.\nA variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food (including, in some cases, requirements relating to the temperature of food), and the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level. We cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. Furthermore, legislation and regulatory attention to food safety is very high. Additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance or expose us to liabilities.\nWe serve alcoholic beverages at some of our facilities, and must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as local service laws. These laws generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate these laws, we may be liable to the patron and/or third parties for the acts of the patron. We cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us. There can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the jurisdictions in which we serve alcoholic beverages. If we are unable to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food, beverages or alcoholic beverages, the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.\nOur land banking strategy may not be successful.\nOur land banking strategy is focused on investing early in land in order to gain a strategic, early mover advantage in an emerging region or resource play. However, we cannot assure you that all land that we purchase or lease will be in a region in which our customers require our services in the future. We also cannot assure you that the property acquired by us will be profitably developed. Our land banking strategy involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities, which include the following risks:\n\u25cf\nthe regions in which we invest may not develop or sustain adequate customer demand;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur costs to acquire land and/or construct assets without securing a customer contract or prior to finalization of an accommodations contract with a customer and, if the contract is not obtained or delayed, the resulting impact could result in an impairment of the related investment;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations, and the issuance of permits is dependent upon a number of factors, including water and waste treatment alternatives available, road traffic volumes and fire conditions in forested areas;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired;\n\u25cf\nthe properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;\n\u25cf\nconstruction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public, government or aboriginal opposition to our activities; and\n\u25cf\nsubstantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations.\nOur business is contract intensive and may lead to customer disputes or delays in receipt of payments.\nOur business is contract intensive and we are party to many contracts with customers. We periodically review our compliance with contract terms and provisions. If customers were to dispute our contract determinations, the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect sales and operating results. In the past, our customers have withheld payment due to contract or other disputes, which has delayed our receipt of payments. While we do not believe any reviews, audits, delayed payments or other such matters should result in material adjustments, if a large number of our customer arrangements were modified or payments withheld in response to any such matter, the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nAll of our operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third-parties. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent requirements. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:\n\u25cf\nissuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\ndenial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u25cf\nreduction or cessation of operations; and\n\u25cf\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nConstruction risks exist which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are a number of general risks that might impinge on companies involved in the development, construction, manufacture and installation of facilities as a prerequisite to the management of those assets in an operational sense. We might be exposed to these risks from time to time by relying on these corporations and/or other third parties which could include any and/or all of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe construction activities of our accommodations are partially dependent on the supply of appropriate construction and development opportunities;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment approvals, slow decision making by counterparties, complex construction specifications, changes to design briefs, legal issues and other documentation changes may give rise to delays in completion, loss of revenue and cost over-runs which may, in turn, result in termination of accommodation supply contracts;\n\u25cf\nother time delays that may arise in relation to construction and development include supply of labor, scarcity of construction materials, lower than expected productivity levels, inclement weather conditions, land contamination, cultural heritage claims, difficult site access or industrial relations issues;\n\u25cf\nobjections to our activities or those of our customers aired by aboriginal or community interests, environment and/or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting or approvals and/or the overall progress of a project;\n\u25cf\nwhere we assume design responsibility, there is a risk that design problems or defects may result in rectification and/or costs or liabilities which we cannot readily recover; and\n\u25cf\nthere is a risk that we may fail to fulfill our statutory and contractual obligations in relation to the quality of our materials and workmanship, including warranties and defect liability obligations.\nThe cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill and long-lived assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, goodwill represented approximately 2% of our total assets, entirely in our Canadian reporting unit. We have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses that we acquired than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at each of our reporting units (Canada, Australia, and U.S.) annually, and when an event occurs or cicumstances change to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In 2014, we recognized goodwill impairment losses of $202.7 million in our Australia and U.S. reporting units. We may recognize additional goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n\u25cf\nglobal economic conditions deteriorate, including a decrease in the price of or demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe outlook for future profits and cash flow for our Canadian reporting unit deteriorate as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, need to satisfy changes in customers\u2019 accommodations requirements, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;\n\u25cf\ncosts of equity or debt capital increase; or\n\u25cf\nvaluations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate.\nIn addition, during 2014, we recognized impairments of our long-lived assets totaling $87.8 million. Extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers at our lodges or villages could require us to record further impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of the lodges or villages over fair value or could result in an impairment to our remaining goodwill balance of $45.3 million.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Certain environmental statutes impose joint and several strict liability for these costs. For example, an accidental release by us in the performance of services at one of our or our customers\u2019 sites could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nClimate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of depleting natural resources.\nThere are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of Canadian, Australian, U.S. federal, regional, provincial and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. These actions could:\n\u25cf\nresult in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers\u2019 operations;\n\u25cf\nincrease other costs to our business;\n\u25cf\nreduce the demand for carbon-based fuels; and\n\u25cf\nreduce the demand for our services.\nAny adoption of these or similar proposals by Canadian, Australian, U.S. federal, regional or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d in Item 1 for a more detailed description of our climate-change related risks.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nAcquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. We may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. An inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\nretaining key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nretaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nretaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;\n\u25cf\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u25cf\ndeveloping our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf\nmanaging our growth effectively;\n\u25cf\npotential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nintegrating operations;\n\u25cf\nmanaging tax and foreign exchange exposure;\n\u25cf\npotentially operating a new line of business;\n\u25cf\nincreased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations; and\n\u25cf\ninability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and our stockholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses. We maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, we are insured under Oil States\u2019 insurance policies for occurrences prior to the completion of the spin-off. The specifications and insured limits under those policies, however, may be insufficient for such claims. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\nthe counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and\n\u25cf\nwe may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur operations may suffer due to increased industry-wide capacity of certain types of assets.\nThe demand for and/or pricing of rooms and accommodation service is subject to the overall availability of rooms in the marketplace. If demand for our assets were to decrease, or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our capacity in excess of current demand, we may encounter decreased pricing for or utilization of our assets and services, which could adversely impact our operations and profits.\nIn addition, we have significantly increased our capacity in the oil sands region over the past seven years and in Australia over the past four years based on our expectation for current and future customer demand for accommodations in these areas. Should our customers build their own facilities to meet their accommodations needs or our competitors likewise increase their available accommodations, or activity in the oil sands or natural resources regions declines significantly, demand and/or pricing for our accommodations could decrease, negatively impacting our profitability.\nLoss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of our management. If any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance for any of our officers.\nEmployee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,300 employees in Canada and 400 employees in Australia. In addition, our facilities serving oil sands development work in Northern Alberta, Canada and mining operations in Australia house both union and non-union customer employees. We have not experienced strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns in the past, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future. A prolonged strike, work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our current collective bargaining agreements in Canada expire in 2017 and in Australia in 2015 and 2016.\nOur historical combined financial information may not be representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical combined financial information for periods prior to the spin-off that we have included in this annual report has been derived from Oil States\u2019 accounting records and may not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. Oil States did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a separate, stand-alone company for the historical periods prior to the spin-off. The costs and expenses reflected in such financial information include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Oil States, including expense allocations for: (1) certain corporate functions historically provided by Oil States, including, but not limited to finance, legal, risk management, tax, treasury, information technology, human resources, and certain other shared services; (2) certain employee benefits and incentives; and (3) equity-based compensation, that may be different from the comparable expenses that we would have incurred had we operated as a stand-alone company. These expenses were allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on estimated time spent by Oil States personnel, a pro-rata basis of headcount or other relevant measures of our business and Oil States and its subsidiaries. We have not adjusted our historical combined financial information for periods prior to the spin-off to reflect changes that occurred in our cost structure and operations as a result of our transition to becoming a stand-alone public company, including increased costs associated with an independent board of directors, SEC reporting and the NYSE requirements. Therefore, our historical financial information for periods prior to the spin-off may not necessarily be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be in the future. For additional information, see \u201cSelected Historical Financial Data\u201d in Item 6 and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this annual report.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us.\nOur Credit Facility contains operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) to consolidated interest expense, of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and our maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Credit Facility. EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined, exclude goodwill impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Our ability to comply with some of the covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants, ratios or tests likely will be impaired. Based on our current forecasts for 2015, we expect that we will be required to reduce our outstanding indebtedness in order to comply with our maximum leverage ratio covenant, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. We may not be able to reduce our indebtedness or otherwise refinance the Credit Facility. A failure to comply with these covenants, ratios or tests could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $775.0 million outstanding under the term loan portion of the Credit Facility, $5.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and capacity to borrow an additional $422.0 million under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, our borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility was reduced by approximately $222.2 million due to the negative covenants. If market or other economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, our borrowing capacity may be further reduced.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on our indebtedness as such payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\nour indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe covenants contained in the Credit Facility limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf\nour debt covenants also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in its industry; and\n\u25cf\nour indebtedness could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Recent Spin-Off from Oil States\nOur costs have increased as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nPrior to the spin-off, we operated our business as a segment of a public company. As a stand-alone public company, we are incurring additional legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses. For example, after the spin-off, we are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 and other sections of the Exchange Act. We also are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of the NYSE, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, have imposed increased regulation and disclosure and required enhanced corporate governance practices of public companies. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard are likely to result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. These changes may continue to require a significant commitment of additional resources. We may not be successful in implementing these requirements, and implementing them could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. If we do not implement such requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors and customers in our company and could materially adversely affect our business and cause our share price to fall.\nWe potentially could have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Oil States.\nThe agreements we entered into with Oil States in connection with the spin-off, including the separation and distribution agreement, tax sharing agreement, employee matters agreement, indemnification and release agreement and transition services agreement, were negotiated in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of Oil States. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Oil States. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the spin-off relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and other obligations between Oil States and us. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Oil States and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nOur tax sharing agreement with Oil States may limit our ability to take certain actions, including strategic transactions, and may require us to indemnify Oil States for significant tax liabilities.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement, we agreed to take certain actions or refrain from taking certain actions to ensure that the spin-off qualifies for tax-free status under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. We also made various other covenants in the tax sharing agreement intended to ensure the tax-free status of the spin-off. These covenants restrict our ability to sell assets outside the ordinary course of business, to issue or sell additional common stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our common stock), or to enter into certain other corporate transactions for a period of two years after the spin-off. For example, we may not enter into any transaction that would cause us to undergo either a 50% or greater change in the ownership of our voting stock or a 50% or greater change in the ownership (measured by value) of all classes of our stock in transactions considered related to the spin-off. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nFurther, under the tax sharing agreement, we are required to indemnify Oil States against certain tax-related liabilities incurred by Oil States (including any of its subsidiaries) relating to the spin-off, to the extent caused by our breach of any representations or covenants made in the tax sharing agreement or the separation and distribution agreement, or made in connection with the private letter ruling or the tax opinion obtained with respect to the spin-off. These liabilities include the substantial tax-related liability (calculated without regard to any net operating loss or other tax attribute of Oil States) that would result if the spin-off of our stock to Oil States stockholders failed to qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition, we have agreed to pay 50% of any taxes arising from the spin-off to the extent that the tax is not attributable to the fault of either party.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities for periods during which our subsidiaries and operations were those of Oil States.\nFor any tax periods (or portion thereof) in which Oil States owned at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our common stock, we and our U.S. subsidiaries will be included in Oil States\u2019 consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we or one or more of our U.S. subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of Oil States or one or more of its subsidiaries for U.S. state or local income tax purposes. Under the tax sharing agreement, for each period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are consolidated or combined with Oil States for purposes of any tax return, and with respect to which such tax return has not yet been filed, Oil States will prepare a pro forma tax return for us as if we filed our own consolidated, combined or unitary return, except that such pro forma tax return will generally include current income, deductions, credits and losses from us (with certain exceptions), will not include any carryovers or carrybacks of losses or credits and will be calculated without regard to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax. We will reimburse Oil States for any taxes shown on the pro forma tax returns, and Oil States will reimburse us for any current losses or credits we recognize based on the pro forma tax returns. In addition, by virtue of Oil States\u2019 controlling ownership and the tax sharing agreement, Oil States will effectively control all of our U.S. tax decisions in connection with any consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we (or any of our subsidiaries) are included. The tax sharing agreement provides that Oil States will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to prepare and file all consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we are included on our behalf (including the making of any tax elections), and to determine the reimbursement amounts in connection with any pro forma tax returns. This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between Oil States and us. For example, under the tax sharing agreement, Oil States will be able to choose to contest, compromise or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to Oil States and detrimental to us; provided, however, that Oil States may not make any settlement that would materially increase our tax liability without our consent. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the tax sharing agreement, U.S. federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group\u2019s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent Oil States or other members of Oil States\u2019 consolidated group fail to make any U.S. federal income tax payments required by law, we could be liable for the shortfall with respect to periods in which we were a member of Oil States\u2019 consolidated group. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state or local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with Oil States or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes.\nIf there is a determination that the spin-off is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings underlying the tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then Oil States and its stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nOil States received a private letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion of its outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the spin-off transaction. The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Oil States and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Oil States and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of its tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinion of Oil States\u2019 tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the spin-off is taxable in full or in part if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Oil States or us. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, Oil States and/or its stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities. For a description of the sharing of such liabilities between Oil States and us, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Oil States that we did not assume in our agreements.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for retained liabilities of Oil States. Under our agreements with Oil States, Oil States agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to these retained liabilities. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Oil States.\nOur prior and continuing relationship with Oil States exposes us to risks attributable to businesses of Oil States.\nOil States is obligated to indemnify us for losses that a party may seek to impose upon us or our affiliates for liabilities relating to the business of Oil States that are incurred through a breach of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement by Oil States or its affiliates other than us, or losses that are attributable to Oil States in connection with the spin-off or are not expressly assumed by us under our agreements with Oil States. Any claims made against us that are properly attributable to Oil States in accordance with these arrangements would require us to exercise our rights under our agreements with Oil States to obtain payment from Oil States. We are exposed to the risk that, in these circumstances, Oil States cannot, or will not, make the required payment.\nThe spin-off may have exposed us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that Oil States or any of its subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing shares of our common stock or taking other action as part of the spin-off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the debt incurred by us in connection with the spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) had reasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. If such court made this determination, the court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, voiding our liens and claims against Oil States, or providing Oil States with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Oil States and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than (i) the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or (ii) the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of shares of our common stock.\nUnder the separation and distribution agreement, Oil States is and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which Oil States and we, respectively, own and operate following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Oil States, particularly if Oil States were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates by analysts and our inability to meet those financial estimates;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions;\n\u25cf\nrisks related to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n\u25cf\nchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n\u25cf\nterrorist acts;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe paid quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.13 per share during the third and fourth quarters of 2014. In late December 2014, our board of directors, upon the unanimous recommendation of the value creation committee of the board, unanimously determined to suspend our quarterly dividend in order to maintain our financial flexibility and best position our company for long-term success. The declaration and amount of all dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by covenants in our credit facility. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends, and we may incur incremental taxes in the United States if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings to pay such dividends. If we elect to pay dividends in the future, the amount per share of our dividend payments may be changed, or dividends may again be suspended, without advance notice. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of market weakness. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors, limitations on the removal of directors, limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and limitations on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of our company. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could increase the difficulty for a third-party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock at a premium. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for our shares of common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u25cf\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. For some time, at least one of our shareholders, who, in the past, has been known for its shareholder activism, owns and may continue to own a material portion of our outstanding shares. Given our shareholder composition and other factors, it is possible such shareholder or future activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist shareholders or others in the future would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our revenue, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 14619, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "CVEO"}
