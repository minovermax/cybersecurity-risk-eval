{"cik": "845289", "company": "HARVEST NATURAL RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Sale of Our Gabon Interests and Our Proposed Dissolution and Liquidation\nRisks Related to the Proposed Sale of Our Gabon Interests\nWhile the proposed sale of our Gabon interests is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of this uncertainty, our current or potential business partners may decide to delay, defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending completion or termination of the proposed sale. In addition, while the proposed sale is pending, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management and employee attention from our day-to-day business;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption to contracting parties and service providers; and\n\u00b7\nthe possible inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that the proposed sale of our Gabon interests will be completed. If the proposed sale is not completed for any reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. Failure to complete the proposed sale will result in a reduction in the amount of cash otherwise available to us and, given that we do not currently have any operating cash inflows, may substantially limit our ability to implement any business strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that the proposed sale of our Gabon interests will be consummated despite receiving shareholder approval. The consummation of the proposed sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others, (1) the requirement that we obtain approvals of the proposed sale from the Government of Gabon; (2) requirements with respect to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties to the Sale and Purchase Agreement; and (3) requirements with respect to the satisfaction or waiver of the covenants and obligations of the parties to the Sale and Purchase Agreement. In addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances under its terms.\nWe are required to obtain approvals of the sale of our Gabon interests from the Gabonese Minister in Charge of Economy and the Gabonese Minister in Charge of Petroleum. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals, or that we\nwill be able to obtain these approvals on terms reasonably satisfactory to us and BW Energy. If these approvals are not obtained, then the Sale and Purchase Agreement may be terminated.\nWe cannot guarantee that all of the conditions to closing will be met. We or BW Energy may not be able to meet all of the closing conditions, and other closing conditions within the control of other parties (such as the required governmental approvals) may not be met. BW Energy would not be obligated to close the sale of our Gabon interests and could terminate the Sale and Purchase Agreement if we are not able to satisfy the closing conditions within our control or within the control of others. We also cannot be sure that circumstances will not rise that would also allow BW Energy to terminate the Sale and Purchase Agreement before the closing.\nIf the proposed sale does not close for any reason, our Board will be forced to evaluate other options. Our Board could decide to:\n\u00b7\nNegotiate a new sale and purchase agreement for the sale of our Gabon interests. The terms of any such new purchase agreement may be less favorable to us than the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement with BW Energy. It may not be possible to negotiate a new purchase agreement for the sale of our Gabon interests because there may not be any other offers to buy our Gabon interests on satisfactory terms. Negotiation of a new purchase agreement would entail a delay in our ability to sell our Gabon interests, during which we will have to continue to use our funds to pay general and administrative and other costs associated with managing the Dussafu PSC.\n\u00b7\nProceed with our proposed dissolution and sell our Gabon interests as part of our winding up procedures. Our Plan of Dissolution provides that we will sell all of our assets in existence when we dissolve. If these assets still include our Gabon interests, we will sell those interests on the best terms available, but without stockholder approval. Any such sale could be on terms less favorable than the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.\n\u00b7\nDecide to forego any sale of our Gabon interests in the near future and continue to manage the Dussafu PSC as we have done in the past, without dissolving Harvest. If we do this, we will have to satisfy our funding obligations for our Gabon operations with our available cash, which will reduce our cash reserves that could otherwise be distributed to our stockholders. We will also likely continue to incur the overhead costs attendant to being a publicly held company, including legal and accounting fees.\nIf the proposed sale does not close, our Board will make decisions regarding our future course based on their determination of what is in the best interests of our stockholders. However, the choices may be limited and may be less favorable to our stockholders than the proposed sale of our Gabon interests to BW Energy under the Sale and Purchase Agreement and our proposed ensuing dissolution.\nWe will be required to pay a break-up fee of $1.12 million if the Sale and Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. As disclosed in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, if the Sale and Purchase Agreement is terminated for certain reasons, we will be required to pay BW Energy a break-up fee of $1.12 million.\nOur executive officers may have interests in the proposed sale that are different from, or in addition to, the interests they may have as stockholders. In accordance with the terms of pre-existing agreements, our executive officers may receive change of control payments as a result of the consummation of the proposed sale of our Gabon interests, or as a result of the combination of the consummation of the proposed sale and a termination event under the applicable agreement. If we proceed with our proposed dissolution, it is very likely that the termination of employment of our executive officers will occur at some point in time after the dissolution. Accordingly, our executive officers may have interests in the proposed sale that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nThere is no guarantee that you will receive any of the net cash proceeds from the proposed sale of our Gabon interests in the form of distributions. The purchase price for the sale of our interests in Gabon will be paid to our wholly owned subsidiary, HNR Energia, which will distribute the proceeds to us in connection with its dissolution. While we intend to dissolve after the closing of the sale of our Gabon interests, after the payment of expenses related to the proposed sale (including taxes, if any) and reservation of some of the proceeds for operating costs, contingent liabilities and taxes, any use of the remaining proceeds will be at the discretion of our Board and based on its determination of what is in the best interests of Harvest and its stockholders at the time of determination. Our Board could decide not to pursue the dissolution and that we should use all or a significant portion of the net cash proceeds from the sale for purposes other than to pay dividends or make liquidating distributions to stockholders, including continuing our business.\nWe expect to delist our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange after the consummation of the proposed sale of our Gabon interests. If the proposed sale of our Gabon interests is consummated, our assets will consist primarily of cash. The NYSE continued listing requirements provide that a listed company\u2019s securities can be delisted if the company\u2019s operating assets have been substantially reduced. After the sale of our Gabon interests, we intend to delist our shares of common stock, after which they will no longer be tradable on the NYSE. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE would adversely affect liquidity and the trading price of our common stock.\nIf the sale of our Gabon interests fails to close and the Sale and Purchase Agreement is terminated, the NYSE may seek to delist our common stock due to our operating asset base, stock price or for another reason. Under these circumstances, we may seek to be traded on an alternative trading market, including one operated by OTC Markets Group.\nRisks Related to our Proposed Dissolution and Liquidation\nWe cannot assure you that any liquidating distribution will be made to our stockholders or, if made, the exact amount or timing of distributions. Our dissolution, liquidation and winding up process will be subject to uncertainties. It is possible that there will be no liquidating distribution made to our stockholders. The amount and timing of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders will depend on the following factors, among others:\n\u00b7\nWhether any potential claimants against us and currently unknown to us could present claims relating to our pre-dissolution operations that we may ultimately have to satisfy;\n\u00b7\nThe costs we may have to incur to defend new and existing claims, including possible claims against us relating to our dissolution and possible tax audits;\n\u00b7\nThe costs we may have to incur to continue to prosecute our existing lawsuit against Newfield, as well as possible new claims that we may need to file against others to preserve our rights and the value of our assets;\n\u00b7\nThe amounts that we will need to pay for general administrative and overhead costs and expenses as an operating company before our dissolution and the amounts that we will need to pay in connection with our post-dissolution survival period;\n\u00b7\nThe costs attendant on us as a publicly held reporting company under SEC regulations, including legal and auditing fees, especially if we are unable to obtain relief from requirements to continue preparing and filing our annual, quarterly and current reports;\n\u00b7\nHow much of our funds we will be required to reserve to provide for contingent liabilities, and how long it may take to finally determine whether and how much of those liabilities may have to be paid; and\n\u00b7\nHow long it will take us to liquidate all of our non-cash assets, including our Gabon interests if we are unable to consummate the transaction described in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.\nIf the sale of our Gabon interests is not consummated pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurances that any ultimate sale of those interests can be consummated and we may not be able to continue to fund our commitments under the associated Sale and Purchase Agreement and associated agreements. Our ability to realize value from our Gabon interests depends on our ability to sell those interests as soon as possible. We have devoted substantial time and cost to try to market our Gabon interests over the last three years and we believe that the transaction described in the Sale and Purchase Agreement is in our best interests. However, the consummation of that transaction is subject to several conditions, and there can be no assurances that those conditions will be satisfied or that the Sale and Purchase Agreement will not be terminated.\nIf the currently proposed sale of our Gabon interests does not close, then we will need to try to find another buyer, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so on terms more favorable to us than the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, or that we will be able to do so at all. If we are not able to find another buyer within the near future, we will be faced with a decision as to whether we should fund additional substantial commitments to maintain our interests in the Sale and Purchase Agreement or to conserve our funds for ultimate distribution to our stockholders and relinquish our interests in the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Either of these alternatives would have material adverse consequences to us and to our ability to provide our stockholders with liquidating distributions.\nWe will continue to incur expenses that will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Claims, liabilities and expenses from operations, such as operating costs, salaries, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and offices expenses will continue to be incurred by us as we wind down. We cannot estimate what the aggregate of these expenses will be, but they will reduce the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOur stockholders could be held liable for our corporate obligations, up to the amount actually distributed to them in connection with our dissolution. We will continue to exist for three years after our dissolution, or for such longer period as the Delaware Court of Chancery may direct, for the purpose of continuing to close our business, dispose of our non-cash assets, resolve outstanding litigation, discharge our liabilities and distribute any remaining assets to our stockholders. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, if the amount we reserve to satisfy our obligations proves insufficient to satisfy all of our expenses and liabilities, a stockholder who receives a liquidating distribution could be held liable for payment to our creditors of the stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of amounts we owe to our creditors in excess of the reserves, up to but not exceeding the amount actually distributed to the stockholder in connection with our dissolution. This means that a stockholder could be required to return all liquidating distributions made to the stockholder and receive nothing from us in connection with our dissolution and liquidation. If a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of those taxes could result in a stockholder incurring a net tax cost if the stockholder\u2019s repayment of an amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable. There is no guaranty that the reserves established by us to satisfy our obligations will be adequate to cover all of our obligations.\nOur Board may abandon implementation of our Plan of Dissolution. As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, our directors have the right to abandon our dissolution even after our stockholders have authorized our dissolution. While our\nBoard does not currently intend to do so, it will do so if it determines, based on intervening circumstances, that it is not in the best interest of our stockholders to continue with our dissolution.\nFurther stockholder approval will not be required in connection with the implementation of our Plan of Dissolution, including for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. Our Plan of Dissolution provides that we may sell our Gabon interests as part of our liquidation process, if the sale of our Gabon interests is not consummated under the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Our Plan of Dissolution also provides that we may sell our other assets after dissolution, as necessary to affect our Plan of Dissolution. In either case, under our Plan of Dissolution, we will not seek and are not required to seek additional stockholder authorization of any other asset sale.\nOur common stock will cease to be traded at the time of our dissolution. We intend to close our stock transfer books after our dissolution becomes effective. As a result, from and after that time, we will not recognize any transfer of our common stock, other than transfers by operation of law as to which we have received adequate written notice. The record date for determining which stockholders are eligible to receive liquidating distributions will be the date on which our dissolution becomes effective, except as may be necessary to reflect subsequent transfers by operation of law.\nWe may cease to file our annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. Because of the costs associated with preparing and filing our annual, quarterly and current reports under applicable securities laws, we intend to seek relief from all or some of our reporting obligations as soon as possible after the filing of our certificate of dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain this kind of relief from the SEC. However, if we receive relief, certain information about us (including audited financial information) currently reported to you and the public would no longer be available. Regardless, we do intend to provide our stockholders with reports on the status of our dissolution procedures from time to time, as our Board deems appropriate, either through the filing of current or other reports with the SEC or through other means of communication.\nOur officers may have interests in the dissolution that are different from those of our stockholders in general. In accordance with the terms of pre-existing agreements, such as our employment agreements with executive officers, our executive officers may receive certain benefits as a result of the termination of their employment as a result of our dissolution. Our officers will likely receive the additional severance benefits to which they became eligible as a result of the sale of our Venezuelan interests on October 7, 2016, because we currently expect to terminate their employment within 730 days following that date. If we proceed with our dissolution, it is expected that eventually and probably within this 730-day period, we will terminate the employment of all of our executive officers and we will be required to provide them with the severance benefits required by their employment agreements, including the additional severance benefits payable after a change of control. We estimate that the cost of making these payments will be $12 million.\nWe may undergo, or may have already undergone, an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of section 382 of the Code, which could affect our ability to use our net operating losses and certain tax credits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating losses and tax credits existing as of the date of the ownership change. For these purposes, an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 percent of a corporation\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period. The Treasury Regulations focus on changes in the ownership of significant stockholders, i.e., those owning, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the stock of a corporation (\u201c5% Stockholders\u201d). Currently, we do not believe that we have undergone an ownership change in the 2014, 2015 or 2016 taxable years, years in which we incurred significant net operating losses. We intend to monitor future filings with the SEC to determine if additional 5% Stockholders arise or if the ownership percentages of existing 5% Stockholders change, either of which might indicate an ownership change under section 382 of the Code. However, the Treasury Regulations under section 382 of the Code are complex and we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect whether and when we might undergo an ownership change.\nIf Harvest were to undergo one or more \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of section 382 of the Code, or if one has already occurred, our net operating losses and certain of our tax credits existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset income or gain, if any, from the proposed dissolution and liquidation of our subsidiaries. If we are unable to fully offset any U.S. federal taxable income or gain that results from those proposed dissolutions and liquidation, we may be liable for U.S. federal income taxes that could reduce the assets available for distributions to our stockholders.\nOn February 16, 2017, our Board adopted the Rights Plan, which is designed to preserve the Company\u2019s tax assets. For more information, see Item 1. Business - Other Recent Events - Rights Agreement to Protect Net Operating Losses.\nStockholders may not be able to recognize a loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes until they receive a final distribution from us. As a result of our dissolution and liquidation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders generally will recognize gain or loss, on a per share basis, equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value (at the time of the distribution) of property, if any, distributed to them with respect to each share of common stock and (2) their tax basis in each share of our common stock. A liquidating distribution pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution may occur at various times and in more than one tax year. Any loss generally will be recognized by a stockholder only in the tax year in which the stockholder\nreceives our final liquidating distribution, and then only if the aggregate value of all liquidating distributions with respect to a share of our common stock is less than the stockholder\u2019s tax basis for that share. Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of our dissolution, liquidation and winding up pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution.\nThe tax treatment of any liquidating distribution may vary from stockholder to stockholder. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of our complete dissolution and liquidation, and we will not seek an opinion of counsel with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of any liquidating distributions. If any of the anticipated tax consequences prove to be incorrect, the result could be increased taxation at the corporate or stockholder level, thus reducing the benefit to our stockholders and us from our dissolution and liquidation. Tax considerations applicable to particular stockholders may vary with and be contingent on the stockholder\u2019s individual circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisor for tax advice.\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to sell our Gabon interests. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the sale of our Gabon interests. For so long as we continue to operate our Gabon interests, we are subject to a number of risks related to our business and industry, including those discussed below.\nOur business may be sensitive to market prices for oil and natural gas. We have made significant investments in our oil and natural gas properties. To the extent market values of oil and natural gas decline, the valuation of the investments in these projects may be adversely affected.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A general slowdown in economic activity could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to access additional capital as well as the need to preserve adequate development capital in the interim.\nOur portfolio of hydrocarbon assets in known hydrocarbon basins globally is exposed to greater deal execution, operating, financial, legal and political risks. The environments in which we operate are often difficult and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to control the pace of development, our ability to apply \u201cbest practices\u201d in drilling and development, and the fostering of productive and transparent relationships with local partners, the local community and governmental authorities. Financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for our projects. In addition, often the legal systems of these countries are not mature and their reliability is uncertain. This may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and operate oil and natural gas projects, as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses. Our business depends on our ability to have significant influence over operations and financial control.\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth. Actual production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used, and these variances may be material.\nOur future operations and our development are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities. Oil and natural gas exploration and development drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;\n\u00b7\nshortages in experienced labor;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7\nequipment or facilities failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nremediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\ngovernment actions or changes in regulations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in receiving necessary governmental permits;\n\u00b7\ndelays in receiving partner approvals; and\n\u00b7\nweather conditions.\nThe prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and availability for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. We cannot give any assurance that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable. Drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs.\nWe operate in international jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government and other officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts of corruption committed by our employees or agents. Any additional expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperations in areas outside the United States are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. Our operations are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, civil unrest, strikes and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, being subject to foreign laws, legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or tribunals, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies, including taxes, governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign policy, foreign trade, taxation and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations. Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations. These regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations, bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. At various times, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and natural gas production. In order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas, these agencies have restricted the rates of the flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u00b7\nthe amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;\n\u00b7\nresponse to unexpected releases to the environment;\n\u00b7\nreports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production and other operations; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages. We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses, and insurance may not protect us against all of these risks. We are not insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the risk of:\n\u00b7\nfires and explosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable or unknown flows of oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses;\n\u00b7\npipeline ruptures;\n\u00b7\ndischarges of toxic gases;\n\u00b7\nbuildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials; and\n\u00b7\nvandalism.\nIf any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil and natural gas reservoirs;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\ninvestigatory and clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepairs to resume operations.\nIf we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not insurable.\nCompetition within the industry may adversely affect our operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and natural gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy. We are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy. Loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy.\nPotential regulations regarding climate change could alter the way we conduct our business. Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that requires reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries including the European Union have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce and as a result, negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. The proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If these information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations may be adversely affected and operating results could be harmed. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the future growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. Our information technology systems, and those of third party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75734, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HNR"}
