{"cik": "1594012", "company": "Investors Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to\nbe immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial originations, our credit risk will increase.\nAt December 31, 2016, our portfolio of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans totaled $13.50 billion, or 71.8% of our total loans. We intend to continue to increase our originations of multi-family, commercial real estate and C&I loans, which generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, local economy or the management of the business or property. In addition, our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings.\nIf the bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 386% of Bank total risk-based capital at December 31, 2016.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank's primary federal regulator were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings would be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If actual results differ significantly from our assumptions, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016 of $228.4 million was 1.21% of total loans and 220.18% of non-performing loans at such date.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant portions of our multi-family loan portfolio and commercial real estate portfolio and nearly all of our C&I loan portfolio are unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur multi-family loan portfolio has increased to $7.46 billion at December 31, 2016 from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Our commercial real estate portfolio has increased to $4.45 billion at December 31, 2016 from $1.97 billion at December 31, 2012. Our C&I loan portfolio has increased to $1.28 billion at December 31, 2016 from $169.3 million at December 31, 2012. Consequently, a large portion of our multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans and nearly all of our C&I loans are unseasoned. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in the economic environment since 2012. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur liabilities reprice faster than our assets and future increases in interest rates will reduce our profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Conversely, an increase in interest rates generally reduces prepayments. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our total securities portfolio was $3.44 billion. Unrealized net losses on securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available-for-sale portfolio decreases, our stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate the change in our net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. The economic value of equity analysis is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At December 31, 2016, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates increase evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no action to mitigate the effect of such change, the model projects that we would experience a 6.2% or $40.9 million decrease in net interest income and 11.5% or $550.7 million decrease in economic value of equity.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the past several years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels than available prior to 2008. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. However, our ability to lower our interest expense will be limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. Accordingly, our net interest income may be adversely affected and may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our future profitability.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our business, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur total assets have grown from approximately $12.72 billion at December 31, 2012 to $23.17 billion at December 31, 2016. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to open new branch locations, successfully attract deposits, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, and acquire other banks and non-bank entities. In the event that we do not continue to grow, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality, remain in good standing with our regulators, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits.\nPublic funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2016, $3.36 billion, or 22.0% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities, primarily domiciled in the state of New Jersey, such as school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB and investment securities. Given our use of these high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net income.\nWe could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell into the secondary market a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate through our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage. The whole loan sale agreements we enter into in connection with such loan sales require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there is a breach of any of representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We have established a reserve for estimated repurchase and indemnification obligations on the residential mortgage loans that we sell. We make various assumptions and judgments in determining this reserve. If our assumptions are incorrect, our reserve may not be sufficient to cover losses from repurchase and indemnification obligations related to our residential loans sold. Such event would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nFHLB funds are an important source of funding for the Company and a reduced level may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe borrow directly from the FHLB and various financial institutions. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are unable to secure alternative funding or need to rely on more expensive funding sources, our operating margins, profitability and liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $77.6 million recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could result in impairments to goodwill. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. We operate in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis results in impairment to goodwill, we would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nInvestors Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDBI, our chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the CFPB, with respect to consumer protection laws. As a bank holding company, Investors Bancorp is subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to shareholders, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, compliance and privacy issues (including anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act Compliance) and approval of merger transactions. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on Investors Bank, Investors Bancorp and our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability.\nInvestors Bank Entered Into an Informal Agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.\nOn August 12, 2016, Investors Bank agreed to enter into an informal agreement (\u201cInformal Agreement\u201d) with the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (\u201cNJDOBI\u201d) with regard to Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) compliance matters. Investors Bank agreed to; 1) develop, adopt and implement a system of internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with BSA; 2) conduct a comprehensive validation of Investors Bank\u2019s BSA/AML automated compliance system; and 3) develop, adopt and implement effective training programs relating to BSA. Investors Bank also agreed to review certain transactions and accounts for BSA and AML compliance and to establish a Compliance Committee of the Board. Numerous actions have been taken or commenced by Investors Bank to strengthen its BSA and AML compliance practices, policies, procedures and controls. Investors Bank has enhanced its risk management and compliance programs through restructured reporting lines, improved technology and increased staff, including hiring senior personnel. The failure to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Informal Agreement could lead to further action by the FDIC and NJDOBI, which could adversely affect Investors Bank. The costs to remediate are unknown and could adversely affect our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow relative to prior post-recession periods despite the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s unprecedented efforts to maintain low market interest rates and encourage economic growth. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and unemployment levels may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and we intend to pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.\nGrowing by acquisition entails integration and certain other risks.\nAlthough we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, failure to successfully integrate systems subsequent to the completion of any future acquisitions could have a material impact on the operations of Investors Bank.\nFuture acquisition activity could dilute book value.\nBoth nationally and in our region, the banking industry is undergoing consolidation marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions. From time to time we may be presented with opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches and we may engage in discussions and negotiations. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values, and therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the CFPB, tightened capital standards and will continue to result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many years. However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will materially increase our operating and compliance costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, such as Investors Bank. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which excludes (subject to certain grandfathering rules) certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities. Regulations implementing this requirement were effective January 1, 2015.\nEffective July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts, which could result in an increase in our interest expense.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The legislation also increased the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directed the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. It also provided that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose \u201cclawback\u201d policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives.\nEffective December 10, 2013, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking and securities regulators issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. Generally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. After the transition period, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to banking entities, including Investors Bancorp, unless an exception applies.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule, effective January 1, 2015, that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4% under prior rules); (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5%. The required minimum capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nNew regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans.\nThe CFPB has issued a final rule which implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage loan. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \"bona fide discount points\" for prime loans);\n\u2022interest-only payments;\n\u2022negative-amortization; and\n\u2022terms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nPolicy makers have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code in 2017. Possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate tax rate, modifying the U.S. taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. While we may benefit on a prospective net income basis from any decrease in corporate tax rates, proposals being discussed currently could result in a material decrease in the value of our deferred tax asset, which would also result in a material reduction to net income during the period in which the change is enacted. Regulatory capital could also be reduced if the decrease in the value of deferred tax assets exceeds certain levels. Given the number of uncertainties relating to the ultimate form any corporate tax reform may take, it is not possible to quantify the potential negative impact to our income or regulatory capital that could result from corporate tax reform.\nWe currently utilize incentive-based payment arrangements with our employees as compensation practices. Potential regulatory changes to this practice could have an impact on our current practices and impact our results of operations.\nInvestors Bank is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nAny future increase in FDIC insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings.\nAs a \u201clarge institution\u201d within the meaning of FDIC regulations (i.e., greater than $10 billion in assets), Investors Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premium is determined differently than smaller banks. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. However, beginning in 2011, large institutions became subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments. In October 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule, effective March 1, 2013, which clarifies and refines its large bank assessment formula. Since the large institution assessment procedure is still relatively new, the long term effect on Investors Bank\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is uncertain.\nWe may eliminate dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders, stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in domestic and global economies and other factors could cause our board of directors to consider, among other things, the elimination of or reduction in the amount and/or frequency of cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nWe continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthen our controls and ensure compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have an impact on information security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThere have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to effectively deploy the capital raised in our second step conversion offering may have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe invested 50% of the net proceeds from our second step conversion offering in Investors Bank; provided funding to our Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the purchase of 6,617,421 shares of common stock sold in the offering; and contributed $20.0 million to Investors Charitable foundation by issuing 1,000,000 shares and a $10.0 million cash contribution. A substantial portion of the net proceeds were used to pay off short-term borrowings as they matured and invest in securities. We continue to utilize the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, among other items, paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock. Our failure to deploy the capital effectively may reduce our profitability and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur recruitment efforts may not be sufficient to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations.\nAs we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement our business strategy.\nWe have hired an asset based and leveraged lending team and expanded our business lending into the healthcare market, both of which may expose us to increased lending risks and may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn an effort to diversify our loan portfolio, we have expanded our lending team to include asset based and leveraged lending teams as well as a healthcare lending team. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and multi-family loans, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, because we are not as experienced with these new loan products, we may require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products effectively or may be unsuccessful in offering such products at a profit.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area and Northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90952, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ISBC"}
