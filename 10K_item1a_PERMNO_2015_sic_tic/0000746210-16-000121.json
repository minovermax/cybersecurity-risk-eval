{"cik": "746210", "company": "GLOWPOINT, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nGlowpoint\u2019s business faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties may also affect our business. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on Glowpoint\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. When making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may fail to comply with covenants contained in our loan agreement with Main Street Capital Corporation (\u201cMain Street\u201d).\nOur loan agreement with Main Street, which was amended in February 2015, contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific types of transactions, including covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u00b7\nincur or assume certain liens;\n\u00b7\nmake certain loans, advances or investments;\n\u00b7\npay dividends;\n\u00b7\nmake certain acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u00b7\nmake certain capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nprepay subordinated debt;\n\u00b7\nissue certain equity securities;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nmake certain increases in management compensation.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant, that are tested on a quarterly basis. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under Item 7 of this Report for a description of Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the Company\u2019s current financial projections for 2016, we believe that it is likely that the Company will violate both the existing fixed charge coverage ratio and the debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenants beginning in mid-2016. We are currently exploring various alternatives to address our forecasted violations of our financial covenants, which may include renegotiation of our loan agreement with Main Street, a capital raise, a conversion of a portion of our debt to equity or a debt refinancing. If the Company were to violate any of its covenants under its senior loan agreement or its other debt arrangements, any such violations could cause an acceleration of the indebtedness under such loan agreements. In the event that our lenders accelerate the repayment of the indebtedness under any loan agreement, we would not have sufficient resources and/or cash flow to repay the indebtedness. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nWe have renegotiated financial covenants and/or refinanced our indebtedness in the past but there is no assurance we will be able to successfully renegotiate or refinance all or any portion of our indebtedness in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance the indebtedness under the loan agreements upon acceleration or when otherwise due, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our obligations under the loan agreements, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations and to fund our operating expenses, planned capital expenditures, and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under our loan agreements or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, to seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to pursue other alternatives, including the disposition of material assets or operations, in order to satisfy our debt service and other obligations. However, we may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or financing transactions or to obtain any proceeds on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur business activities may require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and our ability to operate going forward.\nAlthough there can be no assurance, in the event we are successful in addressing our forecasted covenant violations for 2016, the Company believes that, based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, it has, and will have, sufficient resources and cash flows to service its debt obligations and fund its operations for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report with the SEC. Our capital requirements continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue, the expense to deliver our services, expense for sales and marketing, capital improvements, expense for research and development, and the cost involved in protecting our proprietary rights. If we are unable to increase our revenue or achieve profitability, or if unforeseen events occur that would require additional funding, we may need to raise capital or incur additional debt to fund our operations. We would expect to seek such capital through sales of additional equity or debt securities and/or loans from financial institutions, but there can be no assurance that funds will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and any sales of such securities may be dilutive to investors. Failure to obtain\nfinancing or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms could result in a decrease in our stock price and would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects, or require us to significantly reduce operations.\nWe have a history of substantial net losses and we may incur future net losses.\nWe have reported a substantial net loss from operations in fiscal years 2013 through 2015. We cannot assure you that we will achieve revenue growth or profitability or generate positive cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we do not achieve profitability in the future, the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted and we could have difficulty obtaining capital to continue our operations.\nWe may incur substantial legal costs in litigation defense.\nOn July 23, 2015, UTC Associates Inc. (\u201cUTC\u201d) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. On September 22, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 13, 2015, in response to the Company\u2019s motion, UTC filed an amended complaint. On November 2, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On February 1, 2016, the Court partially granted and partially denied the dismissal motion. The Court dismissed with prejudice the fraud claim and declined to dismiss the two breach of contract claims. This matter involves allegations that Glowpoint has failed to pay amounts allegedly due under a Technology Development & Operations Outsourcing arrangement dated June 30, 2010. UTC seeks monetary damages totaling $2,107,000, including $1,107,000 for damages arising from the breach of an alleged guaranteed minimum provision, and $1,000,000 for damages arising from the breach of an alleged exclusivity provision. The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company may incur substantial legal costs to defend this matter, and management may be required to focus its attention and time on this matter. To the extent there is an adverse outcome with respect to this litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is highly dependent on the evolution of our overall market and on general economic conditions.\nThe market for video communication services is evolving rapidly. Although certain industry analysts project significant growth for this market, their projections may not be realized. Our future growth depends on acceptance and adoption of video communications. There can be no assurance that the market for our services will grow, that our services will be adopted or that businesses will purchase our suite of managed video services. If we are unable to react quickly to changes in the market, if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, then we are unlikely to achieve profitability. Additionally, current economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any one of those customers, or several of our smaller customers, could materially harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, two major customers accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue. The composition of our significant customers will vary from period to period, we expect that most of our revenue will continue, for the foreseeable future, to come from a relatively small number of customers. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period based on the actions of one or more significant customers. A customer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as reasons related to the customer\u2019s financial condition, changes in the customer\u2019s business strategy or operations, changes in technology and the introduction of alternative competing products, or as the result of the perceived quality or cost-effectiveness of our products. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we materially breach the agreement or for other reasons outside of our control such as insolvency or financial hardship that may result in a customer filing for bankruptcy court protection against unsecured creditors. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant or several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and many of our competitors have greater financial resources and established relationships with major corporate customers.\nThe video communications industry is highly competitive and includes large, well-financed participants. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, furnish some of the same services provided by us, and have established relationships with major corporate customers that have policies of purchasing directly from them. The Company\u2019s competitors offer services similar to ours both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive\nenvironment with pressure on pricing of such services. We believe that as the demand for video communications systems continues to increase, additional competitors, many of which may have greater resources than us, will continue to enter the video communications market.\nThere is limited market awareness of Glowpoint\u2019s services.\nOur future success will be dependent in significant part on our ability to generate demand for our video collaboration services. To this end, our direct marketing and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our service offerings to generate increased revenue. We have limited sales and marketing resources, with 8 employees in sales and marketing as of December 31, 2015, and without additional capital, we have limited resources and/or cash flow for spending on advertising, marketing and additional personnel. Our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. If we were to hire new employees in sales and marketing, those employees will require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that our new hires will become as productive as necessary or that we will be able to hire enough qualified individuals or retain existing employees in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to market and sell our products and services, and if we are not successful in building market awareness and generating increased sales, future results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAs we expand our managed services offerings, any system failures or interruptions may cause loss of customers.\nOur success depends, in part, on the seamless, uninterrupted operation of our managed service offerings. As we continue to expand these services, and as the complexity and volume continue to increase, we will face increasing demands and challenges in managing them. Any prolonged failure of these services or other systems or hardware that cause significant interruptions to our operations could seriously damage our reputation and result in customer attrition and financial loss.\nWe rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or may not perform adequately.\nWe integrate third-party licensed software components into our technology infrastructure (e.g., ServiceNow Inc.) in order to provide our services. This software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or pricing or may fail to continue to be updated to remain competitive. The loss of the right to use this third-party software may increase our expenses or impact the provisioning of our services. The failure of this third-party software could materially impact the performance of our services and may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nWe depend upon our network providers and facilities infrastructure.\nOur success depends upon our ability to implement, expand and adapt our network infrastructure and support services to accommodate an increasing amount of video traffic and evolving customer requirements at an acceptable cost. This has required and will continue to require that we enter into agreements with providers of infrastructure capacity, equipment, facilities and support services on an ongoing basis. We cannot ensure that any of these agreements can be obtained on satisfactory terms and conditions. We also anticipate that future expansions and adaptations of our network infrastructure facilities may be necessary in order to respond to growth in the number of customers served.\nOur network could fail, which could negatively impact our revenues.\nTo an extent, our success depends upon our ability to deliver reliable, high-speed access to our channels\u2019 and customers\u2019 data centers and upon the ability and willingness of our telecommunications providers to deliver reliable, high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. Our network and facilities, and other networks and facilities providing services to us, are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized accessor cessation of operations from human error and tampering, breaches of security, fires, earthquakes, severe storms, power losses, telecommunications failures, software defects, intentional acts of vandalism including computer viruses, and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the network operations center, key sites at which we locate routers, switches and other computer equipment that make up the backbone of our service offering and hosted infrastructure, or at one or more of our partners\u2019 data centers, could substantially and adversely impact our business. We cannot ensure that we will not experience failures or shutdowns relating to individual facilities or even catastrophic failure of the entire network or hosted infrastructure. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or service providers could result in reductions in, or terminations of, services supplied to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur network depends upon telecommunications carriers who could limit or deny us access to their network or fail to perform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely upon the ability and willingness of certain telecommunications carriers and other corporations to provide us with reliable high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. If these telecommunications carriers and other corporations decide not to continue to provide service to us through their networks on substantially the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, price, early termination liability, and installation interval), if at all, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of our service level objectives are dependent upon satisfactory performance by our telecommunications carriers. If they fail to so perform, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of providing video communications services, we transmit sensitive and proprietary information of our customers. We are dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our information systems, including without limitation those systems utilized in our operations. We have undertaken measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and on an annual basis, we test the adequacy of our security measures. As part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to proprietary customer data stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. However, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures will detect and prevent security breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations. We may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems. We may be held liable to our affiliates and customers, which could result in reputational damage, litigation, or negative publicity.\nWe may experience material disconnections and/or reductions in the prices of our services and may not be able to replace the loss of revenues.\nHistorically, we have experienced both significant disconnections of services and also reductions in the prices of our services. In order to realize anticipated revenues and cash flows, we endeavor to obtain long-term commitments from new customers, as well as expand our relationships with current customers. The disconnection of services by our significant customers or by several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Service contract durations and termination liabilities are defined within the terms and conditions of our agreements with our customers. Termination of services in our existing agreements require a minimum of 30 days\u2019 notice and are subject to early termination penalties equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid charges including the remaining term length multiplied by any fixed monthly fees. The standard form of service agreement with Glowpoint includes an auto-renewal clause at the end of each term if the customer does not choose to terminate service at that time. Certain customers and partners negotiate master agreements with custom termination liabilities that differ from our standard form of service agreement.\nWe may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology.\nThe market for our video collaboration services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing managed video services obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. A significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive is our ability to successfully introduce new products and services that embody new technology, anticipate and incorporate evolving industry standards and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market. If our managed video services are unable to meet expectations or unable to keep pace with technological changes in the video communication industry, our managed video services could eventually become obsolete. We may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to upgrade our managed video services as improvements in video communication technologies are introduced. In the event that other companies develop more advanced service offerings, our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success and competitive position depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary intellectual property to be used in connection with our services. While we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or we could commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor.\nIn the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to: pay substantial damages; cease the development, use or sale of services that infringe upon other patented intellectual property; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property; discontinue the use or incorporation of infringing technology; or obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property. We cannot ensure that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available upon reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nAn adverse outcome as plaintiff, in addition to the costs involved, may, among other things, result in the loss of the intellectual property (such as a patent) that was the subject of the lawsuit by a determination of invalidity or unenforceability, significantly increase competition as a result of such determination, and require the payment of penalties resulting from counterclaims by the defendant.\nWe may not be able to protect the rights to our intellectual property.\nFailure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation and/or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent. As we further develop our services and related intellectual property, we expect to seek additional patent protection. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that: any of the patents owned by us or other patents that other parties license to us in the future will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us, if issued at all; or any patents owned by or licensed to us, although valid, will not be dominated by a patent or patents to others having broader claims. Additionally, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships.\nWe are exposed to the credit and other counterparty risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business.\nOur customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness and we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in their creditworthiness and overall financial condition, which could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment under our contracts with them. In the event that a material customer or customers default on their payment obligations to us, discontinue buying services from us or use their buying power with us to reduce our revenue, this could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future plans could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel.\nWe have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce. Our future success is dependent in part on attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees (including Peter Holst, our President and CEO) could materially and adversely affect our business development and therefore, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our actual liability for sales and use taxes and regulatory fees is different from our accrued liability, it could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nEach state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility\nfor interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed. We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes. The assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon suppliers and have limited sources for some services.\nWe rely on other companies to supply some components of our network infrastructure and the means to access our network. Certain products and services that we resell and certain components that we require for our network are available only from limited sources. We could be adversely affected if such sources were to become unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot ensure that, on an ongoing basis, we will be able to obtain third-party services cost-effectively and on the scale and within the time frames that we require, if at all. Failure to obtain or to continue to make use of such third-party services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to properly manage the distribution of our services could result in a loss of revenues.\nWe currently sell our services both directly to customers and through channel partners. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our services is a complex process. Each sales channel has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales model for our services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe incur significant accounting and administrative costs as a publicly traded corporation that impact our financial condition.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned so their comparatively lower accounting and administrative costs can be a competitive disadvantage for us. Should our sales decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls and audits, our costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders may not be confident in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect the price of our stock and harm our business.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating To Our Securities\nOur common stock is thinly traded and subject to volatile price fluctuations.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and it is therefore susceptible to wide price swings. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \u201cGLOW.\u201d Thinly traded stocks are more susceptible to significant and sudden price changes and the liquidity of our common stock depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers. We cannot ensure that you will be able to find a buyer for your shares. We cannot ensure that an organized public market for our securities will develop or that there will be any private demand for our common stock. We could also fail to satisfy the standards for continued exchange listing, such as standards having to do with a minimum share price, the minimum number of public shareholders or the aggregate market value of publicly held shares. Any holder of our securities should regard them as a long-term investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of an investment in our securities for an indefinite period.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is presently subject to these regulations which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of purchasers of our shares of common stock to sell such securities.\nFuture operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, and we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results. Factors that cause fluctuation in our results of operations include lack of growth or declines in revenue and our ability to control expenses relative to our revenue. Accordingly, it is possible that in one or more future quarters our operating results will be adversely affected and fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future.\nResale into the public market of a significant number of shares issued in prior financings could depress the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future. In addition, to the extent other restricted shares become freely available for sale, whether through an effective registration statement or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or if we issue additional shares that might be or become freely available for sale, our stock price could decrease.\nAlthough the sale of shares to the public might increase the liquidity of our stockholders\u2019 investments, the increase in the number of shares available for public sale could drive the price of our common stock down, thus reducing the value of your investment and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future.", "PERMNO": 81761, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OBLG"}
