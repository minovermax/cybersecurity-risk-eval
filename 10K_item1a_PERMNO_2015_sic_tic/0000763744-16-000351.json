RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but represent the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect the RV, manufactured housing and other industries we supply our products to, as well as our business, operations or financial position. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other risk factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties.\nIndustry Risk Factors\nEconomic and business factors beyond our control, including cyclicality and seasonality in the industries where we sell our products, could lead to fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe RV and manufactured housing markets, as well as other markets where we sell our products or where our products are used, have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand. Periods of economic recession have adversely affected, and could again adversely affect, our operating results. Companies in these industries are subject to volatility in production levels, shipments, sales and operating results due to changes in external factors such as general economic conditions, including credit availability, consumer confidence, employment rates, prevailing interest rates, inflation, fuel prices and other economic conditions affecting consumer demand and discretionary consumer spending, as well as demographic and political changes. Consequently, our operating results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nAdditionally, manufacturing operations in the RV and manufactured housing industries, as well as other industries where we sell our products or where our products are used, historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, our sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, and the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which we sell our components, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may also, from time to time, impact the timing of industry-wide shipments from one period to another.\nReductions in the availability of wholesale financing limits the inventories carried by retail dealers of RVs and manufactured homes and other products which use our components, which would cause reduced production by our customers, and therefore reduced demand for our products.\nRetail dealers of RVs and manufactured homes and other products which use our components generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing known as floor-plan financing provided by lending institutions. Reduction in the availability of floor-plan financing has in the past caused, and would likely cause, many dealers to reduce inventories, which would result in reduced production, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Moreover, dealers which are unable to obtain adequate financing could cease operations. Their remaining inventories would likely be sold at discounts, disrupting the market. Such sales have historically caused a decline in orders for new inventory, which reduced demand for our products.\nConditions in the credit market could limit the ability of consumers to obtain retail financing for RVs and manufactured homes, resulting in reduced demand for our products.\nRestrictions on the availability of consumer financing for RVs and manufactured homes and increases in the costs of such financing have in the past limited, and could again limit, the ability of consumers to purchase RVs and manufactured homes, which would result in reduced production of RVs and manufactured homes by our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products.\nLoans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates, and are more difficult to obtain, than mortgages for site-built homes. Historically, lenders required a higher down payment, higher credit scores and other criteria for these loans. Current lending criteria are higher than historical criteria, and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify.\nThe availability, cost, and terms of these manufactured housing loans are also dependent on economic conditions, lending practices of financial institutions, government policies, and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. Reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited, and could continue to limit, the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes, resulting in reduced production of manufactured homes by our customers, and therefore reduced demand for our products. In addition, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulate financial transactions, could make certain types of mortgages more difficult to obtain - in particular those historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes. Although legislation has been introduced to address this matter, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has been reviewing this matter, there can be no assurance of the outcome.\nExcess inventories at dealers and manufacturers can cause a decline in the demand for our products.\nDealers and manufacturers could accumulate unsold inventory. High levels of unsold inventory have in the past caused, and would cause, a reduction in orders, which would likely cause a decline in demand for our products.\nGasoline shortages, or high prices for gasoline, could lead to reduced demand for our products.\nFuel shortages, and substantial increases in the price of fuel, have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past, and could again in the future. Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, components for which represented approximately 73 percent of our RV Segment net sales in 2015, are usually towed by light trucks or SUVs. Generally, these vehicles use more fuel than automobiles, particularly while towing RVs. High prices for gasoline, or anticipation of potential fuel shortages, can affect consumer use and purchase of light trucks and SUVs, which could result in reduced demand for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, and therefore reduced demand for our products.\nThe manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant long-term decline in shipments, which has led to reduced demand for our products.\nOur MH Segment, which accounted for 8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2015, operates in an industry which has experienced a decline in production of new homes compared to the peak of production in 1998. The downturn was caused, in part, by limited availability and high cost of financing for manufactured homes, and was exacerbated by economic and political conditions during the financial crisis.\nAlthough industry-wide wholesale production of manufactured homes has improved in recent years, our annual results of operations could decline if manufactured housing industry conditions were to worsen.\nCompany-Specific Risk Factors\nA significant percentage of our sales are concentrated in the RV industry, and declines in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs could reduce demand for our products and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nIn 2015, the RV Segment represented 92 percent of our consolidated net sales, and 90 percent of consolidated segment operating profit. Approximately 73 percent of our RV Segment net sales in 2015 were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. While we measure our RV Segment sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. Retail sales of RVs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions, as well as consumer confidence which was above historical averages in 2015. Declines in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nVolatile raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nThe prices we pay for steel and aluminum represented approximately 45 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of our raw material costs in 2015. These, and other key raw materials, have historically been volatile and can fluctuate dramatically with changes in the global demand and supply for such products.\nBecause competition and business conditions may limit the amount or timing of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to our customers in the form of sales price increases, future increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. Conversely, as raw material costs decline, we may not be able to maintain selling prices consistent with higher cost raw materials in our inventory, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe import a portion of our raw materials and the components we sell and the effect of foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results\nWe negotiate for the purchase of a significant portion of raw materials and semi-finished components with suppliers that are not located in the United States. As such, the prices we pay in part are dependent upon the rate of exchange for US Dollars versus the currency of the local supplier. A dramatic weakening of the US Dollar could increase our cost of goods sold and such cost increases may not be offset through price increases for our products, adversely impacting our margins.\nInadequate supply of raw materials or components used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends on our ability to source raw materials, such as steel and aluminum, and certain components in a timely and cost efficient manner. If raw materials or components that are used in manufacturing our products, particularly those which we import, become unavailable, or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted or delayed, our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected. We currently import, or purchase from suppliers who import, approximately 24 percent of our raw materials and components. Consequently, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports and on a consistent basis for a significant portion of our raw materials and components. Labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions, and could have an adverse impact on our operating results if we are unable to fulfill customer orders or required to accumulate excess inventory or find alternate sources of supply, if available, at higher costs.\nThe loss of any customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nTwo customers of the RV Segment accounted for a combined 39 percent, and another customer of both the RV Segment and the MH Segment accounted for 26 percent, of our consolidated net sales in 2015. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer preferences relating to our products could cause reduced sales.\nChanges in consumer preferences, or our inability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, for RVs or manufactured homes, or for the products we make for RVs and manufactured homes, could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nCompetitive pressures could reduce demand for our products or impact our sales prices.\nDomestic and foreign competitors may lower prices on products which currently compete with our products, or develop product improvements, which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to reduce prices for our products. In addition, the manufacture by our customers themselves of products supplied by us could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIncreases in demand could result in difficulty obtaining additional skilled labor, and available capacity may initially not be utilized efficiently.\nIn certain geographic regions in which we have manufacturing facilities we have experienced, and could again experience, shortages of qualified employees. Competition for skilled workers, especially during improving economic times, may increase the cost of our labor and create employee retention and recruitment challenges, as employees with knowledge and experience have the ability to change employers relatively easily. If such conditions become extreme, we may not be able to increase production to timely satisfy demand, and may initially incur higher labor and production costs, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur unexpected expenses, or face unanticipated delays, in connection with investments we make in our business, which could adversely impact our results.\nIt may take longer than initially anticipated for us to realize expected results from investments in research and development or acquired businesses, as well as initiatives we have implemented to increase capacity and improve production efficiencies, automation, customer service and other aspects of our business, or we may incur unexpected expenses in connection with these matters. These conditions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have recently entered new markets in order to enhance our growth potential. Uncertainties with respect to these new markets could impact our operating results.\nWe are a leading supplier of components for RVs and manufactured housing, and currently have a significant share of the market for certain of our products, which limits our ability to expand our market share for those products. We have made investments in order to expand the sale of our products in the RV and manufactured housing aftermarket, and in adjacent industries beyond RVs and manufactured housing. We are also exploring opportunities to increase export sales of our products to international markets. Limited operating experience or limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy. Lack of demand for our products in these markets or competitive pressures requiring us to lower prices for our products could adversely impact our business growth in these markets and our results of operations.\nIf acquired businesses are not successfully integrated into our operations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe have completed several business acquisitions and may continue to engage in acquisitions or similar activities, including joint ventures and other business transactions that involve potential risks, including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such transactions, assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses, and possible culture conflicts. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully. If we are unable to efficiently integrate these businesses, the attention of our management could be diverted from our existing operations, which could impair our ability to execute our business plans. Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations or to realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key management could reduce our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the knowledge, experience and skill of our managerial personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key managers or the failure to attract or retain qualified management staff could impair our ability to execute our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to numerous international, federal, state and local regulations, and increased costs of compliance, failure in our compliance efforts or events beyond our control could result in damages, expenses or liabilities that could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products, including regulations and standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) of the United States Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), and consumer safety standards promulgated by state regulatory agencies and industry associations, and the failure to comply with present or future regulations and standards could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. Sales in foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations. Any recalls of our products, voluntary or involuntary, could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nFurther, certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect our activities. Areas of our business affected by such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, quality of services, warranty, product liability, real estate, intellectual property, tax, import and export, and competition. We are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which further complicates compliance efforts. Violations of any such laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving healthcare, health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future by governmental authorities. Our operating profit margin in 2015 was impacted by higher health insurance costs, largely due to increased employee participation, which we believe is largely due to the new healthcare requirements, and operating profit will likely continue to be impacted in future periods.\nOur operations are subject to certain environmental laws and regulations, and costs of compliance, investigation or remediation of environmental conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are also subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air, water, noise pollution and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and its state counterparts, liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. Although we believe that our operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations, one or more of our current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third-parties, have been affected by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, we may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation. If other potentially responsible persons (\u201cPRPs\u201d) are unable or otherwise not obligated to contribute to remediation costs, we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs, and those costs could be material. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks, and we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe rely on certain trademarks and patents, including contractual rights with third parties. We endeavor to protect our rights; however, third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights. We may be forced to take steps to protect our rights, including through litigation. This could result in a diversion of resources. The inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to claims by third parties, seeking to enforce their claimed intellectual property rights.\nCompliance with conflict mineral disclosure requirements will create additional compliance cost and may create reputational challenges.\nThe SEC adopted rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use or potential use of certain minerals, deemed conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts on our part to assess whether such minerals are used in our products in order to make the relevant required annual disclosures. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers\noffering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand. We may also face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nIf our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached, our operations could be disrupted and could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operation.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, inventory, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, manufacturing, distribution, warranty administration, invoicing, collection of payments, and other business processes. We use information systems to report and support the audit our operational and financial results. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our sales, marketing, human resources and communication efforts. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, security breaches, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other manipulation or improper use of our systems. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Due to our reliance on our information systems, we have established various levels of security, backup and disaster recovery procedures. Further, we have selected and have begun implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, the full implementation of which is expected to take several years; however, there may be other challenges and risks as we upgrade and standardize our ERP system on a company-wide basis.\nIf we expand our business internationally, we will be subject to new operational and financial risks.\nWe have been gradually growing sales overseas, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 1 percent of 2015 consolidated net sales. We plan to continue pursuing international opportunities. Business outside of the United States is subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control, including: changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations; difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents; differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices; cultural and linguistic differences; foreign currency fluctuations and limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls; different liability standards; and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition, as well as impact our ability to operate in international markets.", "PERMNO": 87426, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "LCII"}
