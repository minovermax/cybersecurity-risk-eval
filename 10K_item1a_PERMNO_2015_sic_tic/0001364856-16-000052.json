{"cik": "1364856", "company": "Monarch Financial Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves risk, and you should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose some or all of your investment. You should carefully read the risks described below before you decide to buy any of our common stock. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Proposed Merger with Towne\nCombining with Towne may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger with Towne may not be realized.\nThe Company and Towne have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Towne's and the Company's ability to successfully combine and integrate the business of the Company and Towne in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing client relations or result in decreased revenue due to loss of clients. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. If the combined companies experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. There also may be business disruptions that cause the Company and /or Towne to lose clients or cause clients to remove their accounts from the Company and/or Towne and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on both the Company and Towne during the transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined Company.\nAdditionally, the combined company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other synergies that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of each party to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. The circumstances could have an adverse effect on combined company business, results of operations and stock price.\nIf the merger with Towne is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Towne. If the merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger with Towne is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger with Towne on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on us. The uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by us may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate the Company's business in the ordinary course prior to closing.\nThe merger may distract management of the Company from its other responsibilities.\nThe merger could cause the management of the Company to focus its time and energies on matters related to the merger that otherwise would be directed to its business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of the Company's management, if significant, could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect the business and earnings of the Company before the merger, or the business and earnings of Towne after the merger.\nThe merger Agreement limits the ability of the Company to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains a \"no-shop\" provision that, subject to limited exceptions, limits the ability of the Company to facilitate competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company, subject to certain restrictions, consummates a similar transaction other than the merger, the Company must pay to Towne a termination fee of $8.0 million. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration, with respect to the Company, with a higher per share market price than the proposed merger.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nBefore the merger may be completed, Towne and the Company must obtain approvals from the FDIC, Virginia State Corporation Commission, Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Although Towne and the Company do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nChanges in interest rates may impact our net interest margin and profitability.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds. Our net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control, including competition, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Our net interest margin is impacted when the Federal Reserve increases or decreases interest rates, due to our loan and deposit maturities and structure. We try to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but we are unable to completely eliminate this risk.\nChanges in our delivery method for loans held for sale may impact profitability.\nWe manage the majority of our interest rate risk by locking in the interest rate for each mortgage loan with our correspondents (investors) and borrowers at the same time, which is a \u201cbest efforts\u201d delivery system. A smaller portion of our delivery system utilizes a \u201cmandatory delivery\u201d process. Under the mandatory delivery system the interest rate risk associated with a rate lock on a mortgage loan shifts from the investor back to our Company. Therefore, to the extent we adopt the mandatory delivery system our interest income could be adversely impacted if mortgage rates were to become volatile. We had $72.8 million in mortgage loans in the mandatory delivery system at year end.\nOur profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in our market area.\nOur success depends to a large degree on the general economic conditions in Greater Hampton Roads, Virginia. In recent years our market experienced a downturn in which we saw falling home prices, rising foreclosures, reduced economic activity, increased unemployment and an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies. Although the economy in the nation has seen improvement, our local economy is lagging because of military dependency and the impact of government cutbacks. If economic conditions in our market further deteriorate, we could experience any of the following consequences, each of which could further adversely affect our business:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services could decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase; and\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase.\nWe could experience further adverse consequences in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market due to our exposure to commercial loans across various lines of business. A prolonged economic downturn could impact collateral values or cash flows of the borrowing businesses, and as a result our primary source of repayment could be insufficient to service the debt. In addition, adverse consequences to us in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market could be compounded by the fact that many of our commercial and real estate loans are secured by real estate located in our market area. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished. In addition, a number of our loans are dependent on successful completion of real estate projects and demand for homes, both of which could be affected adversely by a decline in the real estate markets.\nFuture economic conditions in our market will depend on factors outside of our control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military and fiscal policies and inflation. Adverse changes in economic conditions in our market would likely impair our ability to collect loans and could otherwise have a negative effect on our financial condition.\nIf we experience greater loan losses than anticipated, it will have an adverse effect on our net income and our ability to fund our growth strategy.\nWhile the risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in banking, if we experience greater nonpayment levels than we anticipate, our earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our monitoring, procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses. In addition, as a result of the growth in our loan portfolio, loan losses may be greater than management\u2019s estimates of the appropriate level for the allowance. Loan losses can cause insolvency and failure of a financial institution and, in such an event, our stockholders could lose their entire investment. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Any loan losses will reduce the loan loss allowance. A reduction in the loan loss allowance will be restored by an increase in our provision for loan losses. This would reduce our earnings, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to manage our balance sheet to minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuation on our net interest margin.\nOur results of operations depend on the stability of our net interest margin, which is dependent in part on the difference between the rates we receive on loans and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds. Interest rates, because they are influenced by, among other things, expectations about future events, including the level of economic activity, federal monetary and fiscal policy and geo-political stability, are not predictable or controllable. In addition, the interest rates we can earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates we pay on our deposits are heavily influenced by competitive factors. Community banks are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional, super-regional or national banks that have access to national and international capital markets. These factors influence our ability to maintain a stable net interest margin.\nOur long-term goal is to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that we may reasonably predict our net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production and deposit flows are constantly changing and influence our ability to maintain this neutral position. Generally speaking, our earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates the greater the variance in the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of interest rates, and whether we are more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, we may not be successful in maintaining this neutral position and, as a result, our net interest margin may suffer, which will negatively impact our earnings. Based on our asset and liability position at December 31, 2015, a rise or decline in interest rates would have limited impact on our net interest income in the short term.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations; we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are a client-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our clients by our executive and senior lending officers. We have entered into employment agreements with Brad E. Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, E. Neal Crawford, Jr., President of the Company, Andrew N. Lock, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer of the Company, Lynette P. Harris, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Denys D. Diaz, Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer of the Company and William T. Morrison, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch Mortgage. The existence of such agreements, however, does not necessarily ensure that we will be able to continue to retain their services. Several other members of management currently have employment agreements to retain their services. The unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings.\nAlso, our anticipated growth and success, in large part, will be due to the services provided by our mortgage banking officers and the employees of our residential mortgage division. The loss of services of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and our business could suffer. With the exception of Mr. Morrison, our mortgage loan originators are not a party to any employment agreement with us, and they could terminate their employment with us at any time and for any reason.\nThe implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new client relationships as well as new financial products and services. Many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing clients if they were to leave their current employment. These agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult. The market for these people is competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, hiring, motivating or retaining them.\nOur operations depend upon third party vendors that perform services for us.\nWe outsource many of our operating and banking functions, including our data processing function, our item processing and the interchange and transmission services for our ATM network. As such, our success and our ability to expand our operations depend on the services provided by these third parties. Disputes with these third parties can adversely affect our operations. We may not be able to engage appropriate vendors to adequately service our needs, and the vendors we engage may not be able to perform successfully.\nRevenue from our mortgage banking operations are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates or new legislation and may adversely impact our profits.\nOur mortgage banking division, Monarch Mortgage, has provided a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and maintaining our revenue stream in this segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors. Mortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect Monarch Mortgage\u2019s mortgage originations and, consequently, reduce its income from mortgage lending activities. New legislation could also adversely affect its operations.\nDeteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages. In addition, if it is proven a borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or that appraisals have not been acceptable or the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, Monarch may be required to repurchase the loan or provide financial settlement to the investor. Such repurchases or settlements would also adversely affect our net income.\nPeriods of rising interest rates will adversely affect our income from our mortgage division.\nIn periods of rising interest rates, consumer demand for new mortgages and re-financings decreases which in turn, adversely impacts our mortgage banking division. Because interest rates depend on factors outside of our control, we cannot eliminate the interest rate risk associated with our mortgage operations.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.\nIn June 2013, federal regulators issued final rules that revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these proposals are applicable to us when effective, and will add to and change the definitions of \u201ccapital\u201d for regulatory purposes, the types and minimum levels of capital required under the prompt corrective action rules and for other regulatory purposes, and the right-weighting of various assets. These changes in capital requirements could result in lower returns on equity, require raising additional capital, or subject us to regulatory action if we are unable to comply, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. As of December 31, 2015, $664.9 million, or 80.2% of our loans held for investment were secured by real estate (both residential and commercial). A major change in the real estate market, such as deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect our clients\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could negatively impact us. Risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result credit losses may occur in the future.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nopen new banking offices;\n\u2022\nattract deposits to those locations; and\n\u2022\nidentify attractive loan and investment opportunities.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future. Our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth; maintain cost controls and asset quality and successfully integrate any new banking offices into our organization.\nAs we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new banking and mortgage offices, we expect to incur construction costs and increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. We generally must absorb those higher expenses while we continue to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, our plans to grow could depress our earnings in the short run, even if we efficiently execute this growth.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counter-party and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counter-parties, and we routinely execute transactions with counter-parties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecent legislative regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions could adversely affect us.\nBanking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices,\ndividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts to businesses were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, financial institutions can now offer interest on demand deposits to compete for clients. Our interest expense may increase and our net interest margin may decrease if we begin paying interest on demand deposits to attract additional clients or to maintain current clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur directors and executive officers own our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nAs of March 6, 2016, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 1,166,925 shares or 9.6% of our common stock. Accordingly, such persons will be in a position to exercise substantial influence over our affairs and may impede the acquisition of control by a third party. We cannot assure investors that the interests of our directors and executive officers will always align precisely with the interests of the holders of our common stock.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment. Some of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured state-chartered banks, national banks and federal savings institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. Some of these competitors are subject to similar regulation but have the advantages of larger established client bases, higher lending limits, extensive banking office networks, numerous ATMs, greater advertising-marketing budgets and other factors.\nCompetition in our target market area for loans to businesses, professionals and consumers is very strong. Most of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than us and offer certain services, such as extensive and established banking office networks and trust services that we cannot provide. Moreover, larger institutions operating in Hampton Roads have access to borrowed funds at a lower cost than is available to us. Several community banks are headquartered in our trade areas. Several regional and super-regional banks, as well as a number of large credit unions, also have banking offices in our market area. Competition among institutions for checking and saving deposits in the area is intense.\nOur legal lending limit may limit our growth.\nWe are limited in the amount we can lend to a single borrower by the amount of our capital. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus, of Monarch Bank, to any one borrower. As of December 31, 2015, we were allowed to lend approximately $20 million to any one borrower and maintained an in-house limit of approximately $16 million to any one borrower. This amount is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our legal lending limit from doing business with us. Our legal lending limit also impacts the efficiency of our lending operation because it tends to lower our average loan size, which means we have to generate a higher number of transactions to achieve the same portfolio volume. We can accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not efficient or always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain clients seeking larger loans or may not be able to sell participations in such loans on terms we consider favorable.\nIf our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and performance of our clients relative to their financial obligations with us. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our\ncontrol, and these losses may exceed our current estimates. Rapidly growing loan portfolios are, by their nature, unseasoned. As a result, estimating loan loss allowances is more difficult, and may be more affected by changes in estimates, and by losses exceeding estimates, than more seasoned portfolios. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we cannot fully predict such losses or that our loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material and adverse impact on our financial performance. Because of our growth strategy, we expect that our earnings will be negatively impacted by loan growth, which requires additions to our allowance for loan losses. Consistent with our loan loss reserve methodology, we expect to make additions to our loan loss reserve levels as a result of our growth strategy, which may affect our short-term earnings.\nFederal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in the amount of our provision or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. In addition, as part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client information. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject the Company and the Bank to regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company and the Bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to operate profitably may depend on our ability to implement various technologies into our operations.\nThe market for financial services, including banking services and consumer finance services is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, computers, automation, Internet-based banking and telebanking. Our ability to compete successfully in our markets may depend on the extent to which we are able to exploit such technological changes. If we are not able to afford such technologies, properly or timely anticipate or implement such technologies, or properly train our staff to use such technologies, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth, we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable. This could negatively affect our performance and the value of our Common Stock.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. We anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at new banking locations as well as investment opportunities. However, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time. We may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed.\nContinued growth may require raising additional capital which may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage.\nIn order to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, we may, from time to time, need to raise additional capital to support continued growth. If selling our equity securities raises additional funds, the relative ownership interests of our existing stockholders would likely be diluted.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur need to comply with extensive and complex government regulation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities. Many of the banking regulations we are governed by are intended to protect depositors, the public or the insurance funds maintained by the FDIC, not stockholders. Banking regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our rate of growth and changes in regulations could adversely affect us. The burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and us specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors. In addition, the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to reduce losses or operate profitably.\nIn addition, because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future nor the impact those changes may have on our operations. We fully expect that the financial institution industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices.\nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Act will increase our regulatory compliance burdens, and may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our earnings and/or capital ratios.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act, which represented a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), tightened capital standards, imposed clearing and margining requirements on many derivatives activities, and generally increased oversight and regulation of financial institutions and financial activities.\nIn addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for over 200 administrative rulemakings by numerous federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation. While many rules have been finalized and/or issued in proposed form, additional rules have yet to be proposed. It is not possible at this time to predict when all such additional rules will be issued or finalized, and what the content of such rules will be. We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which has and may continue to increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings and/or capital.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and/or our ability to conduct business.\nVirginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our Common Stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our Common Stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of us. These provisions include the division of our board of directors into classes with staggered terms, the ability of our board of directors to set the price, term and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock and the ability of our board of directors, in evaluating a proposed business combination or other fundamental change transaction, to consider the effect of the business combination on us and our stockholders, employees, customers and the communities which we serve. Similarly, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contains provisions designed to protect Virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. These provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. These provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors, to affect its policies generally and to benefit from actions which are opposed by the current board of directors.", "PERMNO": 89799, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MNRK"}
