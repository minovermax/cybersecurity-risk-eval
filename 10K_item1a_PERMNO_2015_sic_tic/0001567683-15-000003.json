{"cik": "1567683", "company": "NRG Yield, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Business\nCertain facilities are newly constructed and may not perform as expected.\nAll of the Company's conventional and renewable assets have achieved commercial operations within the past six years. The ability of these facilities to meet the Company's performance expectations is subject to the risks inherent in newly constructed power generation facilities and the construction of such facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of the Company's expectations, system failures, and outages. The failure of these facilities to perform as the Company expects could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's common stock.\nPursuant to the Company's cash dividend policy, the Company intends to distribute all or substantially all of the cash available for distribution through regular quarterly distributions and dividends, and the Company's ability to grow and make acquisitions through cash on hand could be limited.\nThe Company expects to distribute all or substantially all of the cash available for distribution each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities and, if applicable, borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. The Company may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions if the projected short-term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment, after giving effect to the Company's available cash reserves. The Company's growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of dividends on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that the Company will be unable to maintain or increase its per share dividend. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by NRG Yield Operating LLC or by the Company's project-level subsidiaries to finance the Company\u2019s growth strategy will result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants, which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions the Company receives to distribute to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe Company's business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of additional generation assets (including through corporate acquisitions). This strategy depends on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms. However, the number of acquisition opportunities is limited. In addition, the Company will compete with other companies for these limited acquisition opportunities, which may increase the Company\u2019s cost of making acquisitions or cause the Company to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors for acquisitions are much larger than the Company with substantially greater resources. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company\u2019s financial or human resources permit. If the Company is unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will impede the Company\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategy and limit the Company\u2019s ability to increase the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s ability to acquire future renewable facilities may depend on the viability of renewable assets generally. These assets currently are largely contingent on public policy mechanisms including ITCs, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation, RPS and carbon trading plans. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of the Company\u2019s growth strategy and expansion into clean energy investments.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions will also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions.\nThe Company may not have sufficient availability under the Company\u2019s credit facilities or have access to project-level financing on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. An inability to obtain the required or desired financing could significantly limit the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future acquisitions and effectuate the Company\u2019s growth strategy. If financing is available, utilization of the Company\u2019s credit facilities or project-level financing for all or a portion of the purchase price of an acquisition could significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest expense, impose additional or more restrictive covenants and reduce cash available for distribution. Similarly, the issuance of additional equity securities as consideration for acquisitions could cause significant stockholder dilution and reduce the Company\u2019s per share cash available for\ndistribution if the acquisitions are not sufficiently accretive. The Company\u2019s ability to consummate future acquisitions may also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals for such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, approval by FERC under Section 203 of the FPA.\nFinally, the acquisition of companies and assets are subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which the Company may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis) and the ability to retain customers. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may divert management\u2019s attention from the Company's existing business concerns, disrupt the Company's ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund the Company\u2019s operations or pay dividends. It could also expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates and limit the Company\u2019s ability to react to changes in the economy or the Company\u2019s industry as well as impact the Company\u2019s cash available for distribution.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $4,050 million of total consolidated indebtedness, $3,224 million of which was incurred by the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\u2019s share of its unconsolidated affiliates\u2019 total indebtedness and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2014, totaled approximately $567 million and $20 million, respectively (calculated as the Company\u2019s unconsolidated affiliates\u2019 total indebtedness as of such date multiplied by the Company\u2019s percentage membership interest in such assets). On July 22, 2013, the Company entered into a $60 million revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated on April 25, 2014, to increase the available line of credit to $450 million and extend its maturity to April 2019. The revolving credit facility can be used for cash or for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2014, there were $38 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. In addition, the Company had $296 million of letters of credit outstanding to support contracted obligations at the Company\u2019s project-level entities. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company closed on its offering of $345 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Notes due 2019. The Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into the Company\u2019s common stock, cash or a combination thereof at an initial conversion price of $46.55 per share of Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately 21.4822 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. On August 5, 2014, NRG Yield Operating LLC issued $500 million of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at 5.375% and mature in August 2024. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2015. The Company\u2019s substantial debt could have important negative consequences on the Company\u2019s financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the Company\u2019s indebtedness, therefore reducing the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s capital stock (including the Class A common stock) or to use the Company\u2019s cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting the Company\u2019s ability to make certain distributions with respect to the Company\u2019s capital stock (including the Class A common stock) and the ability of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to make certain distributions to it, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in the Company\u2019s credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing the Company to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of the Company\u2019s borrowings, which may include borrowings under the Company\u2019s amended and restated revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to the Company\u2019s competitors who have less debt.\nThe Company's amended and restated revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company\u2019s ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interests. The Company\u2019s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants could prevent the Company from paying cash dividends, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s project-level financing contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company\u2019s project subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to the Company or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interests. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of certain financial ratios. The Company\u2019s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants may prevent cash distributions by the particular project(s) to it and, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness. If the Company is unable to make distributions from the Company\u2019s project-level subsidiaries, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nLetter of credit facilities to support project-level contractual obligations generally need to be renewed after five to seven years, at which time the Company will need to satisfy applicable financial ratios and covenants. If the Company is unable to renew the Company\u2019s letters of credit as expected or replace them with letters of credit under different facilities on favorable terms or at all, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, such inability may constitute a default under certain project-level financing arrangements, restrict the ability of the project-level subsidiary to make distributions to it and/or reduce the amount of cash available at such subsidiary to make distributions to the Company.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the Company, its partners, NRG, as the Company\u2019s principal stockholder (on a combined voting basis) and manager under the Management Services Agreement, and the regional wholesale power markets;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and the financial performance of the Company subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of acceptable project credit ratings or credit quality;\n\u2022\ncash flow; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nThe Company may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, the Company may be unable to refinance or replace project-level financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. The Company's failure, or the failure of any of the Company\u2019s projects, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of the Company's long-term bilateral contracts with state-regulated utilities could be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nA significant portion of the Company's revenues are derived from long-term bilateral contracts with state-regulated utilities. Other state-regulated contracts, to which the Company is not a party, are being challenged in federal court and have been declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the rate for energy and capacity established by the state-regulated contracts impermissibly conflict with the rate for energy and capacity established by FERC. To date, federal district courts in New Jersey and Maryland have struck down contracts on similar grounds. In 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the Maryland court decision, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the New Jersey decision. If certain of\nthe Company's state-regulated agreements with utilities are held to be invalid, the Company may be unable to replace such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe generation of electric energy from solar and wind energy sources depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions.\nIf solar or wind conditions are unfavorable, the Company's electricity generation and revenue from renewable generation facilities may be substantially below the Company's expectations. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a solar electric or wind energy generation facility is highly dependent on suitable solar or wind conditions, as applicable, and associated weather conditions, which are beyond the Company's control. Furthermore, components of the Company's systems, such as solar panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness of the Company's assets or reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of the Company's renewable assets.\nThe Company bases its investment decisions with respect to each renewable generation facility on the findings of related wind and solar studies conducted on-site prior to construction or based on historical conditions at existing facilities. However, actual climatic conditions at a facility site, particularly wind conditions, may not conform to the findings of these studies and therefore, the Company's solar and wind energy facilities may not meet anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the Company's generation assets, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOperation of electric generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operation of the Company's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. Operation of the Company's facilities also involves risks that the Company will be unable to transport its products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the business. Unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or require the Company to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward power sales obligations. The Company's inability to operate its electric generation assets efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company maintains insurance, obtains warranties from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover the Company's lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should it experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems.\nIn addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in the Company being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. The Company maintains an amount of insurance protection that it considers adequate but cannot provide any assurance that the Company's insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject. Furthermore, the Company's insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which the Company is not fully insured (which may include a significant judgment against any facility or facility operator) could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of electric generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output.\nThe Company's facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce the Company's facilities' generating capacity below expected levels, reducing the Company's revenues and jeopardizing the Company's ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock at expected levels or at all. Degradation of the performance of the Company's solar facilities above levels provided for in the related offtake agreements may also reduce the Company's revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing the Company's facilities may also reduce profitability.\nIf the Company makes any major modifications to its conventional power generation facilities, it may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the CAA in the future. Any such modifications could likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures. The Company may also choose to repower, refurbish or upgrade its facilities based on its assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such facilities require time for development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel and power prices. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCounterparties to the Company's offtake agreements may not fulfill their obligations and, as the contracts expire, the Company may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms in light of increasing competition in the markets in which the Company operates.\nA significant portion of the electric power the Company generates is sold under long-term offtake agreements with public utilities or industrial or commercial end-users, with a weighted average remaining duration of approximately 16 years (based on net capacity under contract). As of December 31, 2014, the largest customers of the Company's power generation assets, including assets in which the Company has less than a 100% membership interest, were SCE, PG&E and CL&P, which represented 52%, 32% and 6% respectively, of the net electric generation capacity of the Company's facilities.\nIf, for any reason, any of the purchasers of power under these agreements are unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or if they refuse to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder or if they otherwise terminate such agreements prior to the expiration thereof, the Company's assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, to the extent any of the Company's power purchasers are, or are controlled by, governmental entities, the Company's facilities may be subject to legislative or other political action that may impair their contractual performance.\nThe power generation industry is characterized by intense competition and the Company's electric generation assets encounter competition from utilities, industrial companies and other independent power producers, in particular with respect to uncontracted output. In recent years, there has been increasing competition among generators for offtake agreements and this has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets characterized by excess supply above designated reserve margins. In light of these market conditions, the Company may not be able to replace an expiring or terminated agreement with an agreement on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. In addition, the Company believes many of its competitors have well-established relationships with the Company's current and potential suppliers, lenders, customers and have extensive knowledge of its target markets. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements than the Company will be able to. Adoption of technology more advanced than the Company's could reduce its competitors' power production costs resulting in their having a lower cost structure than is achievable with the technologies currently employed by the Company and adversely affect its ability to compete for offtake agreement renewals. If the Company is unable to replace an expiring or terminated offtake agreement, the affected facility may temporarily or permanently cease operations. External events, such as a severe economic downturn, could also impair the ability of some counterparties to the Company's offtake agreements and other customer agreements to pay for energy and/or other products and services received.\nThe Company's inability to enter into new or replacement offtake agreements or to compete successfully against current and future competitors in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of the Company's assets operate, wholly or partially, without long-term power sale agreements.\nThe generation capacity of the Company\u2019s Dover and Paxton thermal generation assets has been sold through May 2018 in the annual Base Residual Auction, or BRA, under the PJM-administered RPM. Capacity revenue beginning in June 2018 is not yet determined. These facilities do not have offtake agreements for energy sales and sell energy through NRG Power Marketing LLC, an NRG affiliate, into the bid-based auction market for energy administered by PJM based on economic dispatch of their units. If the Company is unable to sell available capacity from those facilities beginning in June 2018 through the BRA or one of the other RPM capacity auctions or is unable to enter into a offtake agreement or otherwise sell unallocated or unsold capacity at favorable terms, there may be a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the Alta X and XI facilities will operate as merchant facilities without long-term power sales agreements for 2015, and therefore are exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements for these assets, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plant and equipment, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nA portion of the steam and chilled water produced by the Company's thermal assets is sold at regulated rates, and the revenue earned by the Company's GenConn assets is established each year in a rate case; accordingly, the profitability of these assets is dependent on regulatory approval.\nApproximately 375 net MWt of capacity from certain of the Company's thermal assets are sold at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission for the thermal assets. Similarly, the revenues related to approximately 380 MW of capacity from the GenConn assets are established each year by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. While such regulatory oversight is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that the Company may charge, or the revenue that the Company may earn with respect to this capacity are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of the costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates or revenues are determined will always result in rates or revenues that achieve full recovery of costs or an adequate return on the Company's capital investments. While the Company's rates and revenues are generally established based on an analysis of costs incurred in a base year, the rates the Company is allowed to charge, and the revenues the Company is authorized to earn, may or may not match the costs at any given time. If the Company's costs are not adequately recovered through these regulatory processes, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSupplier and/ or customer concentration at certain of the Company's facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\nThe Company often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel, equipment, technology and/or other services required for the operation of certain facilities. In addition, certain of the Company's suppliers provide long-term warranties with respect to the performance of their products or services. If any of these suppliers cannot perform under their agreements with the Company, or satisfy their related warranty obligations, the Company will need to utilize the marketplace to provide or repair these products and services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these products and services as, when and where required. The Company may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on favorable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to enter into replacement agreements to provide for fuel, equipment, technology and other required services, it would seek to purchase the related goods or services at market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price. The Company may also be required to make significant capital contributions to remove, replace or redesign equipment that cannot be supported or maintained by replacement suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, credit support terms and cash flows.\nIn addition, potential or existing customers at the Company\u2019s district energy centers and combined heat and power plants, or the Energy Centers, may opt for on-site systems in lieu of using the Company\u2019s Energy Centers, either due to corporate policies regarding the allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site, or otherwise. At times, the Company relies on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility.\nThe failure of any supplier to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Company or the Company\u2019s loss of potential or existing customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, the Company's suppliers and vendors and the Company\u2019s ability to solicit and retain customers.\nThe Company currently owns, and in the future may acquire, certain assets in which the Company has limited control over management decisions and its interests in such assets may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions.\nThe Company has limited control over the operation of GenConn, Avenal and CVSR because the Company beneficially owns 49.95%, 49.95% and 48.95%, respectively, of the membership interests in such assets. The Company may seek to acquire additional assets in which it owns less than a majority of the related membership interests in the future. In these investments, the Company will seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of assets in which it owns less than a majority of the membership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. The Company may be dependent on its co-venturers to operate such assets. The Company's co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between the Company and its stockholders, on the one hand, and the Company's co-venturers, on the other hand, where the Company's co-venturers' business interests are inconsistent with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Further, disagreements or disputes between the Company and its co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase expenses and potentially limit the time and effort the Company's officers and directors are able to devote to the business.\nThe approval of co-venturers also may be required for the Company to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey its interest in such assets, or for the Company to acquire NRG's interests in such co-ventures as an initial matter. Alternatively, the Company's co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of the Company's interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for interests in such assets, in the event the Company wants to sell such interests.\nFurthermore, certain of the Company's facilities are operated by third-party operators, such as First Solar. To the extent that third-party operators do not fulfill their obligations to manage operations of the facilities or are not effective in doing so, the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's assets are exposed to risks inherent in the use of interest rate swaps and forward fuel purchase contracts and the Company may be exposed to additional risks in the future if it utilizes other derivative instruments.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. In addition, the Company uses forward fuel purchase contracts to hedge its limited commodity exposure with respect to the Company's district energy assets. If the Company elects to enter into such commodity hedges, the related asset could recognize financial losses on these arrangements as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. If actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources are not available, the valuation of these contracts would involve judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. If the values of these financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's business is subject to restrictions resulting from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, the Company may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property where there has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether the Company knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed an affected property's value, the Company could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws provide for the creation of a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government as security for damages and any costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination and associated clean-up. Although the Company generally requires its operators to undertake to indemnify it for environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the operator to indemnify the Company. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the Company's ability to operate the business.\nThe Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation or thermal assets are located, which could result in disruption to its operations.\nThe Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation or thermal assets are located and the Company is, therefore, subject to the possibility of less desirable terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid leases or rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Although the Company has obtained rights to construct and operate these assets pursuant to related lease arrangements, the rights to conduct those activities are subject to certain exceptions, including the term of the lease arrangement. The loss of these rights, through the Company's inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, may adversely affect the Company's ability to operate its generation and thermal infrastructure assets.\nThe electric generation business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements.\nThe Company's electric generation business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services. Except for generating facilities within the footprint of ERCOT which are regulated by the PUCT, all of the Company\u2019s assets make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services in interstate commerce and are public utilities for purposes of the FPA, unless otherwise exempt from such status. FERC's orders that grant market-based rate authority to wholesale power marketers reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines that the seller can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, public utilities are subject to FERC reporting requirements that impose administrative burdens and that, if violated, can expose the company to criminal and civil penalties or other risks.\nThe Company's market-based sales will be subject to certain rules prohibiting manipulative or deceptive conduct, and if any of the Company's generating companies are deemed to have violated those rules, they will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, suspension or revocation of market based rate authority. If such generating companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost- based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates the Company is able to charge for power from its facilities.\nMost of the Company's assets are operating as EWGs as defined under the PUHCA, or QFs as defined under the PURPA, as amended, and therefore are exempt from certain regulation under the PUHCA and the PURPA. If a facility fails to maintain its status as an EWG or a QF or there are legislative or regulatory changes revoking or limiting the exemptions to the PUHCA, then the Company may be subject to significant accounting, record-keeping, access to books and records and reporting requirements and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of penalties and additional compliance obligations.\nSubstantially all of the Company's generation assets are also subject to the reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (currently the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC) and approved by FERC. If the Company fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. The Company will also be affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing regional markets operated by RTOs or ISOs, such as PJM. The RTOs/ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the Company's generation facilities acquired in the future that sell energy, capacity and ancillary products into the wholesale power markets. The regulatory environment for electric generation has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission assets. These changes are ongoing and the Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Company's business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed to re-regulate the markets or require divestiture of electric generation assets by asset owners or operators to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company's business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on its operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination.\nThe Company's assets are subject to numerous and significant federal, state and local laws, including statutes, regulations, guidelines, policies, directives and other requirements governing or relating to, among other things: protection of wildlife, including threatened and endangered species; air emissions; discharges into water; water use; the storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous, residual and other regulated materials, such as chemicals; the prevention of releases of hazardous materials into the environment; the prevention, presence and remediation of hazardous materials in soil and groundwater, both on and offsite; land use and zoning matters; and workers' health and safety matters. The Company's facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels and result in personal injury, penalties and property damage. As such, the operation of the Company's facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities (including potential civil actions, compliance or remediation orders, fines and other penalties), and may result in the assets being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. The Company has implemented environmental, health and safety management programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to continue. Significant costs may be incurred for capital expenditures under environmental programs to keep the assets compliant with such environmental laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, it may be necessary to retire or mothball facilities or restrict or modify the Company's operations to comply with more stringent standards. These environmental requirements and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks that are beyond the Company's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's generation facilities that were acquired or those that the Company otherwise acquires or constructs and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage.\nFurthermore, certain of the Company's power generation thermal assets are located in active earthquake zones in California and Arizona, and certain project companies and suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters. In addition, California and some of the locations where certain suppliers are located, from time to time, have experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting the Company or its suppliers, could cause a significant interruption in the business, damage or destroy the Company's facilities or those of its suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of the Company's suppliers. Any such terrorist acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions or natural disasters could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment regulations providing incentives for renewable generation could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact the Company's growth strategy.\nThe Company's growth strategy depends in part on government policies that support renewable generation and enhance the economic viability of owning renewable electric generation assets. Renewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as ITCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS, programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provides an ITC of 30% of the cost-basis of an eligible resource, including solar energy facilities placed in service prior to the end of 2016, which percentage is currently scheduled to be reduced to 10% for solar energy systems placed in service after December 31, 2016.\nMany states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. However, the regulations that govern the RPS programs, including pricing incentives for renewable energy, or reasonableness guidelines for pricing that increase valuation compared to conventional power (such as a projected value for carbon reduction or consideration of avoided integration costs), may change. If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future growth prospects.\nSuch material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. Furthermore, the ARRA included incentives to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, such as cash grants in lieu of ITCs, bonus depreciation and expansion of the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program. It is uncertain what loan guarantees may be made by the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program in the future. In addition, the cash grant in lieu of ITCs program only applies to facilities that commenced construction prior to December 31, 2011, which commencement date may be determined in accordance with the safe harbor if more than 5% of the total cost of the eligible property was paid or incurred by December 31, 2011.\nIf the Company is unable to utilize various federal, state and local government incentives to acquire additional renewable assets in the future, or the terms of such incentives are revised in a manner that is less favorable to the Company, it may suffer a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies on electric interconnection and transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's regions. If these facilities fail to provide the Company with adequate transmission capacity, it may be restricted in its ability to deliver electric power to its customers and may either incur additional costs or forego revenues.\nThe Company depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power it will sell from its electric generation assets to its customers. A failure or delay in the operation or development of these interconnection or transmission facilities or a significant increase in the cost of the development of such facilities could result in lost revenues. Such failures or delays could limit the amount of power the Company's operating facilities deliver or delay the completion of the Company's construction projects. Additionally, such failures, delays or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. If a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, the Company's recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have a sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The Company also cannot predict whether interconnection and transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. In addition, certain of the Company's operating facilities' generation of electricity may be curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations or limitations on the electricity grid's ability to accommodate intermittent electricity generating sources, reducing the Company's revenues and impairing its ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility's generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, economic congestion on transmission networks in certain of the markets in which the Company operates may occur and the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs. If the Company were liable for such congestion costs, its financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the disruption of the fuel supplies necessary to generate power at its conventional and thermal power generation facilities.\nDelivery of fossil fuels to fuel the Company's conventional and thermal generation facilities is dependent upon the infrastructure (including natural gas pipelines) available to serve each such generation facility as well as upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at these generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\nRisks Related to the Relationship with NRG\nNRG is the Company's controlling stockholder and exercises substantial influence over the Company. The Company is highly dependent on NRG.\nNRG owns all of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to one vote per share. As a result of its ownership of the Class B common stock, NRG owns 55.3% of the combined voting power of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock as of December 31, 2014. NRG has also expressed its intention to maintain a controlling interest in the Company. As a result of this ownership, NRG has a substantial influence on the Company's affairs and its voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of the Company's stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of the Company's stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or discouraging others from making tender offers for their shares. In addition, NRG will have the right to appoint all of the Company's directors. NRG may cause corporate actions to be taken even if their interests conflict with the interests of the Company's other stockholders (including holders of the Company's Class A common stock).\nFurthermore, the Company depends on the management and administration services provided by or under the direction of NRG under the Management Services Agreement. NRG personnel and support staff that provide services to the Company under the Management Services Agreement are not required to, and the Company does not expect that they will, have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of the Company or to act exclusively for the Company and the Management Services Agreement does not require any specific individuals to be provided by NRG. Under the Management Services Agreement, NRG has the discretion to determine which of its employees perform assignments required to be provided to the Company. Any failure to effectively manage the Company's operations or to implement its strategy could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Management Services Agreement will continue in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe Company also depends upon NRG for the provision of management and administration services at all of the Company's facilities. Any failure by NRG to perform its requirements under these arrangements or the failure by the Company to identify and contract with replacement service providers, if required, could adversely affect the operation of the Company's facilities and have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may not be able to consummate future acquisitions from NRG.\nThe Company's ability to grow through acquisitions depends, in part, on NRG's ability to identify and present the Company with acquisition opportunities. NRG established the Company to hold and acquire a diversified suite of power generating assets in the United States and its territories. Although NRG has agreed to grant the Company a right of first offer with respect to certain power generation assets that NRG may elect to sell in the future, NRG will be under no obligation to sell the NRG ROFO Assets or the EME-NYLD-Eligible Assets or to accept any related offer from us. Furthermore, NRG has no obligation to source acquisition opportunities specifically for the Company. In addition, NRG has not agreed to commit any minimum level of dedicated resources for the pursuit of renewable power-related acquisitions. There are a number of factors which could materially and adversely impact the extent to which suitable acquisition opportunities are made available from NRG, including:\n\u2022\nthe same professionals within NRG's organization that are involved in acquisitions that are suitable for the Company have responsibilities within NRG's broader asset management business, which may include sourcing acquisition opportunities for NRG. Limits on the availability of such individuals will likewise result in a limitation on the availability of acquisition opportunities for the Company; and\n\u2022\nin addition to structural limitations, the question of whether a particular asset is suitable is highly subjective and is dependent on a number of factors including an assessment by NRG relating to the Company's liquidity position at the time, the risk profile of the opportunity and its fit with the balance of the Company's then current operations and other factors. If NRG determines that an opportunity is not suitable for the Company, it may still pursue such opportunity on its own behalf, or on behalf of another NRG affiliate.\nIn making these determinations, NRG may be influenced by factors that result in a misalignment or conflict of interest.\nThe departure of some or all of NRG's employees could prevent the Company from achieving its objectives.\nThe Company depends on the diligence, skill and business contacts of NRG's professionals and the information and opportunities they generate during the normal course of their activities. Furthermore, approximately 31% of NRG's employees at the Company generation plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2014. The Company's future success will depend on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with NRG, or otherwise successfully renegotiate their collective bargaining agreements when such agreements expire or otherwise terminate. NRG has experienced departures of key professionals and personnel in the past and may do so in the future, and the Company cannot predict the impact that any such departures will have on its ability to achieve its objectives. The departure of a significant number of NRG's professionals or a material portion of the NRG employees who work at any of the Company's facilities for any reason, or the failure to appoint qualified or effective successors in the event of such departures, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to achieve its objectives. The Management Services Agreement does not require NRG to maintain the employment of any of its professionals or to cause any particular professional to provide services to the Company or on its behalf.\nThe Company's organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interests of the Company or the best interests of holders of its Class A common stock and that may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between the Company and holders of its Class A common stock, on the one hand, and NRG, on the other hand. The Company has entered into a Management Services Agreement with NRG. Each of the Company's executive officers are a shared NRG executive and devote his or her time to both the Company and NRG as needed to conduct the respective businesses pursuant to the Management Services Agreement. Although the Company's directors and executive officers owe fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders, these shared NRG executives have fiduciary and other duties to NRG, which duties may be inconsistent with the Company's best interests and holders of the Company's Class A common stock. In addition, NRG and its representatives, agents and affiliates have access to the Company's confidential information. Although some of these persons are subject to confidentiality obligations pursuant to confidentiality agreements or implied duties of confidence, the Management Services Agreement does not contain general confidentiality provisions.\nAdditionally, all of the Company's executive officers continue to have economic interests in NRG and, accordingly, the benefit to NRG from a transaction between the Company and NRG will proportionately inure to their benefit as holders of economic interests in NRG. NRG is a related party under the applicable securities laws governing related party transactions and may have interests which differ from the Company's interests or those of holders of the Class A common stock, including with respect to the types of acquisitions made, the timing and amount of dividends by the Company, the reinvestment of returns generated by the Company's operations, the use of leverage when making acquisitions and the appointment of outside advisors and service providers. Any material transaction between the Company and NRG will be subject to the Company's related party transaction policy, which will require prior approval of such transaction by the Company's corporate committees. Those of the Company's executive officers who have economic interests in NRG may be conflicted when advising the Company's corporate committees or otherwise participating in the negotiation or approval of such transactions. These executive officers have significant project- and industry-specific expertise that could prove beneficial to the Company's decision-making process and the absence of such strategic guidance could have a material adverse effect on the corporate committees' ability to evaluate any such transaction. Furthermore, the creation of corporate committees and the Company's related party transaction approval policy may not insulate the Company from derivative claims related to related party transactions and the conflicts of interest described in this risk factor. Regardless of the merits of such claims, the Company may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources in the defense thereof. Additionally, to the extent the Company fails to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact the Company's reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with the Company, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable or unwilling to terminate the Management Services Agreement.\nThe Management Services Agreement provides that the Company may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to NRG upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) NRG defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained therein in a manner that results in material harm to the Company and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof is given to NRG; (ii) NRG engages in any act of fraud, misappropriation of funds or embezzlement that results in material harm to the Company; (iii) NRG is grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the agreement and such negligence results in material harm to the Company; or (iv) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of NRG. Furthermore, if the Company requests an amendment to the scope of services provided by NRG under the Management Services Agreement and is not able to agree with NRG as to a change to the service fee resulting from a change in the scope of services within 180 days of the request, the Company will be able terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior notice to NRG. The Company will not be able to terminate the agreement for any other reason, including if NRG experiences a change of control, and the agreement continues in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. If NRG's performance does not meet the expectations of investors, and the Company is unable to terminate the Management Services Agreement, the market price of the Class A common stock could suffer.\nIf NRG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all.\nThe Company relies on NRG to provide it with management services under the Management Services Agreement and will not have independent executive or senior management personnel. The Management Services Agreement provides that NRG may terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice of termination to the Company if it defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the agreement in a manner that results in material harm and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice of the breach is given. If NRG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, in light of NRG's familiarity with the Company's assets, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of service due to lack of pre-existing synergies. If the Company cannot locate a service provider that is able to provide substantially similar services as NRG does under the Management Services Agreement on similar terms, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe liability of NRG is limited under the Company's arrangements with it and the Company has agreed to indemnify NRG against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead it to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to the Company than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, NRG does not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the Management Services Agreement in good faith. In addition, under the Management Services Agreement, the liability of NRG and its affiliates will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify NRG to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with the Company's operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the Management Services Agreement or the services provided by NRG, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in NRG tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise would be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which NRG is a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification that are adverse to the Company and holders of its common stock.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in the Company\nThe Company may not be able to continue paying comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of its common stock in the future.\nThe amount of cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash the Company generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital expenditures the Company makes;\n\u2022\nthe completion of ongoing construction activities on time and on budget;\n\u2022\nthe level of operating and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to NRG for services provided to the Company in accordance with the Management Services Agreement;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in revenues generated by the business;\n\u2022\ndebt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in working capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe Company's ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in the Company's debt agreements (including project-level financing and the Company's revolving credit facility); and\n\u2022\nother business risks affecting cash levels.\nAs a result of all these factors, the Company cannot guarantee that it will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of its common stock. Furthermore, holders of the Company's common stock should be aware that the amount of cash available for distribution depends primarily on cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items.\nThe Company may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate its cash available for distribution and, in turn, impair its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's common stock during the period. Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to pay dividends on the Company's common stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing project-level financing. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities prior to COD and thereafter prohibit distributions to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios. The Company's amended and restated revolving credit facility will also restrict the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or if the payment of the dividend would result in an event of default.\nNRG Yield LLC's cash available for distribution will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in some cases significantly, due to seasonality. As result, the Company may cause NRG Yield LLC to reduce the amount of cash it distributes to its members in a particular quarter to establish reserves to fund distributions to its members in future periods for which the cash distributions the Company would otherwise receive from NRG Yield LLC would otherwise be insufficient to fund its quarterly dividend. If the Company fails to cause NRG Yield LLC to establish sufficient reserves, the Company may not be able to maintain its quarterly dividend with a respect to a quarter adversely affected by seasonality.\nFinally, dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be paid at the discretion of the Company's board of directors. The Company's board of directors may decrease the level of or entirely discontinue payment of dividends.\nThe Company is a holding company and its only material asset is its interest in NRG Yield LLC, and the Company is accordingly dependent upon distributions from NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses.\nThe Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in NRG Yield LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in NRG Yield Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are the project companies. None of the Company, NRG Yield LLC or NRG Yield Operating LLC has any independent means of generating revenue. The Company intends to cause NRG Yield Operating LLC's subsidiaries to make distributions to NRG Yield Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to NRG Yield LLC, and, in turn, to make distributions to the Company in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by the Company. To the extent that the Company needs funds for a quarterly cash dividend to holders of the Company's common stock or otherwise, and NRG Yield Operating LLC or NRG Yield LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of NRG Yield Operating LLC's operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions), it could materially adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition and limit the Company's ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company has a limited operating history and as a result there is no assurance the Company can operate on a profitable basis.\nThe Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operation. The Company cannot assure investors that it will be successful in addressing the risks the Company may encounter, and the Company's failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the value of the Company's Class A common stock.\nOne of the factors that will influence the price of shares of the Company's Class A common stock will be the effective dividend yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of the Company's shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead investors of shares of the Company's Class A common stock to expect a higher dividend yield and the Company's inability to increase its dividend as a result of an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient cash available for distribution or otherwise, could result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of the Company's Class A common stock as investors seek alternative investments with higher yield.\nIf the Company is deemed to be an investment company, the Company may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and the Company's activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for the Company to complete strategic acquisitions or effect combinations.\nIf the Company is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act, the Company's business would be subject to applicable restrictions under the Investment Company Act, which could make it impracticable for the Company to continue its business as contemplated.\nThe Company believes it is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because the Company is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. The Company intends to conduct its operations so that the Company will not be deemed an investment company. However, if the Company were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on the Company's capital structure and the Company's ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for the Company to continue its business as contemplated.\nMarket volatility may affect the price of the Company's Class A common stock.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which the Company cannot predict or control, including general market and economic conditions, disruptions, downgrades, credit events and perceived problems in the credit markets; actual or anticipated variations in its quarterly operating results or dividends; changes in the Company's investments or asset composition; write-downs or perceived credit or liquidity issues affecting the Company's assets; market perception of NRG, the Company's business and the Company's assets; the Company's level of indebtedness and/or adverse market reaction to any indebtedness that the Company may incur in the future; the Company's ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all; loss of any major funding source; the termination of the Management Services Agreement or additions or departures of NRG's key personnel; changes in market valuations of similar power generation companies; and speculation in the press or investment community regarding the Company or NRG.\nSecurities markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's Class A common stock.\nThe Company is a \"controlled company,\" controlled by NRG, whose interest in the Company's business may be different from the holders of the Company's common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, NRG controls 55.3% of the Company's combined voting power and is able to elect all of the Company's board of directors. As a result, the Company is considered a \"controlled company\" for the purposes of the NYSE listing requirements. As a \"controlled company,\" the Company is permitted to, and the Company may, opt out of the NYSE listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors to be independent, (ii) that the Company establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or (iii) that the compensation of the Company's executive officers and nominees for directors are determined or recommended to the Company's board of directors by the independent members of the Company's board of directors. The NYSE listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors.\nProvisions of the Company's charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of the Company's Class A common stock, and could make it more difficult to change management.\nProvisions of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that holders of the Company's Class A common stock may consider favorable, including transactions in which such stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. This is because these provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace or remove members of the Company's management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called upon a resolution approved by a majority of the Company's directors then in office;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nSection 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person that together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Additionally, the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person and any of its associate or affiliate companies in the aggregate, public utility or holding company from acquiring, other than secondary market transactions, an amount of the Company's Class A common stock sufficient to result in a transfer of control without the prior written consent of the Company's board of directors. Any such change of control, in addition to prior approval from the Company's board of directors, would require prior authorization from FERC. Similar restrictions may apply to certain purchasers of the Company's securities which are holding companies regardless of whether the Company's securities are purchased in offerings by the Company or NRG, in open market transactions or otherwise. A purchaser of the Company's securities which is a holding company will need to determine whether a given purchase of the Company's securities may require prior FERC approval.\nInvestors may experience dilution of ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of the Company's Class A common stock.\nThe Company is in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of the Company's business, future acquisitions or to support the Company's projected capital expenditures. As a result, the Company may require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of the Company's business. In the future, the Company may issue the Company's previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of the Company's Class A common stock offered hereby. Under the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 500,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by the Company's board of directors. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, the Company's business or the Company's market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company's Class A common stock adversely, the stock price and trading volume of the Company's Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company's Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, the Company's business, the Company's market or the Company's competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding the Company's Class A common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company's competitors, the price of the Company's Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of the Company's Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of the Company's common stock by NRG may cause the price of the Company's Class A common stock to fall.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales by NRG of such shares (issuable to NRG upon the exchange of some or all of its NRG Yield LLC Class B units) in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A common stock may also decline as a result of NRG disposing or transferring some or all of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock, which disposals or transfers would reduce NRG's ownership interest in, and voting control over the Company. These sales might also make it more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities at a time and price that the Company deems appropriate. NRG and certain of its affiliates have certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of the Company's Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of NRG Yield LLC's Class B units. The presence of additional shares of the Company's Class A common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company's securities.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nThe Company's future tax liability may be greater than expected if the Company does not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income.\nThe Company expects to generate NOLs and NOL carryforwards that it can utilize to offset future taxable income. Based on the Company's current portfolio of assets, which include renewable assets that benefit from an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and subject to potential tax audits, which may result in income, sales, use or other tax obligations, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income tax for a period of approximately ten years. While the Company expect these losses will be available to the Company as a future benefit, in the event that they are not generated as expected, successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise) or subject to future limitations as discussed below, the Company's ability to realize these benefits may be limited. A reduction in the Company's expected NOLs, a limitation on the Company's ability to the use such losses or future tax audits, may result in a material increase in the Company's estimated future income tax liability and may negatively impact the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Company's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nThe Company's ability to the use NOLs generated in the future could be substantially limited if the Company were to experience an \"ownership change\" as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \"ownership change\" would occur if the Company's \"5-percent shareholders,\" as defined under Section 382 of the Code, collectively increased their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change deferred tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Future sales of the Company's Class A common stock by NRG, as well as future issuances by the Company, could contribute to a potential ownership change.\nA valuation allowance may be required for the Company's deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's expected NOLs will be reflected as a deferred tax asset as they are generated until utilized to offset income. Valuation allowances may need to be maintained for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels and based on input from the Company's auditors, tax advisors or regulatory authorities. In the event that the Company were to determine that the Company would not be able to realize all or a portion of the Company's net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations and the Company's ability to maintain profitability.\nDistributions to holders of the Company's Class A common stock may be taxable as dividends.\nIt is difficult to predict whether the Company will generate earnings or profits as computed for federal income tax purposes in any given tax year. If the Company makes distributions from current or accumulated earnings and profits as computed for federal income tax purposes, such distributions will generally be taxable to holders of the Company's Class A common stock in the current period as ordinary dividend income for federal income tax purposes. Under current law, such dividends would be eligible for the lower tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income of non-corporate taxpayers. While the Company expects that a portion of its distributions to holders of the Company's Class A common stock may exceed the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits as computed for federal income tax purposes and therefore constitute a non-taxable return of capital distribution to the extent of a stockholder's basis in the Company's Class A common stock, no assurance can be given that this will occur.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K of NRG Yield, Inc., or the Company, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
