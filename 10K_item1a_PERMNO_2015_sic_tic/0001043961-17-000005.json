{"cik": "1043961", "company": "TRANSGENOMIC INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have experienced annual losses from continuing operations since inception of our operations. Our operating loss from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $7.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively. These historical losses have been due principally to the expenses that we have incurred in order to develop and market our products, the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs and merger and acquisition costs.\nRecurring operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses and have used cash in our operating activities for the past several years. As of December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of approximately $19.3 million.\nThe audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 states that our independent registered public accounting firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December 31, 2016 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next 12 month period from issuance of the Form 10-K. If that is the case, and if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 month period from issuance of the Form 10-K. Our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon a combination of completing our planned merger with Precipio, generating additional revenue, improving cash collections, potentially selling underutilized assets and/or product lines related to discontinued operations and, if needed, raising necessary financing to meet our obligations and pay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that we will complete the merger in a timely manner or at all. The merger agreement is subject to many closing conditions and termination rights. We also cannot be certain that additional financing, if needed, will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could limit our ability to continue its operations.\nWe have substantial debt and other financial obligations and we may incur even more debt, and we are in default under our loan agreement with affiliates of Third Security, LLC, which means that the lenders under the loan agreement have the right to cease making additional advances, accelerate repayment of all sums due and take action to collect the amounts owed to them, including foreclosing on their security interest, each of which could adversely affect us.\nOur revolving line of credit and term loan with affiliates of Third Security, LLC, a related party (the \u201cLenders\u201d), are governed by a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d), which contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2016, we had borrowings of $7.2 million under the Loan and Security Agreement. Under the term loan, we agreed not to (i) pledge or otherwise encumber our assets other than to the Lenders, (ii) enter into additional borrowings or guarantees, (iii) repurchase our capital stock, or (iv) enter into certain mergers or acquisitions without the Lenders\u2019 consent. To secure the repayment of amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit and term loan, we granted the Lenders a security interest in all of our assets. As of December 31, 2016, we were not in compliance with the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by the Ninth Amendment, due to the fact that we did not make the required monthly interest payments during the third and fourth quarter and had not received a waiver for the non-compliance.\nOn February 2, 2017, Transgenomic entered into the Termination and Tenth Amendment (the \u201cLoan Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Loan and Security Agreement. The Loan Agreement Amendment, among other things, (i) provides that the Lenders will waive specified events of default under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement until the effective time of the Merger (or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms), (ii) provides for the conversion of all outstanding indebtedness owed to the Lenders under the Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness\u201d) into shares of Transgenomic common stock and preferred stock (collectively, the \u201cConversion Shares\u201d) effective as of the closing date of the Merger and (iii) the termination of the Loan Documents (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) and the termination and release of all security interests and liens of the Lenders in the Collateral (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) in each case immediately following the conversion of the Outstanding Indebtedness into Conversion Shares.\nThe effectiveness of certain provisions in the Loan Agreement Amendment, including provisions relating to conversion of the Conversion Shares and termination of the Loan Documents, is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the Merger, and, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, these provisions in the Loan Agreement Amendment will terminate.\nAs noted above, in connection with the Loan Agreement Amendment, the Lenders have agreed to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Loan and Security Agreement into (i) approximately 10.4 million shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger at a price equal to $0.50 per share and (ii) 24.1 million shares of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding amount owed under the Loan and Security Agreement was approximately $7.2 million of principal and $0.6 million of accrued interest. The issuance of the Conversion Shares is subject to the approval of the Transgenomic stockholders in accordance with Nasdaq Capital Market listing rules.\nThe Lenders are affiliates of Third Security, LLC, whose affiliates hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Transgenomic. Additionally, Doit L. Koppler II, a director of Transgenomic, is affiliated with Third Security, LLC and its affiliates.\nIn the event that the Merger is not consummated, we may be required to further amend our Loan and Security Agreement, refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or raise equity. Further, based upon our actual performance levels, our covenants relating to income, debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements could limit our ability to incur additional debt, which could hinder our ability to execute on our current business strategy. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations and comply with financial covenants depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance will continue to be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur existing indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry.\nWe continue to have substantial debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in our existing indebtedness and in any other agreements under which we incur indebtedness. Our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our\nbusiness and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example, our existing level of indebtedness presents the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness and the covenants within our debt instruments may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nour outstanding indebtedness may make it difficult for us to attract additional financing when needed.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nRevenue generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nExpenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\nCosts of developing new products or technologies;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nThe number and timing of strategic transactions; and\n\u2022\nWorking capital requirements related to growing existing business.\nWe may need additional capital to finance our growth or to compete, which may cause dilution to existing stockholders or limit our flexibility in conducting our business activities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund expansion, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses, technologies or services. Such additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and to the extent we engage in additional debt financing, if available, we may become subject to additional restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If additional financing is not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue as a going concern, fund our expansion, promote our brands, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures.\nGovernmental payers and health care plans have taken steps to control costs.\nMedicare, Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the costs of health care services, including clinical testing services. They may reduce fee schedules or limit/exclude coverage for certain types of tests that we perform. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, impose more stringent cost controls and reduce utilization of testing services will continue. These efforts, including changes in laws or regulations, may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWeakness in U.S. or global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nThe economies of the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business have experienced significant weakness, which, in the case of the U.S., has recently resulted in significant unemployment and slower growth in economic activity. A decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products, thus reducing our revenue. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The strengthening dollar has the potential to adversely impact U.S. businesses that operate overseas.\nSales have been variable.\nOur laboratory performs project-based work that changes from quarter to quarter. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year due to the fact that ICP is a new product and will enable the liquid biopsy market to evolve rapidly and ensure Precision Medicine is adopted globally. We see the ICP business and revenues growing as our commercial strategy is successful and our partnerships and licensing agreements become profitable.\nChanges in payer mix could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nTesting services are billed to physicians, patients, government payers such as Medicare, and insurance companies. Tests may be billed to different payers depending on a particular patient\u2019s medical insurance coverage. Government payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services as well as reimbursement for laboratory testing services. Further reductions of reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner\u2019s signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. Reimbursement for the laboratory services component of our business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. Reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third party payers may occur as well. Such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. As a result, increases in the percentage of services billed to government payers could have an adverse impact on our net sales.\nWe may experience temporary disruptions and delays in processing biological samples at our facilities.\nWe may experience delays in processing biological samples caused by software and other errors. Any delay in processing samples could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur laboratories require ongoing CLIA certification.\nThe CLIA extended federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. The CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories must also undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.\nThe sanctions for failure to comply with the CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory\u2019s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, but no assurances can be given that our laboratories will pass all future certification inspections.\nFailure to comply with HIPAA could be costly.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and associated regulations protect the privacy and security of certain patient health information and establish standards for electronic health care transactions in the United States. These privacy regulations establish federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information. Our Molecular Labs are subject to HIPAA and its associated regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our Patient Testing business. We could also incur liabilities from third party claims.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by health care reform.\nGovernment attention to the health care industry in the United States is significant and may increase. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in March 2010 could adversely impact our business. While certain portions of the legislation have already gone into effect, the ultimate impact of the legislation on the health care industry is still unknown, and the overall impact on our business is likely to be extensive and could result in significant changes to our business and our customers\u2019 businesses.\nWe are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business.\nWe are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business. In addition to the claims described in this Item 1A, we are delinquent on the payment of outstanding accounts payable amounting to approximately $0.6 million with certain of our vendors and suppliers who have taken or have threatened to take legal action to collect such outstanding amounts.\nSpecifically, on February 25, 2016, the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska (\u201cUNMC\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska for breach of contract and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to UNMC. We and UNMC entered into a settlement agreement dated February 6, 2017, which included, among other things, a mutual\ngeneral release of claims, and Transgenomic\u2019s agreement to pay $0.4 million to UNMC in installments over a period of time. The settlement amount has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016. As of March 15, 2017, Transgenomic\u2019s initial payment due to UNMC under its settlement agreement is delinquent. Transgenomic and UNMC are currently in discussions to extend the date of Transgenomic\u2019s initial payment due to UNMC.\nIn addition, on April 13, 2016, Fox Chase Cancer Center (\u201cFox Chase\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania Civil Trial Division (the \u201cCourt of Common Pleas\u201d), alleging, among other things, breach of contract, tortious interference with present and prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy and seeking punitive damages in addition to damages and other relief. This lawsuit relates to a license agreement we entered into with Fox Chase in August 2000, as amended (the \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d), as well as the assignment of certain of our rights under the License Agreement to Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (\u201cIDT\u201d), pursuant to the Surveyor Kit Patent, Technology and Inventory Purchase Agreement we entered into with IDT effective as of July 1, 2014 (the \u201cIDT Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the IDT Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IDT with respect to certain of the claims asserted in the Fox Chase proceeding. On July 8, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas sustained our preliminary objections to several of Fox Chase\u2019s claims and dismissed the claims for tortious interference, fraudulent conversion, conspiracy, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, the case has been narrowed so that only certain contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim remain pending against us. We believe that we have good and substantial defenses to the claims asserted by Fox Chase. However, there is no guarantee that we will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail.\nOn June 23, 2016, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (\u201cMount Sinai\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and, alternatively, unjust enrichment and quantum merit, and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to Mount Sinai for services rendered. We and Mount Sinai entered into a settlement agreement dated October 27, 2016, which included, among other things, a mutual general release of claims, and our agreement to pay approximately $0.7 million to Mount Sinai in installments over a period of time. The settlement amount has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016. Effective as of February 1, 2017, we and Mount Sinai agreed to amend the terms of our settlement agreement to extend the date of our initial payment due to Mount Sinai.\nOn December 19, 2016, Todd Smith filed a lawsuit against Transgenomic in the District Court of Douglas County Nebraska, alleging breach of contract and seeking recovery of $2.2 million owed by Transgenomic to Todd Smith for costs and damages arising from a breach of Transgenomic\u2019s obligations pursuant to lease agreement between the parties. Transgenomic and Todd Smith are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability.\nOn February 21, 2017, XIFIN filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court for the Southern District of California alleging breach of written contract and seeking recovery of approximately $0.27 million owed by us to XIFIN for damages arising from a breach of our obligations pursuant to a Systems Services Agreement between us and XIFIN, dated as of February 22, 2013, as amended and restated on September 1, 2014. On April 4, 2017, XIFIN filed an application for an entry of default by the clerk of the court against us. A $0.21 million liability has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.\nWe and Science Park Development Corporation (\u201cSPDC\u201d) entered into that certain Lease dated as of December 31, 2011, as modified by the First Amendment to Lease dated as of June 18, 2013, as further modified by a letter agreement dated as of February 2, 2015, as modified by the Second Amendment to Lease dated as of June 26, 2015 (the \u201cSPDC Lease\u201d). In November 2016, SPDC alleged that we defaulted on our obligations under the SPDC Lease. Specifically, SPDC alleges that we failed to pay approximately $0.4 million in rental payments due under the SPDC Lease and that we vacated a portion of the leased premises in violation of the terms of the SPDC Lease. Transgenomic and SPDC entered into a settlement agreement dated March 6, 2017, which included, among other things, a mutual general release of claims, and Transgenomic\u2019s agreement to pay approximately $0.4 million to SPDC in installments over a period of time.\nCPA Global provides us with certain patent management services. One February 6, 2017, CPA Global claimed that we owe CPA Global approximately $0.2 million for certain patent maintenance services rendered. CPA Global has not filed claims against us in connection with this allegation. A liability of approximately $0.2 million has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.\nOn March 9, 2016, counsel for EdgeBio sent a demand letter on behalf of EdgeBio to us in connection with the terms of the EdgeBio Agreement. EdgeBio alleges, among other things, that certain customers of EdgeBio erroneously remitted payments to us, that such payments should have been paid to EdgeBio and that we failed to remit these funds to EdgeBio in violation of the terms of the EdgeBio Agreement. On September 13, 2016, we received a demand for payment letter from EdgeBio\u2019s counsel alleging that the balance due to EdgeBio is approximately $0.1 million. A liability of approximately $0.1 million has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.\nOn February 17, 2017, Campbell filed a lawsuit individually and on behalf of others similarly situated against us in the District Court for the District of Nebraska alleging we have a materially incomplete and misleading proxy relating to a potential merger and that the merger agreement\u2019s deal protection provisions deter superior offers. As a result, he alleges that we have violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereafter. Although we intend to defend the lawsuit, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this case. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we are unable to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, at this time that may result from this action. In the event that a settlement is reached related to these matters, the amount of such settlement may be material to our results of operations and financial condition and may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nOur ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy. In addition, the disposition of any of the pending claims against us, in excess of recorded accruals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to client lawsuits.\nProviders of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other legal claims. Potential suits could involve claims for substantial damages. Litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and our reputation. We maintain liability insurance coverage for certain claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum recovery on individual claims and, therefore, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nOur dependence on our suppliers exposes us to certain risks.\nWe rely on various suppliers for products and materials to produce our products. In the event that they would be unable to deliver these items due to product shortages or business closures, we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner or may need to increase our prices. The current economy poses the additional risk of our suppliers\u2019 inability to continue their businesses as usual.\nOur markets are very competitive.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may enjoy other competitive advantages. This may allow them to more effectively market their products to our customers or potential customers, to develop products that make our products obsolete or to produce and sell products less expensively than us. As a result of these competitive factors, demand for and pricing of our products and services could be negatively affected.\nOur patents may not protect us from others using our technology, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nPatent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop similar or alternative products or technology, duplicate any of our products, or, if patents are issued to us, design around the patented products developed by us. Our patents or licenses could be challenged by litigation and, if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to us, our competitors could be free to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain additional patents for our technology, or if we are able to do so, patents may not provide us with adequate protection or be commercially beneficial. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits.\nWe cannot be certain that other measures taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual confidentiality provisions to protect some of our confidential and proprietary information that we are not seeking patent protection for various reasons. Such measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If such measures do not protect our rights, third parties could use our technology and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced.\nWe are dependent upon licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive.\nWe have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties. If these agreements were to terminate prematurely due to our breach of the terms of these licenses or we otherwise fail to maintain our rights to such technologies, we\nmay lose the right to manufacture or sell a substantial portion of our products. In addition, we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive. If we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies, we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive.\nThe protection of intellectual property in foreign countries is uncertain.\nA significant percentage of our sales are to customers located outside the U.S. Patent and other intellectual property laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. We may need to bring proceedings to defend our patent rights or to determine the validity of our competitors\u2019 foreign patents. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and diversion of our other efforts. Finally, some of the patent protections available to us in the U.S. are not available to us in foreign countries due to the laws of those countries.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nThere are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications submitted for technologies in, or related to, our area of business. As a result, our use of our technology could infringe patents or proprietary rights of others. This may lead others to assert patent infringement or other intellectual property claims against us. We could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against intellectual property claims by third parties. Additionally, any licenses that we might need as a result of any actual infringement might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable government laws and regulations or otherwise respond to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals that we use may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources. We cannot be certain that accidental contamination or injury will not occur. Any such accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, resulting in delays and increased costs.\nWe may issue a substantial amount of our common stock to holders of options and warrants and this could reduce the market price for our stock.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had obligations to issue 8,265,584 shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or conversion rights. The issuance of these securities may be dilutive to our current stockholders and\ncould negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and a large percentage of our shares are held by a small group of unrelated, institutional owners.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had 26,446,927 shares of common stock outstanding. The sale of a significant number of shares into the public market has the potential to cause significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock. This is particularly the case if the shares being placed into the market exceed the market\u2019s ability to absorb the stock. This presents an opportunity for short sellers to contribute to the further decline of our stock price. If there are significant short sales of our stock, the price decline that would result from this activity will cause the share price to decline more so, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the stock to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of our stock in the market. In addition, the large concentration of our shares are held by a small group of stockholders which could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market.\nWe have previously identified material weaknesses and ineffective internal controls that could impact our business and financial results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. In the course of auditing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to proper timing and recognition of revenue and the elements used in our analysis and evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that the allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonably stated. We remediated these material weaknesses in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEven effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be\nharmed, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur common stock was delisted from Nasdaq and began trading on the over-the-counter markets, which may negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOn February 22, 2017, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) suspended trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market and, in April 2017, our common stock will be delisted. Our common stock is currently trading on the over-the-counter markets, which could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. Stocks traded on the over-the-counter market generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotation, as compared to securities listed on a national securities exchange. Consequently, you may not be able to liquidate your investment in the event of an emergency or for any other reason. Some significant material adverse consequences of trading on the over-the-counter markets may include:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022\na reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for us;\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our stockholders;\n\u2022\npotential loss of confidence by partners and employees; and\n\u2022\nloss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe Merger is subject to the completion of the related private placement, which is subject to its own certain conditions, and therefore may not be completed.\nIt is a condition to the completion of the Merger that we will have consummated the related private placement. The purchase agreement for the shares of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock has not yet been entered into and the private placement is subject to due diligence and legal review. There can be no assurance that all of these conditions will be satisfied or that we will be able to consummate the private placement.\nFailure to complete the Merger, the conversion of the secured debt and the related private placement could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nAlthough we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to obtain stockholder approval of the proposal to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock in connection with the Merger, there is no assurance that these proposals will be approved. If these proposals are not approved, and as a result the Merger is not completed:\n\u2022\nOur ongoing business may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022\nWe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Precipio a termination fee of up to $256,500.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial conditions or results of operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business. Specifically:\n\u2022\nour current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following completion of the Merger, which might adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel and attract new personnel;\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the transaction; and\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention has been focused on the Merger, which may divert management\u2019s attention from our core business and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nThese disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals that may not be received.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the parties cannot complete the Merger unless they receive various consents and approvals from Nasdaq and other third parties. While we believe that we will receive the requisite approvals, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be received.\nOur stockholders will experience a significant reduction in percentage ownership and voting power with respect to the Transgenomic common stock you currently own as a result of the Merger with Precipio and the related private placement and the exercise or exchange of the Warrants.\nIn connection with the Merger, the combined company will issue approximately 160.6 million shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock, as well as approximately 24.1 million shares of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, approximately 24.1 million shares of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock and approximately 10.4 million shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock in a related private placement in exchange for certain of our indebtedness, approximately 56.2 million shares of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock to investors in a related private placement and approximately 104.4 million shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock issuable upon conversion of the combined company\u2019s preferred stock. In addition, the exercise or exchange of the Warrants will result in the issuance of 3.0 million shares of our common stock that would not have otherwise been issuable without stockholder approval. Upon completion of the Merger, the conversion of secured debt and the private placement, the existing holders of our common stock will own approximately 9% of the fully diluted combined company\u2019s common stock. Therefore, following the completion of the Merger and the private placement and the exercise or exchange of the Warrants, existing stockholders will experience a substantial reduction in their respective percentage ownership interests and effective voting power relative to their respective percentage ownership interests in our common stock and effective voting power prior to the Merger. This reduction in ownership and voting power will decrease our existing stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the election of directors and other matters. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future public financing. If and to the extent the shares are issued, existing stockholders may experience dilution in their earnings.\nWhile the Merger is pending, we will be subject to contractual limitations that could adversely affect our business.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions while the Merger is pending without Precipio\u2019s consent, including incurring indebtedness, making capital expenditures in excess of $5,000, acquiring any assets or selling, leasing or otherwise transferring any assets, and increasing in any material manner the compensation, bonuses or benefits of any directors, officers, employees, former employees or consultants, subject to certain exceptions in the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise and making other changes to our business prior to the closing of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts our ability to pursue certain alternatives to the Merger and requires us to pay a reverse termination fee to Precipio if we do.\nThe Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit or encourage or take any action to discuss or accept a competing third-party proposal. Although our Board of Directors is permitted to change its recommendation that stockholders approve the matters relating to the Merger if it determines in good faith that this action is reasonably likely to be required to comply with its fiduciary duties and certain other conditions, doing so in certain situations would require us to pay a termination fee to Precipio of $256,500. Additionally, these non-solicitation provisions could discourage a potential acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, or might result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable to Precipio in certain circumstances.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred and will incur additional substantial expenses in connection with the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed. These costs include fees for financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, filing fees and financial printing costs. If the Merger is not consummated, we will be responsible for our own expenses, which are not reimbursable in the event the Merger does not occur. Upon completion of the merger, the amount of transaction costs, including the amount of Precipio\u2019s transaction costs, will, in effect, reduce the cash reserves available for the combined company to pursue its plan of business.\nWe may not be able to complete the Merger and may elect to pursue another strategic transaction similar to the Merger or a financing, which may not occur on commercially reasonably terms or at all.\nThere is no assurance that we will complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all. The Merger Agreement is subject to many closing conditions and termination rights. If we do not complete the Merger, our Board of Directors may elect to attempt to complete another strategic transaction similar to the Merger or a financing. Such attempts will likely be costly and time consuming, and there is no assurance that a future strategic transaction or financing will occur on commercially reasonable terms or at all.", "PERMNO": 88471, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "PRPO"}
