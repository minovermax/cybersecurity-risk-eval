{"cik": "1487198", "company": "ASPEN GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following Risk Factors before deciding whether to invest in Aspen Group. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations or our financial condition. If any of the events discussed in the Risk Factors below occur, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of the common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nBecause there is strong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market and in the wake of COVID-19, our cost of acquiring students may increase and our results of operations may be harmed.\nPostsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year brick and mortar colleges as well as other for-profit schools and online not-for-profit schools. Public and private colleges and universities, as well as other for-profit schools, offer programs similar to those we offer. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions that create large endowments and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. Accordingly, public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for-profit sector. In addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities and online for-profit schools, have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including established colleges and universities that have not previously emphasized online education programs, a trend which will likely be amplified and accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Major brick and mortar universities continue to develop and advertise their online course offerings. Purdue University\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Kaplan University is a prime example of this change. Another example is Arizona State University which spends considerable sums on advertising its online degree programs in partnership with its Online Program Manager.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related regulatory and safety protocols require continued social distancing, we expect to see increased competition in the short term as traditionally on-campus universities shift to online classes, and as hybrid universities that offer licensure programs such as ours move to 100% online course offerings, including virtual immersions. For example, in addition to AGI, for-profit competitors such as Adtalem Global Education, Inc. and American Public Education, Inc., as well as public non-profit institutions, shifted their licensure program on-campus classes to 100% online classes in response to the pandemic. Because the long-term effects of COVID-19, including the widespread adoption of online learning methods employed by our competitors, remain uncertain, the resultant increase in competition may subsist beyond the pandemic.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures including price pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations and reduce our operating margins. These competitive factors could cause our enrollments, revenues and profitability to materially decrease.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic and any future public health emergencies may adversely affect our business.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant downturn to the U.S. and global economies. Any economic recession or depression that results could reduce the demand for our non-nursing graduates in the labor market, which may in turn reduce our enrollments and class starts in the future. Further, in order to comply with government mandates and to protect the safety of our students and employees, Aspen Group and its subsidiaries have implemented a remote work policy, temporarily closed physical campuses and office locations and moved to online-only classes. The transition to remote work poses operational challenges which may adversely affect our ability to manage our physical campus program, maintain student enrollment, and meet other operational objectives within the time frames or to the same extent anticipated prior to the pandemic.\nWhile our initial experience has revealed that we have not sustained any material adverse effect from the pandemic and the economic downturn, we cannot assure that this will continue. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business,\noperations and financial results remains uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that are impossible to predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and economic downturn; increased competition in the online learning sector as universities switch from a campus to an online environment; the impact on economic activity and actions taken in response, including those of lawmakers and government agencies; the impact on our employees and business partners; our ability to effectively and efficiently operate with employees working remotely and/or temporary closures of our campus locations; the ability of our students to continue to attend and pay for their courses; and the ability of our non-nursing graduates to procure employment notwithstanding the economic downturn. We cannot predict whether students will be able to continue paying tuition under our monthly payment plan at the same historical rates or if future enrollment and class starts will be reduced. Any negative effect of the pandemic on our operations, for the foregoing reasons or due to other factors which cannot be predicted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy of opening new nursing campuses, our results of operations and future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to its two existing campuses in the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Company expects to open at least two additional campuses per year in the foreseeable future. In calendar year 2020, we plan to open new campuses in Tampa, Florida and Austin, Texas. This requires us to obtain appropriate state and accrediting agency approvals and to comply with any requirements from those agencies related to a new location. Our application with the Florida Commission for Independent Education has been delayed to the Department\u2019s next scheduled meeting on July 28, 2020. Our meeting with the Texas Board of Nursing is scheduled for July 23, 2020. These state approvals must be received before we can start marketing efforts. Any further delays will delay our planned start dates. Adding new locations will also require significant financial investments, including capital improvements, human resource capabilities, and new clinical placement relationships. If we are unable to obtain the required approvals, attract sufficient additional students to new campus locations, offer programs at new campuses in a cost-effective manner, identify appropriate clinical placements, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established campuses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the event that we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations may be harmed.\nThe updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned, delayed or declined in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, a new academic program that must prepare students for gainful employment must be approved by the DOE for Title IV purposes if the institution is provisionally certified. If we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs may require us to make investments in management and faculty, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. If we are unable to increase the number of students, or offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBecause we are primarily an online provider of education, we are substantially dependent on continued growth and acceptance of online education and, if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees and courses from online institutions. If students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides necessary value, or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. Because our business model is in part based on online education, if the acceptance of online education does not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts, if those efforts are unsuccessful we may not be profitable in the future.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon our media performance, including our ability to:\n\u2022Grow our nursing programs including Aspen University\u2019s Pre-Licensure BSN hybrid online/campus program; USU\u2019s MSN-FNP program; and Aspen University\u2019s legacy Baccalaureate, Master\u2019s and Doctoral online degree programs;\n\u2022Select communities which have excess demand for nursing students interested in an on-campus model;\n\u2022Replicate the success we have had with nursing in other programs;\n\u2022Create greater awareness of our schools and our programs;\n\u2022Identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market and specific media vehicle;\n\u2022Determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022Comply with applicable laws and regulations affecting our marketing activities; and\n\u2022Effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media).\nOur marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness. If our media performance is not effective, our future results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf our assumptions with respect to our long-term accounts receivable prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to take a charge to our Allowance for Doubtful accounts and incur a material non-cash charge to earnings.\nAs a result of the growing acceptance of our monthly payment plans, our long-term accounts receivable balance has grown from $3,085,243 at April 30, 2019 to $6,701,136 at April 30, 2020. The primary component consists of students who make monthly payments over 36, 39 and 72 months. The average student completes their academic program in 30 months, therefore most of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable are short-term. However, when students graduate earlier than the 30-month average completion duration, and as students enter academic year two of USU\u2019s MSN-FNP legacy 72-month payment plan, they all transition to long-term accounts receivable when their liability increases to over $4,500. Our ability to collect the sums owed directly by students in contrast to the federal government or other third parties is directly tied to the future ability of students to pay us and their other obligations stemming from a variety of factors including the impact of the current economic decline in the United States, the students\u2019 individual and family financial conditions, including unemployment and under-employment, health issues which affect students, and/or family members and whether students continue with their courses or cease taking courses. While our management, based on its experience, makes assumptions which affect the reserves we take against our long-term accounts receivable, these assumptions may be incorrect and the above or other factors may cause us to increase our reserves and reduce the long-term accounts receivable on our balance sheet. The amount of any future reductions we take may be a non-cash material charge to future earnings.\nIf the demand for the nursing workforce decreases or the educational requirements for nurses were relaxed, our business will be adversely affected.\nAspen Group\u2019s primary focus has been the continued growth of enrollment in its nursing programs at both universities. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 85% of our active degree-seeking students were enrolled in our nursing programs. If the demand for nurses does not continue to grow (or declines) or there are changes within the healthcare industry that make the nursing occupation less attractive to learners or reduce the benefits of a bachelor\u2019s or an advanced degree, our enrollment and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlthough our management has successfully implemented a monthly payment business model, it may not be successful long-term.\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Michael Mathews, our Chief Executive Officer, we have developed a monthly payment business model designed to substantially increase our student enrollment and reduce student debt among Aspen University\u2019s and USU\u2019s student bodies. While results to date have been as anticipated, there are no assurances that this marketing campaign will continue to be successful. Among the risks are the following:\n\u2022Our ability to compete with existing online colleges which have substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and academic resources, and enhanced public reputations;\n\u2022The emergence of more successful competitors including traditional campus based universities which accelerated their online presence as a result of the pandemic;\n\u2022Factors related to our marketing, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022Limits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the incentive compensation rule;\n\u2022Performance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022Our failure to maintain accreditation or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction with our services and programs;\n\u2022Adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u2022A decline in the acceptance of online education;\n\u2022A decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs;\n\u2022Potential students may not be able to afford the monthly payments as a result of declines in the economy;\n\u2022The failure to collect our growing accounts receivable.\nIf our monthly payment plan business model does not continue to be favorably received, our revenues may not increase.\nIf we are unable to develop awareness among, and attract and retain, high quality learners to our schools, our ability to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability will be significantly impaired.\nBuilding awareness of Aspen University and USU and the programs we offer are critical to our ability to attract prospective learners. If we are unable to successfully market and advertise our educational programs, our ability to attract and enroll prospective students in such programs could be adversely affected, and consequently, our ability to increase revenue or achieve profitability could be impaired. It is also critical to our success that we convert these applicants to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these students remain active in our programs. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:\n\u2022The emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u2022Factors related to our marketing, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022Performance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022Failure to maintain accreditation or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction with our services and programs, including with our customer service and responsiveness;\n\u2022Adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors, or online or for-profit education in general;\n\u2022Price reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u2022A decline in the acceptance of online education or our degree offerings by students or current and prospective employers;\n\u2022Increased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022A decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs;\n\u2022Litigation or regulatory investigations that may damage our reputation; and\n\u2022Difficulties in executing on our strategy as a preferred provider to employers for the vertical markets we serve.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop awareness of Aspen University and USU and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain students, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability would be significantly impaired.\nBecause we rely on third parties to provide services in running our operations, if any of these parties fail to provide the agreed services at an acceptable level, it could limit our ability to provide services and/or cause student dissatisfaction, either of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in order for us to efficiently and securely operate our business including our computer network and the courses we offer to students. Any interruption in our ability to obtain the services of these or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our educational product and overall business. Generally, there are multiple sources for the services we purchase. Our business could be disrupted if we were required to replace any of these third parties, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on third-party administration and hosting of learning management system software for our online classroom, if that third-party were to cease to do business or alter its business practices and services, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate.\nOur online classrooms at Aspen University and USU employ the D2L learning management system called Brightspace. The system is a web-based portal that stores and delivers course content, provides interactive communication between students and faculty, and supplies online evaluation tools. We rely on third parties to host and help with the administration of it. We further rely on third parties, the D2L agreement and our internal staff for ongoing support and customization and integration of the system with the rest of our technology infrastructure. If D2L were unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with service, we may have difficulty maintaining the software required for our online classroom or updating it for future technological changes. Any failure to maintain our online classroom would have an adverse impact on our operations, damage our reputation and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nIf we cannot manage our growth, our results of operations may suffer and could adversely affect our ability to comply with federal regulations.\nThe growth that we have experienced as well as any future growth that we experience, may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls. We have experienced growth at Aspen University over the last several years and USU has grown significantly since we acquired it. Further, we have somewhat limited experience in managing our hybrid programs and anticipate substantial growth from this business. Managing multiple campuses in many locations will pose operational challenges which may impact our ability to manage our business with the same level of effectiveness as we achieved in fiscal year 2020. If growth negatively impacts our ability to manage our business, the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected, resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals. Future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems, particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the Higher Education Act, as administered by the DOE, including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV. If we are unable to manage our growth, we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nIf we experience system disruptions to our online computer networks, it could impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe continue to make investments to update our computer network and systems primarily to permit accelerated student enrollment and enhance our students\u2019 learning experience. We plan to make significant changes to our student systems and our accounting systems to enhance our ability to support the growth of the business, improve the visibility of program specific activities and related costs and enhance overall business intelligence to support capital allocation decision making. The performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students and manage our business. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our online classroom, damaging our reputation, and could cause a loss in enrollment. In addition, changes in systems can be disruptive, divert manage time and typically may involve bugs which causes further disruptions. Our technology infrastructure and systems could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist activities, hacking or cyber security issues and telecommunications failures.\nIf we lose the services of key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our future also depends on the continued services of Mr. Michael Mathews, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gerard Wendolowski, our Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Cheri St. Arnauld, our Chief Academic Officer; Mr. Frank Cotroneo, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Anne McNamara, our Chief Nursing Officer, all of whom are critical to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction and would also be difficult to replace. We have a $3 million key man life insurance policy on Mr. Mathews. The loss of the services of Mr. Mathews and other key individuals and the process to replace these individuals would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain our faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel, we may not be able to support our growth strategy.\nTo execute our growth strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas. If we fail to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fail to retain and motivate our existing faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed. Further, we have moved to a new hybrid model focused on using full-time faculty members in addition to adjunct or part-time faculty. These efforts may not be successful resulting in the loss of faculty and difficulties in recruiting.\nIf we or our service providers are unable to update the technology that we rely upon to offer online education, our future growth may be impaired.\nWe believe that continued growth will require our service providers to increase the capacity and capabilities of their technology infrastructure. Increasing the capacity and capabilities of the technology infrastructure will require these third parties to invest capital, time and resources, and there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment their systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth. Our service providers may also need to invest capital, time and resources to update their technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace. If they are unwilling or unable to increase the capacity of their resources or update their resources appropriately and we cannot change over to other service providers efficiently, our\nability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we experience any interruption to our technology infrastructure, it could prevent students from accessing their courses, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.\nOur computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. This problem is heightened with all of our employees working remotely who may have less security with their home Wi-Fi systems. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\nBecause the CAN-SPAM Act imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails, it could adversely impact our ability to market Aspen University\u2019s and USU\u2019s educational services, and otherwise increase the costs of our business.\nThe Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes requirements for commercial email and specifies penalties for commercial email that violates the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, the CAN-SPAM Act gives consumers the right to require third parties to stop sending them commercial email.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act covers email sent for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product, service, or Internet website. The Federal Trade Commission, a federal consumer protection agency, is primarily responsible for enforcing the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and Internet service providers also have authority to enforce certain of its provisions.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act\u2019s main provisions include:\n\u2022Prohibiting false or misleading email header information;\n\u2022Prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines;\n\u2022Ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender;\n\u2022Requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively permitted the message; and\n\u2022Requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act also prohibits unlawful acquisition of email addresses, such as through directory harvesting and transmission of commercial emails by unauthorized means, such as through relaying messages with the intent to deceive recipients as to the origin of such messages.\nViolations of the CAN-SPAM Act\u2019s provisions can result in criminal and civil penalties, including statutory penalties that can be based in part upon the number of emails sent, with enhanced penalties for commercial email companies who harvest email addresses, use dictionary attack patterns to generate email addresses, and/or relay emails through a network without permission.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act acknowledges that the Internet offers unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce, and the CAN-SPAM Act was passed, in part, to enhance the likelihood that wanted commercial email messages would be received.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act preempts, or blocks, most state restrictions specific to email, except for rules against falsity or deception in commercial email, fraud and computer crime. The scope of these exceptions, however, is not settled, and some states have adopted email regulations that, if upheld, could impose liabilities and compliance burdens in addition to those imposed by the CAN-SPAM Act.\nMoreover, some foreign countries, including the countries of the European Union, have regulated the distribution of commercial email and the online collection and disclosure of personal information. Foreign governments may attempt to apply their laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities.\nBecause we use email marketing, our requirement to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act could adversely affect our marketing activities and increase our costs.\nIf our data or our users\u2019 content is hacked, including through privacy and data security breaches, our business could be damaged, and we could be subject to liability.\nOur business is and we expect it will continue to be heavily reliant upon the Internet. Cyber security events have caused significant damage to large well-known companies. If our systems are hacked and our students\u2019 confidential information is misappropriated, we could be subject to liability.\nWe may fail to detect the existence of a breach of user content and be unable to prevent unauthorized access to user and company content. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. They may originate from less regulated third world countries where lax local enforcement and poverty create opportunities for hacking. If our security measures are breached, or our students\u2019 content is otherwise accessed through unauthorized means, or if any such actions are believed to occur, Aspen University and USU may lose existing students and/or fail to enroll new students or otherwise be materially harmed.\nOur business could be harmed by any significant disruption of service on our websites.\nBecause of the importance of the Internet to our business, in addition to cybersecurity, we face the risk that our systems will fail to function in a robust manner. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our students are dependent upon the reliable performance of our websites, including our underlying technical infrastructure. Our technical infrastructure may not be adequately designed with sufficient reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our websites are unavailable when students and professors attempt to access them, or if they experience frequent slowdowns or disruptions, we may lose students and professors.\nIf we incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online during our class discussions, it may affect our future operating results and financial condition.\nIn some instances, our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. As a result, we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.\nBecause the personal information that we or our vendors collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss, any of these factors could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Aspen University and USU use a third-party to collect and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information on our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches, restrict our use of personal information, and cause us to lose our certification to participate in the Title IV Programs. We cannot guarantee that there will not be a breach, loss or theft of personal information that we store or our third parties store. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal or administrative actions by state attorneys general, private litigants, and federal regulators and by such other international laws including the European Union\u2019s GDPR and their respective enforcement mechanisms any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf governments enact new laws to regulate Internet commerce, it may negatively affect our business.\nThe widespread use of the Internet has led and may in the future lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the U.S. and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. As well as regulations elsewhere including the European Union. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, data protection and breach copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, advertising and consumer protection, government access requests, or, new laws in one or more of these areas are enacted, it could result in proceedings, actions, or penalties against us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email, radio, telemarketing, display advertising, and social media marketing, targeted online advertisements, and postal mailings, and we are or may become subject to various laws and regulations that govern such marketing and advertising practices. A variety of federal, state, and international laws and regulations, including those enforced by various federal government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and state and local agencies, govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, and security of personal data, particularly in the context of online advertising, which we utilize to attract new students.\nThe laws and regulations which may restrict, limit or otherwise affect our advertising efforts include the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and various U.S. state laws regarding telemarketing. These laws generally impose restrictions on advertising practices, may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and governmental authorities and often require subjective interpretation, which could render our compliance efforts more challenging. We cannot guarantee our efforts to comply with these laws, rules and regulations will be successful, or, if they are successful, that the cost of such compliance will not be materially adverse to our business. If any laws, rules or regulations applicable to our advertising techniques significantly restrict our business, we may not be able to implement adequate alternative communication and marketing strategies at favorable costs or at all. Further, any non-compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may result in financial penalties or litigation, which would adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nThe use and storage of data, files, and information on our websites and those of our third-party service providers concerning, among others, student information is essential to their enrollment in our schools. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other regulations or our current practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations. We have implemented various features, integrations, and capabilities as well as contractual obligations intended to enable us to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in our collection, use, and transmittal of data, but these features do not ensure our compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy concerns. In particular, as a United States company, we may be obliged to disclose data pursuant to government requests under United States law. Compliance with such requests may be inconsistent with local laws in other countries where our students reside. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection, whether federal, state, or international, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, and business, and may result in claims, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities, students, users of our website, third party service providers, or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain types of data. Any such claims, proceedings, or actions could hurt our reputation, brand, and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, result in adverse publicity, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of students and/or third party service providers, and result in the imposition of monetary penalties.\nThe legislative and regulatory bodies or self-regulatory organizations in various jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations, or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, information security, and online advertising. For example, the GDPR, implemented on May 25, 2018 across the European Union, imposes more stringent data protection obligations on companies that process personal data in the E.U. GDPR has created new compliance obligations, requires investment into ongoing data protection activities and documentation requirements, and creates the potential for significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. In the first 20 months of the GDPR, E.U. regulators issued hundreds of fines to companies, including Google and Facebook, for over \u20ac114 million. California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process personal information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about such companies\u2019 data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights such as deletion rights, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA is the most prescriptive general privacy law in the United States and may lead to similar laws being enacted in other U.S. states or at the federal level. For example, the State of Nevada has also passed a law, which went into effect on October 1, 2019, that amends the state\u2019s online privacy law to allow consumers to submit requests to prevent websites and online service providers (\u201cOperators\u201d) from selling personally identifiable information that Operators collect through a website or online service. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many\nstate attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business model or practices, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct. In addition, any such changes could compromise our ability to develop an adequate marketing strategy and pursue our growth strategy effectively, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party \u201ccookies\u201d and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S. government has enacted legislation and regulations, and may enact further legislation or regulations in the future, that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to utilize online behavioral tracking, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could, if widely adopted, result in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. The regulation of the use of these cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could increase our costs of operations and limit our ability to acquire new students on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret or other protections. This intellectual property includes but is not limited to courseware materials, business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names, agreements and registrations to protect our intellectual property. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the U.S. to protect our rights to the mark ASPEN UNIVERSITY and the mark UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts. We cannot assure that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the U.S. or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content, and offer competing programs to ours.\nIn particular, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online resource material, quality management and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. Protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third-party.\nIf we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims, it could cause us to incur significant expenses and pay substantial damages.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing or violating their intellectual property rights. Any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from using our intellectual property that may be fundamental to our business. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation regarding the intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIf there is new tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce, this may adversely affect the commercial use of our marketing services and our financial results.\nDue to the growing budgetary problems facing state and local governments, it is possible that governments might attempt to tax our activities. New or revised tax regulations may subject us to additional sales, income and other taxes. In 2018 the United States Supreme Court ruled that states can tax the sale of goods sold to residents of their respective state. We cannot predict the effect of current or future attempts to impose taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales\nor use taxes, would likely increase the cost of doing business online which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured convertible notes, we could lose our business.\nOur obligations under our outstanding $10 million convertible notes are secured by a first priority lien in certain deposit accounts of the Company, all current and future accounts receivable of Aspen University and USU, certain of the deposit accounts of Aspen University and USU and a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of Aspen University and USU. The notes are due on January 22, 2023. The conversion feature on the convertible notes are as follows: after six months from the issuance date, the lenders have the right to convert the principal into our shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion price of $7.15 per share and the convertible notes automatically convert into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock if the average closing price of our common stock is at least $10.725 over a 20 consecutive trading day period. If an acceleration event occurs under the notes, our entire indebtedness will immediately become due and payable and, if we do not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral in which we granted a security interest to them and we could lose our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, any of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business, including our brick and mortar campuses, may experience business interruptions resulting from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires or significant power outages. In addition to our largest office facility and two campuses in Phoenix, AZ, we presently have an office in Denver, CO, and a campus in San Diego, CA in addition to our planned campuses in Florida and Texas. These events could cause us to close schools - temporarily or permanently - and could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenue to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our goodwill on our balance sheet arising from the USU acquisition becomes impaired, it would require us to record a material charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs a result of our acquisition of USU, we recorded approximately $5 million of goodwill which is currently shown as an asset on our balance sheet at April 30, 2020. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) require us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. If in the future we determine an impairment exists, we may be required to record a material charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations, including loss of access to Title IV Program funds.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by (1) the federal government through the DOE under the HEA/HEOA, (2) state regulatory bodies and (3) accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE, including DEAC, a \u201cnational accrediting agency\u201d recognized by the DOE, and WSCUC, a \u201cregional accrediting agency\u201d recognized by the DOE. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs regulate our participation in the military\u2019s tuition assistance program and the VA\u2019s veterans education benefits program, respectively. The laws, regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.\nInstitutions of higher education that grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies. In addition, in certain states, as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees, a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution. Accreditation is also required in order to\nparticipate in various federal programs, including tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces and the federal programs of student financial assistance administered pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations require accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE to review and monitor many aspects of an institution\u2019s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency\u2019s standards.\nOur operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in Title IV Programs which are administered by the DOE and include loans made directly to students by the DOE and several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the HEOA and the DOE regulations. To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. Our growth strategy is partly dependent on being able to offer financial assistance through Title IV Programs as it may increase the number of potential students who may choose to enroll in our programs. Our two highest long-term value programs, Aspen University\u2019s BSN Pre-Licensure nursing program, and USU\u2019s MSN-FNP program which only offers a monthly payment program for the first year of each program, make these students dependent upon Title IV or other payment options in order to continue their education.\nThe laws, regulations, standards, and policies of the DOE, state education agencies, and our accrediting agencies change frequently particularly when there is a change in the U.S. President. Pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, activities, receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces, our ability to participate in Title IV Programs, receipt of veterans education benefits funds, or costs of doing business. Findings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages, or subjected to fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our operations, termination of our ability to grant degrees, revocation of our accreditation, restrictions on or loss of our access to Title IV Program funds or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not maintain authorization in Colorado, Arizona and California and future states where we plan to have campuses, our operations would be curtailed, and we would not be able to grant degrees.\nAspen University is headquartered in Colorado and is authorized by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates. Aspen\u2019s BSN pre-licensure hybrid program is authorized by the Arizona Board. USU is headquartered in California and is authorized by the California Bureau to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates. If Aspen were to lose its authorization from the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, Aspen would be unable to provide educational services in Colorado and would lose its access to accreditation and eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. If Aspen were to lose its authorization from the Arizona Board, it would be unable to provide educational services in Arizona. If USU were to lose its authorization from the California Bureau, it would be unable to provide educational services in California and would lose access to accreditation and its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs.\nOur failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on education institutions operating within their boundaries. Many states assert jurisdiction over online education institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer education services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators.\nState laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. To the extent that we have obtained, or obtain in the future, state authorizations or licensure, changes in state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE. If we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. If we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, we may be the subject of injunctive actions or other penalties or fines. Loss of licensure or authorization or the failure to obtain required licensures or authorizations could prohibit us from recruiting or enrolling students in particular states, reduce significantly our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the DOE\u2019s 2016 regulations for distance education ultimately took effect on May 26, 2019. On November 1, 2019, the Department issued the Final Regulations on accreditation and the authorization of distance education, which took effect July 1, 2020. Like the 2016 regulations, the Final Regulations require us to (i) obtain authorization to offer our programs from each state where authorization is required or through participation in a reciprocity agreement, and (ii) provide specific consumer disclosures regarding our educational programs, including both general and direct disclosures to current and prospective students relating to professional licensure and whether the curriculum for on-ground and online professional licensure or certification programs meet states\u2019 educational requirements for licensure. If we fail to obtain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state, we could lose our ability to award Title IV aid to students within that state or be required to refund Title IV funds related to jurisdictions in which we failed to have state authorization. We must be able to document state approval for distance education if requested by the DOE. In addition, effective with the DOE\u2019s new state authorization regulations in effect as of July 1, 2020, the consumer disclosures required pursuant to the distance education rule are detailed and include disclosures regarding licensure and certification requirements, state authorization, student complaints, adverse actions by state and accreditation agencies, and refund policies. These disclosure requirements will require a considerable amount of data gathering needed to support such disclosures and will require our institutions to closely track where students enrolled in online programs are located during the course of their studies. These various disclosure requirements could subject us to financial penalties from the DOE and heightened the risk of potential federal and private misrepresentation claims.\nMoreover, in the event we are found not to be in compliance with a state\u2019s new or existing requirements for offering distance education within that state, the state could seek to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries, we may not be able to recruit students from that state, and we may have to cease providing service to students in that state. In addition, a state may impose penalties on an institution for failure to comply with state requirements related to an institution\u2019s activities in a state, including the delivery of distance education to persons in that state. In addition, if Aspen University is found not to be in compliance with SARA\u2019s eligibility criteria, including requirements related to financial responsibility that require institutions to maintain a composite score of 1.0 or higher, Aspen University could become ineligible to participate in SARA. If Aspen University fails to meet SARA\u2019s eligibility criteria and can no longer participate in SARA, Aspen University would need to comply with each state\u2019s requirements for offering distance education in that state, which could lead to disruptions in enrollments and operations while Aspen University obtains any necessary authorizations.\nIf our pre-licensure BSN nursing programs fail to have a required minimum pass rate on the NCLEX, it could result in sanctions and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future growth.\nOur BSN pre-licensure nursing degree program must comply with state regulations which require approval from the local nursing board and compliance with local laws and regulations. State nursing boards in the states where we currently have or plan to open pre-licensure nursing campuses require that these nursing programs have a certain minimum pass rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (the \u201cNCLEX\u201d). If the NCLEX pass rate falls below the required minimum for multiple years, our program in a state may be put on probation and ultimately terminated, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and future growth. Additionally, the BSN pre-licensure program is accredited by CCNE which has a required minimum NCLEX pass rate to maintain accreditation. If the NCLEX pass rate falls below the required minimum, our program\u2019s accreditation may be in jeopardy which would materially affect our business.\nIf the DOE determines that borrowers of federal student loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their federal student loans, our institution\u2019s repayment liability to the DOE could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.\nThe DOE\u2019s 2016 BDTR regulations as published on November 1, 2016 and put into effect by court order issued on October 16, 2018, as well as the new 2019 BDTR Rule, provide borrowers of loans under the Direct Loan program a defense against repayment under certain circumstances outlined in each rule. In the event the borrower\u2019s defense against repayment is successful, DOE has the authority to discharge all or part of the student\u2019s obligation to repay the loan and may require the institution to repay to DOE the amount of the loan to which the defense applies.\nUnder the 2016 BDTR Rule, there are three grounds for a borrower defense to repayment claim, for loans disbursed between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment. Claims based on a court judgment or claims to assert a defense against loan payments that are still due can be made any time (with no statute of limitations), while other claims (such as to recoup loan funds already repaid to DOE) must be made within six years. For loans disbursed after July 1, 2020, the basis for a BDTR claim will be limited to a misrepresentation claim, under the DOE\u2019s new definition, and generally, the claim must be made within three years of the borrower\u2019s last date of enrollment.\nClaim resolution process: The regulations call for the DOE to set up a fact-finding process to resolve claims. The structure includes providing the institution with notice and an opportunity to submit evidence. In addition, under the 2016 Rule, the DOE has also given itself authority to process claims on a group basis, and to take the initiative to create groups and include borrowers who have not filed a claim. Borrowers who file successful claims may have their loans forgiven in whole or in part, with the DOE reserving the right to calculate the amount of forgiveness in various ways. As noted above, the 2019 BDTR Rule removes the group claim option, but DOE will continue to evaluate student claims individually and make determinations about the borrower\u2019s relief.\nFor debts relieved for individual borrowers, both the 2016 and 2019 regulations give the DOE the authority to initiate a proceeding to seek repayment from the institution for any loan amounts forgiven.\nIf the DOE determines that borrowers of Direct Loan program loans who attended Aspen University or USU have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loan program loans based on our acts or omissions, the repayment liability to the DOE could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our institutions experience a \u201cfinancial trigger\u201d event as defined in either the 2016 or 2019 BDTR Rules, DOE could determine that we are not financially responsible, resulting in a requirement that we post an additional letter of credit, possible negative impacts on the status of our Title IV program participation agreement, additional reporting, growth limitations, and a change to a more stringent funding process, such as Heightened Cash Monitoring II or \u201creimbursement.\u201d\nBoth the 2016 and 2019 BDTR Rules amend the financial responsibility regulations to describe numerous operational or financial events that would potentially indicate that the institution will have difficulty meeting its financial or administrative obligations. If one of the enumerated triggering events occur, the institution is required to report to DOE according to the reporting requirements included in the regulation.\nFor certain of the triggers, the DOE will assess the potential liability or fiscal impact reported and recalculate the institution\u2019s composite score. If the institution\u2019s composite score drops below 1.0, the DOE may require the institution to provide additional surety to continue Title IV participation. The regulations also include \u201cdiscretionary trigger\u201d events or conditions that institutions must report, and which the DOE will review to determine whether they are reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the institution\u2019s fiscal or operational condition.\nIf based on these events and the DOE\u2019s assessment, it is determined that the institution is not financially responsible, DOE will require the institution to become provisionally certified and post a letter of credit in an amount specified, generally at least 10% of the Title IV funds received in the most recent fiscal year. The institution and the DOE may also agree to an offset of the institution's future Title IV funds for six to 12 months until the DOE is able to capture the amount of the surety required.\nIf Aspen University or USU were to experience an event that the DOE determines is an indication that either institution is not financially responsible, we could be forced to post letter(s) of credit and be moved to provisional certification, both of which could have a material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe 2016 BDTR Rule had included a prohibition on mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waivers as means to resolve a borrower defense-related claim (meaning related to the making of a Direct Loan or the educational services for which the Direct Loan was issued). Under the 2016 Rule, institutions were required to amend their arbitration and class action waiver agreements to include mandatory DOE language, and to provide notice to students under previous (non-compliant) versions of these agreements that the institution would not compel the borrower to arbitrate their claim or waive the right to join a class action for similar types of claims. For students who borrowed through the Direct Loan program between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, they cannot be compelled to bring an action in arbitration or waive their right to be a member of a class action lawsuit against Aspen University or USU, if the basis of the borrower\u2019s claim is rooted in the making of the Direct Loan or the educational services it paid for. In addition, under the 2016 Rule, institutions were required to report and provide DOE with arbitral and judicial records when a student files a borrower defense-related claim.\nUnder the 2019 BDTR Rule, which became effective on July 1, 2020, pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers are no longer prohibited. Institutions that opt to use these types of agreements will be required to provide \u201cplain language\u201d disclosures that explain arbitration and class action, and make those disclosures publicly available on the institution\u2019s admission webpage.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the U.S. Armed Forces and also to participate in Title IV Programs.\nAspen University is accredited by the DEAC, which is a national accrediting agency and USU is accredited by WSCUC, which is a regional accrediting agency. Both the DEAC and WSCUC are recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education for Title IV\npurposes. Accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education is required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs as well as in the tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces. The DEAC or WSCUC may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation. To remain accredited, we must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. Failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agency. The loss of accreditation would, among other things, render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the U.S. Armed Forces or Title IV Programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, although the loss of accreditation by one school would not necessarily result in the loss of accreditation by the other school, the accreditor may consider the loss of accreditation by one school as a factor in considering the on-going qualification for accreditation of the other school.\nBecause we participate in Title IV Programs, our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with Title IV Programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth.\nAspen University and USU participate in Title IV Programs. Compliance with the requirements of the Higher Education Act and Title IV Programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations, which require additional staff, contractual arrangements, systems and regulatory costs. We have a limited demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these additional regulatory requirements, the DOE could, among other things, impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate the eligibility of one or both of our schools to receive Title IV Program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and materiality and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations. In addition, the failure to comply with the Title IV Program requirements by one institution could increase the DOE's scrutiny of the other institution and could impact the other institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs.\nBecause USU is provisionally certified by the DOE, we must reestablish our eligibility and certification to participate in the Title IV Programs, and there are no assurances that the DOE will recertify us to participate in the Title IV Programs.\nAn institution generally must seek re-certification from the DOE at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors. In certain circumstances, the DOE provisionally certifies an institution to participate in Title IV Programs, such as when it is an initial participant in Title IV Programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control.\nOn May 14, 2019, United States University was granted provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and has a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020. As part of the provisional approval, USU posted a letter of credit in the amount of $255,708 which was funded by AGI. In March 2020, USU was notified that amount will be reduced to $21,857; this letter with the reduced amount will remain in effect for the duration of the provisional approval.\nUnder provisional certification, an institution must obtain prior DOE approval to add an educational program or make other significant changes and may be subject to closer scrutiny by the DOE. In addition, if the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities to comply with the Title IV requirements, the DOE may revoke the institution\u2019s certification to participate in the Title IV Programs without advance notice or opportunity to challenge the action. USU expects to be on HCM1, once formal notification is received from the DOE.\nPursuant to USU\u2019s provisional PPA, the DOE indicated that USU must agree to participate in Title IV under the HCM1 funding process; however, the DOE does retain discretion on whether or not to implement that term of the agreement. Although DOE has not, to date, notified USU that it has been placed in the HCM1 funding process, nor does the DOE\u2019s public disclosure website identify USU as being on HCM1, it is possible that prior to the end of the PPA term, the DOE may notify USU that it must begin funding under the HCM1 procedure.\nIf the DOE does not ultimately approve USU\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV Programs, USU students would no longer be able to receive Title IV Program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs or substantive change of existing programs or imposition of an additional letter of credit could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results.\nBecause the DOE may conduct compliance reviews of us, we may be subject to adverse actions and future litigation which could affect our ability to offer Title IV student loans.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of non-compliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. If the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. Even if we adequately address issues raised by any compliance review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit.\nIf the percentage of our revenues derived from Title IV Programs is too high, we could lose our ability to participate in Title IV Programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, an institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs if, on a cash accounting basis, it derives more than 90% of its fiscal year revenue from Title IV Program funds, for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is known as the 90/10 rule. Our online programs are well below this threshold due to our monthly payment plans. However, our BSN Pre-licensure hybrid campus/online nursing program tuition is too high to justify use of our monthly payment plans.\nAn institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to other conditions specified by the U.S. Secretary of Education. We must monitor compliance with the 90/10 rule by both Aspen University and USU. Failure to comply with the 90/10 rule for one fiscal year may result in restrictions on the amounts of Title IV funds that may be distributed to students; restrictions on expansion; requirements related to letters of credit or any other restrictions imposed by the DOE. Failure to comply with the 90/10 rule for one year is also considered a triggering event under the 2016 and 2019 BDTR Rules. Additionally, if we fail to comply with the 90/10 rule for two consecutive years, we will be ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and any disbursements of Title IV Program funds made while ineligible must be repaid to the DOE.\nFurther, due to scrutiny of the sector, legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that would revise the requirements of the 90/10 rule to be stricter, including proposals that would reduce the 90% maximum under the rule to 85% and/or prohibit tuition derived from military and veterans benefit programs to be considered when determining whether the institution has adequate non-Title IV revenue to meet the requirements of the rule.\nIf our competitors are subject to further regulatory claims and adverse publicity, it may affect our industry and reduce our future enrollment.\nWe are one of a number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. In recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for-profit educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and non-compliance with the DOE regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against specific companies, broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of other for-profit educational institutions, including Aspen University and USU. In addition, in recent years, reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, Congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education. For example, large competitors such as ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges sold or shut down their schools due to substantial regulatory investigations and the DOE actions. Adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for-profit school sector or regarding Aspen University or USU directly could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments, revenues and operating profit, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. Such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the DOE, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including Aspen University and USU.\nDue to new regulations or congressional action or reduction in funding for Title IV Programs, our future enrollment may be reduced and costs of compliance increased.\nThe Higher Education Act comes up for reauthorization by Congress approximately every five to six years. When Congress does not act on complete reauthorization, there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization. Additionally, Congress reviews and determines appropriations for Title IV Programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process. There is no assurance that Congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease Title IV Program\nfunds available to students, including students who attend our institutions. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV Programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment. Such a decrease in enrollment would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Congressional action may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin.\nFurther, there has been growing regulatory action and investigations of for-profit companies that offer online education. We are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by Congress or signed into law in the future. The reallocation of funding among Title IV Programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different Title IV Programs could reduce the ability of students to finance their education at our institutions and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf our efforts to comply with the DOE regulations are inconsistent with how the DOE interprets those provisions, either due to insufficient time to implement the necessary changes, uncertainty about the meaning of the rules, or otherwise, we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the DOE could impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our operations, and/or condition or terminate the eligibility of our schools to receive Title IV Program funds. We cannot predict with certainty the effect the new and impending regulatory provisions will have on our business.\nBecause we are subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely Title IV Program funds for students who stop participating before completing their educational program, our future operating results may be adversely affected.\nA school participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw or reduce their enrollment status in their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under recently effective DOE regulations, institutions that use the last day of attendance in an academically related activity must determine the relevant date based on accurate institutional records (not a student\u2019s certificate of attendance). For online classes, \u201cacademic attendance\u201d means engaging in an academically-related activity, such as participating in class through an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question; simply logging into an online class does not constitute \u201cacademic attendance\u201d for purposes of the return of funds requirements. Under the DOE regulations, late return of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution\u2019s annual compliance audit or a program review constitutes material non-compliance. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to repay Title IV funds, post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE or otherwise be sanctioned by the DOE, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations. This may have an impact on our systems, our future operations and cash flows.\nSubsequent to a compliance audit covering the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, USU recognized that it had not fully complied with all requirements for calculating and making timely returns of Title IV funds (R2T4). USU was required to post an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of 25% of the 2015 Title IV returns. An irrevocable letter of credit was established in favor of the Secretary of Education in the amount of $71,634 as a result of this finding. In the 2016 compliance audit, USU had a material finding related to the same issue and was required to maintain the irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount. USU will be required to maintain the letter of credit until it has experienced two consecutive audit periods without a repeat finding. As a result of the change of ownership, the previous letter of credit established by USU was replaced by one provided by AGI.\nIf we fail to ensure that the delivery of our distance education programs supports regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors, our distance education programs could be considered \u201ccorrespondence courses\u201d which could make those programs ineligible to participate in the Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE distinguishes between distance education and correspondence courses. Distance education involves the delivery of instruction to students who are separated from the instructor, which supports regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor. Correspondence courses do not involve regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor. An institution is not eligible to participate in the Title IV Programs if 50% or more of its students were enrolled in correspondence courses during its latest completed award year, making it important for the schools\u2019 distance education to involve regular and substantive interaction. If Aspen and USU distance education programs do not include regular and substantive interaction, they could be considered correspondence courses, and we would need to refund DOE financial aid money for those programs.\nOn April 2, 2020, the DOE issued a NPRM that proposes rules related to distance education and innovation, including revisions to the definition of \u201cdistance education.\u201d The NPRM was subject to a public comment period that concluded on May 4, 2020,\nand we cannot predict when the DOE will issue final regulations or will take effect, or whether the revised definition of \u201cdistance education\u201d will be different than in the NPRM.\nIf we fail to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility,\u201d Aspen University and USU may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or be required to post a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nTo participate in Title IV Programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE, or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions, such as additional reporting requirements or regulatory oversight, on its participation in Title IV Programs. Effective July 1, 2020, the DOE has updated the triggering events and factors it considers when evaluating whether an institution is financially responsible, which may render compliance more difficult or costly in the future. The DOE may also apply its measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to meet alternative standards for continued participation in the Title IV Programs. Any of these alternative standards would increase our costs of regulatory compliance. If we were unable to meet these alternative standards, we would lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. If we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, our students would lose access to Title IV Program funds for use in our institutions, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability,\u201d we may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV Programs. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other DOE regulations, the DOE may require the repayment of Title IV funds, transfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs. If we are found not to have satisfied the DOE\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV Program funding, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on a third-party to administer our participation in Title IV Programs, its failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause our schools to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nWe rely on third-party assistance to comply with the complex administration of participation in Title IV Programs for each of our schools. A third party assists us with administration of our participation in Title IV Programs, and if it does not comply with applicable regulations, we may be liable for its actions and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. In addition, if the third-party servicer is no longer able to provide the services to us, we may not be able to replace it in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of Title IV Programs, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operation.\nIf we pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in recruiting, admissions or financial aid activities, we will be subject to sanctions.\nA school participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or securing financial aid to any person involved in student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. If we pay a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of applicable DOE rules, we could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may affect negatively our ability to recruit and retain employees, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the GAO has issued a report critical of the DOE\u2019s enforcement of the incentive payment rule, and the DOE has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts. If the DOE determines that an institution violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to the DOE\u2019s satisfaction. The DOE may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs. The DOE may also seek to recover Title IV funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. In addition, third parties may file \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits on behalf of the DOE alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. Such suits may prompt the DOE investigations. Particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the incentive payment rule, the\nexistence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or the DOE investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline and could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, among other things. As a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf their student loan default rates are too high, our schools may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE regulations provide that an institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs ends when historical default rates reach a certain level in a single year or for a number of years. Because of our limited experience enrolling students who are participating in these programs, we have limited historical default rate information. Relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term, which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our default rate. If Aspen University or USU loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs because of high student loan default rates, our students would no longer be eligible to use Title IV Program funds in our institution, which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf either institutional accrediting agency loses recognition by the U.S. Secretary of Education or we fail to maintain institutional accreditation for Aspen University and USU, we may lose our ability to participate in Title IV Programs.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny of accrediting agencies and their accreditation of universities is likely to continue. For example, in February 2020 a bill titled the \u201cAccreditation Reform Act of 2020\u201d was introduced to Congress, which, if enacted, would implement a regulatory overhaul with respect to accrediting agencies by, among other things, requiring enhanced scrutiny of such agencies by the DOE. While Aspen University and USU are each accredited by a DOE-recognized accrediting body, if the DOE were to limit, suspend, or terminate either accreditor\u2019s recognition that institution could lose its ability to participate in the Title IV Programs. If we were unable to rely on accreditation in such circumstances, among other things, our students and our institution would be ineligible to participate in the Title IV Programs, and such consequence would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education in connection with the DOE\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies.\nFurthermore, based on continued scrutiny of the for-profit education sector, it is possible that accrediting bodies will respond by adopting additional criteria, standards and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like Aspen University and USU. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership/management of the institution, any significant changes in the institution\u2019s financial position, or any significant growth or decline in enrollment and/or programs, could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the applicable accreditor.\nIf we fail to comply with the DOE\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules, it could result in sanctions against our schools.\nThe DOE may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. In 2011, the DOE expanded the activities that constitute a substantial misrepresentation. Under the DOE regulations, an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to the Secretary of Education. The regulations define misrepresentation as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, and they define a misleading statement as any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse. The regulations define substantial misrepresentation as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to the person\u2019s detriment. If the DOE determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the DOE may revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs, deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution, or initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or termination the institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs. We expect that there could be an increase in our industry of administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation, which at a minimum would increase legal costs associated with defending such actions, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with the DOE\u2019s credit hour requirements, it could result in sanctions against our schools.\nThe DOE has defined \u201ccredit\u201d hour for Title IV purposes. The credit hour is used for Title IV purposes to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV aid that an institution may disburse for students in a particular program. The regulations define credit hour as an institutionally established equivalency\nthat reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and out of class and an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities. The final regulations also require institutional accreditors to review an institution\u2019s policies, procedures, and administration of policies and procedures for assignment of credit hours. An accreditor must take appropriate actions to address an institution\u2019s credit hour deficiencies and to notify the DOE if it finds systemic noncompliance or significant noncompliance in one or more programs. The DOE has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for Title IV purposes, it may require the institution to repay the amount of Title IV awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and, if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours, it may fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV Programs, the result of which could be that our business is materially and adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Congress continues to examine the for-profit postsecondary education sector which could result in legislation or additional the DOE rulemaking that may limit or condition Title IV Program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has increased its focus on for-profit education institutions, including with respect to their participation in the Title IV Programs, and has held hearings regarding such matters. In addition, the GAO released a series of reports following undercover investigations critical of for-profit institutions. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and reports will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV Programs, or more vigorous enforcement of Title IV requirements. Moreover, with the HEA pending reauthorization and an election coming up in 2020, political considerations could impact Title IV funding as well as the treatment of for-profit education in future legislation. To the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition Title IV Program participation of proprietary schools or the amount of federal student financial aid for which proprietary school students are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with the federal campus safety and security reporting requirements as implemented by the DOE would result in sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nWe must comply with certain campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1990 (the \u201cClery Act\u201d), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to the DOE and disclose in its annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred within the institution\u2019s so-called \u201cClery geography.\u201d As we expand to new campus locations, our efforts to comply with the Clery Act will become more costly and the risk of noncompliance will increase. Failure to comply with the Clery Act requirements or regulations promulgated by the DOE could result in fines or suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, or could harm our reputation, each of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although not related to educational regulations, we must comply with state and local social distancing and pandemic related regulations and orders. These requirements may increase our expenses.\nOther Risks\nDue to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nAny of the following factors could affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022Our failure to generate increasing material revenues;\n\u2022Our failure to become profitable or achieve positive adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization;\n\u2022Our failure to meet financial analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u2022Changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022A decline in our growth rate including new student enrollments and class starts;\n\u2022Our public disclosure of the terms of any financing which we consummate in the future;\n\u2022Disclosure of the results of our monthly payment plan and collections;\n\u2022The continued decline in the economy which impacts our ability to collect our accounts receivable;\n\u2022Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new services, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022The loss of Title IV funding or other regulatory actions;\n\u2022The sale of large numbers of shares of common stock by our officers, directors or other shareholders;\n\u2022Short selling activities; or\n\u2022Changes in market valuations of similar companies.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nBecause we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders and have other anti-takeover defenses, it may be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nOur Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support us and our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.", "PERMNO": 16856, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ASPU"}
