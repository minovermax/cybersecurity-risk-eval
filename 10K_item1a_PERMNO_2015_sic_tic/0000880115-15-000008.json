{"cik": "880115", "company": "CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY INC /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThere are many factors that affect our business, some of which are beyond our control. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The nature of our business activities further subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The risks described below are a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business. Other risks are described in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d and \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial individually or in the aggregate may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development projects as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our Common Stock could decline.\nOil and gas prices are volatile. Declines in commodity prices have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flows, access to the capital markets and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, operating results, liquidity, cash flows, profitability and value of proved reserves depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and gas. Commodity prices affect our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds under the credit facility and through the capital markets. The amount available for borrowing under the credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined at least semi-annually by our lenders taking into account the estimated value of our proved reserves and is subject to periodic redeterminations based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time. Declines in commodity prices have historically adversely affected the estimated value of our proved reserves and, in turn, the market values used by our lenders in determining our borrowing base. If commodity prices decline in the future, the decline could have adverse effects on our reserves and borrowing base.\nThe commodity prices we receive for our oil and gas depend upon factors beyond our control, including among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demands;\n\u2022\npipeline constraints and sufficient capacity;\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe foreign supply of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe price of oil and gas imports; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and foreign economic conditions.\nThese factors make it very difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. Substantially all of our oil and gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and are not long-term fixed price contracts. Further, oil prices and gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other.\nWe may not be able to replace production with new reserves.\nIn general, the volume of production from an oil and gas property declines as reserves related to that property are depleted. The decline rates depend upon reservoir characteristics. In past years, our oil and gas properties have had steep rates of decline and short estimated productive lives.\nExploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may not be able to economically find, develop or acquire additional reserves. Also, we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments if our cash flows\nfrom operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We cannot give assurance that our future exploration, development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.\nWe require substantial capital expenditures to conduct our operations and replace our production, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms necessary to fund our planned capital expenditures.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires us to spend substantial amounts of capital for exploration and development activities. Low product price environments such as the current downturn in oil prices that we are currently experiencing, as well as operating difficulties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our revenues and cash flows from operating activities to decrease and may limit our ability to internally fund our exploration and development activities. If our borrowing base under the credit facility is redetermined to a lower amount, this could adversely affect our ability to supplement cash flows from operations as a source of funding for these activities. After utilizing our available sources of financing, we may be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such capital expenditures. We cannot give assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or that cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures requirements.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. Our leverage and the covenants in our debt agreements could negatively impact our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the principal amount of our outstanding consolidated debt was approximately $704.7 million, which included $105 million outstanding under the credit facility and $599.7 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. The credit facility and the indenture governing the 2019 Senior Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) impose significant restrictions on our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, merge, make investments or loans, issue redeemable or preferred stock, pay distributions or dividends, create liens, guarantee other indebtedness and enter into new lines of business.\nOur level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could have important consequences on our business and operations. Among other things, these may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a significant portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on the debt, which will reduce the amount available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the credit ratings assigned by third-party rating agencies, which have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade their ratings of our debt and other obligations due to changes in our debt level or our financial condition;\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the capital markets;\n\u2022\nincrease our borrowing costs and impact the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in our debt agreements, including the addition of more restrictive covenants;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business as covenants and restrictions contained in our existing and possible future debt arrangements may require that we meet certain financial tests and place restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to similar companies in our industry that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nA higher level of debt will increase the risk that we may default on our financial obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance. Our future performance will be affected by oil and gas prices, financial, business, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, governmental and environmental regulations and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flows are not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance the debt, sell assets or sell shares of our stock on terms that we do not find attractive, if it can be done at all.\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, insurance companies and their affiliates. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty, principally with respect to hedging transactions but also insurance contracts and bank lending commitments. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\nOur hedging transactions could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flow.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into hedging transactions for a significant portion of our expected oil and gas production. These transactions could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. Conversely, if we do not enter into hedging transactions and product prices for our oil and gas production decline significantly during any unhedged production periods, we may realize a material reduction in our operating margins. The prolonged effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves. Currently, we are not a party to any hedging transactions.\nThe extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our derivative transactions. For example, the derivative instruments we utilize are primarily based on NYMEX futures prices, which may differ significantly from the actual crude oil and gas prices we realize in our operations. Furthermore, we have adopted a policy that requires, and the credit facility also mandates, that we enter into derivative transactions related to only a portion of our expected production volumes and, as a result, we will continue to have direct commodity price exposure on the portion of our production volumes not covered by these derivative transactions.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative transactions. If our actual future production is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If our actual future production is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flows from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution in our profitability and liquidity. As a result of these factors, our derivative activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nIn addition, our hedging transactions are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in receiving the full benefit of increases in oil and gas prices as a result of these transactions;\n\u2022\na counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument or may seek bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received; and\n\u2022\nthe steps we take to monitor our derivative instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.\nOur proved reserves are estimates and depend on many assumptions. Any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could cause the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves, and our revenues, profitability and cash flows to be materially different from our estimates.\nThe accuracy of estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows from such reserves is a function of the quality of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data and is subject to various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses and other matters. Although we believe that our estimated proved reserves represent reserves that we are reasonably certain to recover, actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from the assumptions and estimates used to determine proved reserves. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which in turn could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and the availability of capital resources. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors, many of which\nare beyond our control. Downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves could require us to impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe present value of proved reserves will not necessarily equal the current fair market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with reserve reporting requirements of the SEC, we are required to establish economic production for reserves on an average historical price. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those required by the SEC. The timing of both the production and expenses with respect to the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value.\nThe estimated proved reserve information is based upon reserve reports prepared by independent engineers. From time to time, estimates of our reserves are also made by the lenders under the credit facility in establishing the borrowing base under the credit facility and by our engineers for use in developing business plans and making various decisions. Such estimates may vary significantly from those of the independent engineers and have a material effect upon our business decisions and available capital resources.\nOur producing properties are largely concentrated in two major geographic areas, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and the Giddings Area in East Central Texas. Concentrations of reserves in limited geographic areas may disproportionately expose us to operational, regulatory and geological risks.\nOur core producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and the Giddings Area in East Central Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, gas or NGL.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, a significant portion of our proved reserves was derived from the Wolfcamp formation in the Delaware Basin and the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations in the Giddings Area. This concentration of assets within a few producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nOur proved undeveloped locations are scheduled to be drilled over several years, subjecting us to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of our drilling activities.\nWe have assigned proved undeveloped reserves to certain of our drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. These identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. At December 31, 2014, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 44% of total estimated proved reserves. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including (1) our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; (2) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel; (3) seasonal conditions; (4) regulatory and third-party approvals; (5) oil and gas prices; and (6) drilling and recompletion costs and results. Because of these uncertainties, we may defer drilling on, or never drill, some or all of these potential locations. If we defer drilling more than five years from the date proved undeveloped reserves were first assigned to a drilling location, we may be required under SEC guidelines to downgrade the category of the applicable reserves from proved undeveloped to probable. Any reclassification of reserves from proved undeveloped to probable could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our debt and equity securities. In 2014, we reclassified 4,911 MBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to probable as a result of this 5-year development rule.\nPrice declines may result in impairments of our asset carrying values.\nCommodity prices have a significant impact on the present value of our proved reserves. Accounting rules require us to impair, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in certain situations. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets, the carrying value may not be recoverable, and an impairment may be required. Any impairment charges we record in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred.\nOur exploration activities subject us to greater risks than development activities.\nGenerally, our oil and gas exploration activities pose a higher economic risk to us than our development activities. Exploration activities involve the drilling of wells in areas where there is little or no known production. Development activities relate to\nincreasing oil or gas production from an area that is known to be productive by drilling additional wells, working over and recompleting existing wells and other production enhancement techniques. Exploration projects are identified through subjective analysis of geological and geophysical data, including the use of 3-D seismic and other available technology. By comparison, the identification of development prospects is significantly based upon existing production surrounding or adjacent to the proposed drilling site.\nTo the extent we engage in exploration activities, we have a greater risk of drilling dry holes or not finding oil and gas that can be produced economically. The seismic data and other technology we use does not allow us to know with certainty prior to drilling a well whether oil or gas is present or can be produced economically. We cannot assure you that any of our future exploration efforts will be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, it will have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and capital resources.\nDrilling oil and gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control.\nDrilling oil and gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter economically productive oil or gas reservoirs. We may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment. In addition, we are often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, which may increase our costs or restrict our activities; and\n\u2022\ncosts of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and equipment and services.\nIf we do not encounter reserves that can be produced economically or if our drilling operations are curtailed, delayed or cancelled, it could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAcquisitions are subject to the risks and uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities and may be disruptive and difficult to integrate into our business.\nOur ongoing business strategy includes growing our reserves and drilling inventory through acquisitions. Acquired properties can be subject to significant unknown liabilities. Prior to completing an acquisition, it is generally not feasible to conduct a detailed review of each individual property to be acquired. Even a detailed review or inspection of each property may not reveal all existing or potential liabilities associated with owning or operating the property. Moreover, some potential liabilities, such as environmental liabilities related to groundwater contamination, may not be discovered even when a review or inspection is performed.\nOur initial reserve estimates for acquired properties may be inaccurate. Downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, including reserves added through acquisitions, could require us to write-down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur failure to integrate acquired properties successfully into our existing business could result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. In addition, we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions. The scope and cost of these obligations may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition.\nThe process of integrating acquired properties into our existing business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating hazards to which our business is exposed.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and gas, such as windstorms, lightning strikes, blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids (including fluids used in hydraulic fracturing activities), fires, severe weather and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations, all of which could result in a substantial loss. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. Such insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot give assurance of the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nOur business depends on oil and gas transportation facilities, most of which are owned by others.\nThe marketability of our oil and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, maintenance and repair and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and gas.\nFuture shortages of available drilling rigs, equipment and personnel may delay or restrict our operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of drilling rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise with increases in the number of active rigs in service. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel may increase drilling costs or delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and gas, the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather-related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to shut-in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil, gas or NGL pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenues from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay dividends on our Common Stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock, and the Board does not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. Covenants contained in the credit facility and the Indenture restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nCompetition in all areas of our operations is intense. We experience competition from major and independent oil and gas companies and oil and gas syndicates in bidding for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as in acquiring the equipment, data and labor required to operate and develop such properties. A number of our competitors have financial resources and acquisition, exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. Competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend on our success at selecting and acquiring suitable producing properties and prospects for future development and exploration activities.\nIn addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenues. The market for our oil, gas and NGL production depends on factors beyond our control, including domestic and foreign political conditions, the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGL, the price of imports of oil and gas, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur success is highly dependent on our senior management. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel is intense. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nWe are primarily controlled by Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and his children\u2019s limited partnership.\nClayton W. Williams, Jr., age 83, beneficially owns, either individually or through his affiliates, approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Mr. Williams is also our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Williams has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of the Board members, and in all other facets of our business, including both our business strategy and daily operations.\nWCPL, a limited partnership in which Mr. Williams\u2019 adult children are the limited partners, owns an additional 25% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Mel G. Riggs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, is the sole general partner of WCPL and has the power to vote or direct the voting of the shares held by WCPL. In voting these shares, Mr. Riggs will not be acting in his capacity as an officer and director of the Company and will consider the interests of WCPL and Mr. Williams\u2019 children. They may have interests that differ from the interests of our other shareholders.\nThe retirement, incapacity or death of Mr. Williams, or any change in the power to vote shares beneficially owned by Mr. Williams or held by WCPL, could result in negative market or industry perception and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBy extending credit to our customers, we are exposed to potential economic loss.\nWe sell our oil and gas production to various customers, serve as operator in the drilling, completion and operation of oil and gas wells and enter into derivatives with various counterparties. As appropriate, we obtain letters of credit to secure amounts due from our principal oil and gas purchasers and follow other procedures to monitor credit risk from joint owners and derivatives counterparties. We cannot give assurance that we will not suffer any economic loss related to credit risks in the future.\nCompliance with laws and regulations governing our activities could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nOur oil and gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.\nAll of the states in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of certain states also limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from our properties.\nThe FERC regulates interstate gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, the FERC has issued various orders that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas. These orders resulted in a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales services such pipelines previously performed. These FERC actions were designed to increase competition within all phases of the gas industry. The interstate regulatory framework may enhance our ability to market and transport our gas, although it may also subject us to greater competition and to the more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such tolerances.\nOur sales of oil and NGL are not presently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. The FERC has implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would index such rate to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs, which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and NGL.\nUnder the EP Act 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our gas operations have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional entities to FERC annual reporting. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by the FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production and related activities are subject to extensive environmental regulations and to laws that can give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the emission and discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities to investigate or remediate contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operational control, properties we formerly owned or operated and sites where our wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as at properties that we currently own or operate. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from any noncompliance with applicable environmental laws regardless of fault. Under a number of environmental laws, such liabilities may also be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Environmental requirements generally have become more stringent in recent years, and compliance with those requirements more expensive.\nWe have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with extensive applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and remediation costs, as well as the issuance of administrative or judicial orders limiting operations or prohibiting certain activities. Some of our properties, including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operating control, may be affected by environmental contamination that may require investigation or remediation. Some of our operations are located in environmentally sensitive environments, such as coastal waters, wetlands and other protected areas. Some of our operations are in areas particularly susceptible to damage by hurricanes or other destructive storms, which could result in damage to facilities and discharge of pollutants. In addition, claims are sometimes made or threatened against companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production by owners of surface estates, adjoining properties or others alleging damage resulting from environmental contamination and other incidents of operation, and such claims have been asserted against us as well as companies we have acquired. Compliance with, and liabilities for remediation under, these laws and regulations, and liabilities concerning contamination or hazardous materials, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our Common Stock.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and gas that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, including emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources. The EPA\u2019s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse gases from large stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA from implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to implement, the rules. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and gas production facilities, on an annual basis.\nIn addition, from time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emission of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emission control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits. The position limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September of 2012 although the CFTC has stated that it will appeal the District Court\u2019s decision. The CFTC also has finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definitions of \u201cswap,\u201d \u201csecurity-based swap,\u201d \u201cswap dealer\u201d and \u201cmajor swap participant.\u201d The Act and CFTC rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements). In addition new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time. Other regulations also remain to\nbe finalized, and the CFTC recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects.\nThe Act also may require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral that could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into dense subsurface rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel, and in February 2014, issued permitting guidance for such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act that would require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nThe White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on water resources. The EPA has indicated that it expects to issue its study report in the first half of 2015. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards sometime in 2015. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their findings, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from various sources for use in our operations. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflict could adversely affect our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.\nA terrorist attack, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a decrease in our revenues. Oil and gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production, transportation, processing or marketing of oil and gas production are destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.", "PERMNO": 79159, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CWEI"}
