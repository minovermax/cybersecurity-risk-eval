{"cik": "1567514", "company": "Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere throughout this report.\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. If any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend heavily on the success of our product candidate lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, which has not yet been approved by the FDA. If we experience material delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain marketing approval for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, which has not yet been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion in deciding whether or not lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia should be granted approval based our clinical trials and nonclinical studies to date. We completed this NDA submission in the third quarter of 2018 and the FDA accepted for review the NDA in the fourth quarter of 2018. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of September 27, 2019. There is no assurance, however, that the FDA will complete its review within this timeframe and does not ensure that our NDA for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia will be approved.\nObtaining approval to market lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in a timely manner will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwhether or not the FDA determines that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials and nonclinical studies of lumateperone demonstrates that lumateperone is safe and effective as a treatment for schizophrenia;\n\u2022\nwhether or not the FDA is satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for lumateperone are adequate, that the labeling is satisfactory and that plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation are sufficient; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and nature of the FDA\u2019s comments and questions regarding the NDA for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, the scheduling and recommendations of any advisory committee meeting to consider lumateperone, the time required to respond to the FDA\u2019s comments and questions and to obtain the final labeling for lumateperone and any other delays that may be associated with the NDA review process.\nIf we experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States, we will not receive product revenues during the delay. Any such delay may materially harm our product revenues and cash flows. If we do not obtain approval to market lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States, our business will be materially harmed.\nIn order to execute our business plan and achieve profitability, we need to effectively commercialize lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia.\nWe cannot be sure that lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market even if we gain marketing approval for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in a timely manner. We expect that the initial commercial success of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, if approved, will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy, cost, approved use, and side-effect profile of lumateperone regimens relative to competitive treatment regimens for the treatment of schizophrenia;\n\u2022\nthe timing of potential marketing approval from the FDA for the treatment of lumateperone;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our commercial strategy for the launch and marketing of lumateperone, including our pricing strategy and the effectiveness of our efforts to obtain adequate third-party reimbursements;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and successfully monitoring commercial manufacturing arrangements for lumateperone with third-party manufacturers to ensure they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities, including the FDA, which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of lumateperone;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of lumateperone by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of recent or potential health care legislation in the United States.\nWhile we believe that lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia will have a commercially competitive profile, we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue that will be generated if lumateperone receives regulatory approval. If we do not effectively commercialize lumateperone, we will not be able to execute our business plan and may not be able to achieve profitability. If our revenues, market share and/or other indicators of market acceptance of lumateperone do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nEven if we gain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, if the sales and marketing capabilities we are establishing or our third-party relationships for the commercialization of our drug candidates are not effective, our drug candidates may not be successfully commercialized.\nWe have no experience as a company in marketing drugs or with respect to pricing and obtaining adequate third-party reimbursement for drugs. We are in the process of building our commercial organization and capabilities in the United States in order to prepare to market lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia. We will need to successfully complete the expansion of our capabilities and/or enter into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our other product candidates, including lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, if they are approved for sale. If our sales and marketing capabilities or our third-party relationships for the commercialization of our drug candidates are not effective, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe have never generated revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so until at least the fourth quarter of 2019, if ever.\nOur ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of and obtain regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize lumateperone and our other product candidates. We have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our business and prospects. To date, we have not generated any product revenues from our product candidates currently in development. We cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates currently in development will ever become marketable products.\nWe must demonstrate that our product candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy for their intended uses before the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the European Union and elsewhere will approve them for commercialization. Significant additional research, preclinical testing and clinical testing is required before we can file applications with the FDA or other regulatory authorities for premarket approval of our drug candidates. In addition, to compete effectively, our drugs must be easy to administer, cost-effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale. We may not achieve any of these objectives.\nOur lead product candidate, lumateperone, is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar depression and agitation associated with dementia, including AD. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the rolling submission of our NDA with the FDA for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia. The FDA accepted for review the NDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of September 27, 2019. There can be no assurance that any NDA that we submit to the FDA will approved by the FDA or that, if approved, we will be able to successfully commercialize lumateperone for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In addition, in response to questions raised by the FDA relating to certain findings observed in nonclinical toxicology studies of lumateperone in an animal species, based on feedback from the FDA, we incorporated additional monitoring in our long-term safety study for metabolites seen in animal species but not seen to date in humans, and continued to monitor for toxicities in our nonclinical studies. If the FDA determines the results of our long-term safety study and nonclinical studies do not sufficiently demonstrate the safety and tolerability of long-term use of lumateperone, the FDA may not approve an NDA for lumateperone for a chronic condition such as schizophrenia.\nOur bipolar depression program consists of three Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. In the ITI-007-401 and the ITI-007-404 trials, lumateperone is being evaluated as a monotherapy and in the ITI-007-402 trial, lumateperone is being evaluated as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. All three trials are evaluating lumateperone in patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing a current major depressive episode. We have also initiated Phase 3 development of lumateperone for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, including AD. Our ITI-007-201 trial is a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and clinically significant symptoms of agitation. In the fourth quarter of 2018, an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, completed a pre-specified interim analysis of the ITI-007-201 trial, concluded that the trial is not likely to meet its primary endpoint upon completion and therefore recommended the study should be stopped for futility. As a result, we determined to discontinue the ITI-007-201 trial. Lumateperone was generally well tolerated in the ITI-007-201 trial and the decision to discontinue the study was not related to safety. We are analyzing the data set from this trial and will determine the next steps in our dementia program following completion of this analysis.\nIn addition, we intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, including cardiovascular disease. Following the positive safety and tolerability results in our Phase 1 program, we have initiated our development program for ITI-214 for Parkinson\u2019s disease. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ITI-214 has been completed and topline results demonstrated ITI-214 was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile and clinical signs consistent with improvements in motor symptoms and dyskinesias. In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, the investigational new drug application, or IND, went into effect for ITI-214 for the treatment of heart failure. We have initiated clinical conduct of the first clinical study in this program, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of escalating single doses of ITI-214 to evaluate safety and hemodynamic effects in patients with systolic heart failure.\nWe cannot be certain that the clinical development of these or any other drug candidates in preclinical testing or clinical development will be successful, that we will receive the regulatory approvals required to commercialize them or that any of our other research and drug discovery programs will yield a drug candidate\nsuitable for investigation through clinical trials. Our commercial revenues from our product candidates currently in development, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that will not become marketable until at least the fourth quarter of 2019, if at all.\nThere is no guarantee that our planned clinical trials for lumateperone will be successful.\nThe historical rate of failures for product candidates in clinical development and late-stage clinical trials is high. We may be required to conduct further clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia, and we plan to conduct further clinical trials in other indications beyond schizophrenia, there is no guarantee that we will have the same level of success in these trials as we have had in certain of our earlier clinical trials, or be successful at all.\nIn addition, although we believe that lumateperone and follow-on compounds may also have clinical utility in indications other than schizophrenia, such as behavioral disturbances in dementia, bipolar disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, non-motor disorders associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, we have never tested lumateperone in Phase 2 clinical trials in the patient population for these other indications, except for ITI-007-200, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of lumateperone in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including AD, for which we announced top-line data in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nIf we do not successfully complete clinical development of lumateperone, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from it and to generate product revenues. Even though we have successfully completed certain clinical trials for lumateperone in patients with schizophrenia, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of future trials that may be needed before we may submit an NDA to the FDA for the initial or other future indications. Of the vast number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA, and even less result in the NDA ultimately being approved by the FDA for commercialization.\nThe FDA may ultimately determine that our Phase 3 clinical trials and non-clinical studies are not sufficient for regulatory approval. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials and non-clinical studies, our development of lumateperone for schizophrenia will be more time-consuming and costly than we presently anticipate, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe FDA may not agree with our belief that the lumateperone late-stage clinical development program, including two large, well-controlled positive studies (a Phase 2 and a Phase 3) and supportive evidence from a second Phase 3 study, collectively provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, the FDA may not agree with one or more aspects of our clinical trial designs, including the duration of the trials, clinical endpoints, controls, dose ranges, collection of safety data, or adequacy of our non-clinical studies. If the FDA does not agree with our clinical and non-clinical designs, or our interpretations of the data from such studies, our development of lumateperone in schizophrenia and other indications may be delayed, and we may incur additional costs and devote additional resources to address any concerns the FDA may have. In addition, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or studies, which could result in additional delays and costs.\nEven if we eventually receive approval of lumateperone, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials. The FDA may also approve lumateperone for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of lumateperone or our other product candidates. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval for lumateperone would delay or prevent commercialization of lumateperone and would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf the results of our long-term safety study do not adequately demonstrate the safety and tolerability of long-term use of lumateperone, the FDA may not approve our NDA for lumateperone for a chronic condition such as schizophrenia.\nThe FDA had raised questions relating to certain findings observed in nonclinical toxicology studies of lumateperone in an animal species and requested additional information to confirm that the nonclinical findings are not indicative of a safety risk associated with long term exposure in humans. The data we presented supports the position that there are significant species differences in the metabolism of lumateperone. Based on the FDA\u2019s agreement that we presented adequate data indicating that the toxicity seen in the animal species is not relevant to humans, we proceeded with our long-term safety study of lumateperone in patients with schizophrenia. In December 2018, we released results from the second part of our open-label safety switching study assessing the effects of long-term administration of lumateperone in patients with stable symptoms of schizophrenia. The data demonstrated that lumateperone, administered for up to one year, was generally well tolerated and exhibited statistically significant improvements from baseline on key safety measures of body weight, cardiometabolic and endocrine parameters, without motor side effects often associated with other antipsychotic medications. The study has been extended to allow patients to stay on lumateperone for more than one year and study conduct is ongoing. If the FDA determines the results of our long-term safety study do not adequately demonstrate the safety and tolerability of long-term use of lumateperone, our NDA for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia may not be approved and we may not be able to file an NDA for lumateperone for another chronic condition. The failure to receive FDA approval of our NDA for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia would have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect our net losses to continue for at least several years and are unable to predict the extent of future losses or when we will become profitable, if ever.\nWe have experienced significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $562.4 million. We expect to incur net losses over the next several years as we advance our programs and incur significant clinical development costs. We have not received, and do not expect to receive until at least the fourth quarter of 2019, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates. Substantially all of our revenues to date were from our license and collaboration agreement with Takeda and our agreements with various U.S. governmental agencies and other parties, including our research and development grants. In October 2014, we entered into the Takeda Termination Agreement, which terminated our license and collaboration agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which all rights with respect to ITI-214 that we previously granted to Takeda were returned to us. We will not, therefore, receive any further milestone payments from Takeda and we cannot be certain that we will enter into additional collaboration agreements. To obtain revenues from our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, and manufacturing and marketing drugs with significant market potential. We may never succeed in these activities, and may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations.\nWe have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception. Our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities totaled $347.5 million at December 31, 2018. While we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, together with interest on cash balances, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020, the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the ongoing status of our NDA submission for lumateperone in patients with schizophrenia; the ongoing status of our Phase 3 clinical trials of lumateperone in patients with bipolar depression; the continued development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions; and our other planned clinical and non-clinical trials. We anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for further development of lumateperone in patients with dementia, including AD and in other programs including in patients with depressive disorders and other\nindications, and for development of our other product candidates. If the FDA requires that we perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, or we experience delays or other setbacks in our clinical trials, our expenses would further increase beyond what we currently expect and the anticipated timing of any potential future NDA submission would likely be delayed.\nWith the remaining proceeds from our public offerings in September 2015 and October 2017, we intend to fund the following: pre-launch activities for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia and, if it receives regulatory approval, to fund our initial commercialization efforts; the completion of our clinical trials of lumateperone in bipolar disorder as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate; clinical trials of lumateperone for the treatment of depressive disorders; clinical trials of lumateperone for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia, including AD; preclinical and clinical development of our ITI-007 long acting injectable development program; other clinical trials of lumateperone; the continued clinical development of our PDE1 program, including ITI-214; and research and preclinical development of our other product candidates and the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of lumateperone. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be used to fund new and ongoing research and development activities, new business opportunities, general corporate purposes, including general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and working capital. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital beyond the net proceeds from these offerings to continue our clinical development and commercialization activities. Because successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:\n\u2022\nwhether the FDA ultimately determines that our Phase 3 clinical trials and non-clinical studies of lumateperone are or are not sufficient for regulatory approval of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia;\n\u2022\nthe progress in, and the costs of, our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development programs;\n\u2022\nthe scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nthe ability of any future collaborators and us to reach the milestones, and other events or developments, triggering payments under any future collaboration agreements or to otherwise make payments under such agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into new, and to maintain any existing, collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which any future collaborators are obligated to reimburse us for clinical trial costs under any future collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing applications for regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing for and establishing, or contracting for, sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in expanding the accounting and data management systems to support commercial operations, including but not limited to an Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP); and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with litigation.\nUntil we can generate significant continuing revenues, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, strategic collaborations, private or public sales of our securities, debt financings, grant funding, or by licensing all or a portion of our product candidates or technology. Turmoil and volatility in the financial markets have adversely affected the market capitalizations of many biotechnology companies, and generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. This, coupled with other factors, may limit our access to additional financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access sufficient funding. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do obtain additional funding through equity offerings, the ownership of our existing stockholders and purchasers of shares of our common stock in any such offering will be diluted, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. If funds are not available, we will be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of our cash and we may not use our cash effectively, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur management has significant flexibility in applying our cash resources, including the net proceeds from our public offerings completed in September 2015 and October 2017, and could use these resources for corporate purposes that do not increase our market value, or in ways with which our stockholders may not agree. We may use our cash resources for corporate purposes that do not yield a significant return or any return at all for our stockholders, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials for lumateperone or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from the FDA for the sale of lumateperone, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for its proposed indications. Clinical trials are time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to delays. It may take several years to complete the preclinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.\nIn connection with clinical trials, we face risks that a product candidate may not prove to be efficacious; patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested; the results may not confirm the positive results of our earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials; and the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. If we do not successfully complete preclinical and clinical development, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from our product candidates and to generate product revenues. Even if we do successfully complete clinical trials, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of additional trials that may be needed before an NDA may be submitted to the FDA or the FDA may approve the NDA.\nAdditionally, the FDA may not agree with our belief that the lumateperone late-stage clinical development program collectively provides evidence of the efficacy and safety of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia, which may require us to conduct additional trials, which would be expensive and time-consuming, would delay our ability to file an NDA with the FDA, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDelays, suspensions and terminations in our clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay our ability to generate product revenues and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future growth prospects.\nThe commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in: demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and clinical trial sites; manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate; obtaining clearance from the FDA to commence clinical trials pursuant to an IND; obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical trial site; and patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to a number of factors, including: ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or requests by them for supplemental information with respect to our clinical trial results; failure to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements; lower than anticipated screening or retention rates of patients in clinical trials; serious adverse events or side effects experienced by participants; and insufficient supply or deficient quality of product candidates or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials. In the fourth quarter of 2018, a DMC completed a pre-specified interim analysis of our ITI-007-201 Phase 3 trial in patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and clinically significant symptoms of agitation, concluded that the trial is not likely to meet its primary endpoint upon completion and therefore recommended the study should be stopped for futility. As a result, we determined to discontinue the ITI-007-201 trial.\nMany of these factors may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a current or potential product candidate. If we experience delays, suspensions or terminations in a clinical trial, our costs will increase, the commercial prospects for the related product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.\nSafety issues with our product candidates, or with product candidates or approved products of third parties that are similar to our product candidates, could give rise to delays in the regulatory approval process, restrictions on labeling or product withdrawal after approval.\nProblems with product candidates or approved products marketed by third parties that utilize the same therapeutic target or that belong to the same therapeutic class as our product candidates could adversely affect the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. In 2012, the FDA released draft guidance recommending that prospective suicidality assessments be performed in clinical trials of any drug being developed for a psychiatric indication. Our development programs are focused on psychiatric indications. Our PDE program is a novel target and may have unexpected safety effects that do not appear until late in clinical development or after commercial approval. As we continue the development and clinical trials of our product candidates, there can be no assurance that our product candidates will not experience significant safety issues.\nDiscovery of previously unknown class effect problems may prevent or delay clinical development and commercial approval of product candidates or result in restrictions on permissible uses after their approval, including withdrawal of the medicine from the market. Many drugs acting on the CNS include boxed warnings and precautions related to suicidal behavior or ideation, driving impairment, somnolence/sedation and dizziness, discontinuation, weight gain, non-insulin dependent (type II) diabetes, cardiovascular side effects, sleep disturbances, and motor disturbances. If we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the mechanisms of action or classes of our product candidates or specific product candidates:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program prior to or following approval;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates or, as a condition of approval, may require specific warnings and contraindications;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and require us to take our drug off the market;\n\u2022\nwe may have limitations on how we promote our drugs;\n\u2022\nsales of products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which, in turn, could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nFinally, if the FDA determines that a drug may present a risk of substance abuse, it can recommend to the Drug Enforcement Administration that the drug be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act. Any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates would delay commercialization of our product candidates, and severely harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we seek to enter into strategic alliances for our drug candidates, but fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances, we may have to reduce or delay our drug candidate development or increase our expenditures.\nAn important element of a biotechnology company\u2019s strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing its drug candidates may be to enter into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance its programs and enable it to maintain its financial and operational capacity. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. If we seek such alliances, we may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, these alliances may be unsuccessful. On October 31, 2014, we entered into the Termination Agreement with Takeda, which terminated the Takeda License Agreement, pursuant to which all rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to us. If we seek such alliances and then fail to create and maintain suitable alliances, we may have to limit the size or scope of, or delay, one or more of our drug development or research programs. If we elect to fund drug development or research programs on our own, we will have to increase our expenditures and will need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nTo the extent we are able to enter into collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances, we will be exposed to risks related to those collaborations and alliances.\nBiotechnology companies at our stage of development sometimes become dependent upon collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances to complete the development and commercialization of drug candidates, particularly after the Phase 2 stage of clinical testing. If we elect to enter into collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances, these arrangements may place the development of our drug candidates outside our control, may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us.\nDependence on collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances would subject us to a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may devote to the drug candidates;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights, such as marketing and distribution rights;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\na collaborator could independently move forward with a competing drug candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and\n\u2022\ncollaborative arrangements are often terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our drug candidates.\nPreliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we may announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available.\nFrom time to time, we may announce or publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies. Preliminary and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily predictive of final results. Preliminary and interim data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes in the final data compared to the interim data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nAlthough we design and manage our current preclinical studies and clinical trials, we do not now have the ability to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates on our own. In addition to our collaborators, we rely on contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, and contract laboratories to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials. In addition, we also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical studies, including studies regarding biological activity, safety, absorption, metabolism, and excretion of product candidates.\nOur preclinical activities or clinical trials may be delayed, suspended, or terminated if: the quality or accuracy of the data obtained by the third parties on whom we rely is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or if for other reasons, these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet regulatory obligations or expected deadlines, or these third parties need to be replaced.\nIf the third parties on whom we rely fail to perform, our development costs may increase, our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and consequently, to commercialize our product candidates may be delayed or prevented altogether. We currently use several contract research organizations to perform services for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or incurring additional expenses.\nEven if we successfully complete the clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates, the product candidates may fail for other reasons.\nEven if we successfully complete the clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates, the product candidates may fail for other reasons, including the possibility that the product candidates will:\n\u2022\nfail to receive the regulatory approvals required to market them as drugs;\n\u2022\nbe subject to proprietary rights held by others requiring the negotiation of a license agreement prior to marketing;\n\u2022\nbe difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;\n\u2022\nhave adverse side effects that make their use less desirable; or\n\u2022\nfail to compete with product candidates or other treatments commercialized by our competitors.\nIf we are unable to receive the required regulatory approvals, secure our intellectual property rights, minimize the incidence of any adverse side effects or fail to compete with our competitors\u2019 products, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential products.\nWith regard to our drug candidates, if any, approved by the FDA or by another regulatory authority, we are held to extensive regulatory requirements over product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the drug candidates. Potentially costly follow-up or post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Previously unknown problems with the drug candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drug, and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market.\nIn addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change. New statutory requirements or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business could suffer.\nOur product candidates may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients, or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues, which will undermine our future growth prospects.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, health care professionals and third-party payors, and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\npricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is at least as beneficial as the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide some additional patient benefit over the current standard of care, that product will not achieve market acceptance and we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nThe failure to attract and retain skilled personnel and key relationships could impair our drug development and commercialization efforts.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and key clinical development, scientific and technical personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, clinical development, scientific or technical staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of drug development and other business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our strategy. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us. We intend to expand and develop new drug candidates, and will need additional funding to grow our business. We will need to hire additional employees in order to continue our research and clinical trials and to market our drugs when approved. This strategy will require us to recruit additional executive management and clinical development, regulatory, scientific, technical and sales and marketing personnel. There is currently intense competition for skilled executives and employees with relevant clinical development, scientific, technical and sales and marketing expertise, and this competition is likely to continue. The inability to attract and retain sufficient clinical development, scientific, technical and managerial personnel, due to intense competition and our limited resources, would limit or delay our product development efforts, which would adversely affect the development of our drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs and growth of our business.\nWe may not be able to continue or fully exploit our partnerships with outside scientific and clinical advisors, which could impair the progress of our clinical trials and our research and development efforts.\nWe work with scientific and clinical advisors at academic and other institutions who are experts in the field of CNS disorders. They advise us with respect to our clinical trials. These advisors are not our employees and may have other commitments that would limit their future availability to us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services, which may impair our reputation in the industry and delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates have never been manufactured on a commercial scale, and there are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial scale. In particular, we will need to develop a larger scale manufacturing process that is more efficient and cost-effective to commercialize lumateperone and other product candidates, which may not be successful.\nOur product candidates have never been manufactured on a commercial scale, and there are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. On January 4, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Siegfried. Under the Siegfried Agreement, Siegfried has agreed to manufacture and supply the API for lumateperone in commercial quantities. There is no assurance that Siegfried or other manufacturers will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process for lumateperone which achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost of goods. Even if we could otherwise obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate, there is no assurance that our manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of the approved product for commercialization, our commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture and supply our product candidates for us. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers. We may also face significant delays in our clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product introductions and commercialization.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities and have limited experience in the manufacturing of drugs or in designing drug-manufacturing processes. We have contracted with third-party manufacturers to produce, in collaboration with us, our product candidates, including lumateperone, for clinical trials. For example, on January 4, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Siegfried under which Siegfried has agreed to manufacture and supply the API for lumateperone in commercial quantities. Each month, we will provide Siegfried with a rolling forecast of our anticipated requirements for supply of the API, with the first 12 months of each forecast being binding on us. Under the Siegfried Agreement, we have the right to and may purchase the API for lumateperone from other suppliers, including if Siegfried cannot fulfill our requirements. In addition, we expect to have an additional third party source of supply of the API for lumateperone in commercial quantities. While we believe that there are alternative sources available to manufacture our product candidates, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or additional expenditures. We cannot estimate these delays or costs with certainty but, if they were to occur, they could cause a delay in our development and commercialization efforts. If our existing or planned third party manufacturing arrangements are terminated or if the sources of supply from such arrangements are inadequate and we must seek supply agreements from alternative sources, we may be unable to enter into such agreements or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could delay a product launch or subject our commercialization efforts to significant supply risk.\nManufacturers of our product candidates are obliged to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with the cGMPs requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide product candidates in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or terminate the clinical trials completely.\nIn addition, the facilities used by our contract manufacturers or other third party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that are being conducted following our request for regulatory approval for lumateperone from the FDA. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure of any of our current or future contract manufacturers to establish and follow cGMPs and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approval of product candidates or the ultimate launch of products based on our product candidates into the market. Failure by our current or future third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs,\ndelays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nWe will need to continue to manage our organization and we may encounter difficulties with our staffing and any future transitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe will need to manage our operations and facilities effectively in order to advance our drug development programs (including lumateperone and ITI-214), facilitate any future collaborations, and pursue other development activities. It is possible that our infrastructure may be inadequate to support our future efforts and growth. In particular, we may have to develop information technology systems and internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities if we decide to market any drug that we may successfully develop. We may not successfully manage our operations and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our products do not receive coverage from payors or sell for inadequate prices, or if patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nPatients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Even if we obtain coverage for any approved products, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use any products we may market unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of those products.\nIn addition, the market for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate payment levels for, our products from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize any approved products and thereby adversely impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.\nIn the future, if we have products that are approved, health care legislation may make it more difficult to receive revenues from those products.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals in recent years to change the health care system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, ACA, became law in the United States. The ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the health care industry. Among the provisions of ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nimposition of an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\nexpansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers agreed to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nrequirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including reporting any \u201cpayments or transfers of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals and other health care providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022\na requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\na Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nSome of the details regarding the implementation of the ACA are yet to be determined and, at this time, it remains unclear what the full effect that the ACA will have on our business. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For instance, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the ACA required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price for Medicare Part D beneficiaries during their coverage gap period beginning in 2019. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved.\nIn addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a\ndrug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with any products we may market, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe expect that the ACA, in its current form or as it may be amended, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other health care reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any products we may develop, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nIn order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial, and related capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these critical commercial services. While we have begun the process of building an organization for the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales, marketing, managerial and related capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nWe also may not be successful entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively, which could damage our reputation. If we do not establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.\nThere are possible limitations on our use of net operating losses.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $145 million, which are available to reduce any future federal and state taxable income and will begin to expire in the year 2034. The use of our NOLs may be restricted due to changes in our ownership, including as a result of our public offerings.\nUnder Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we performed a Section 382 ownership analysis and determined that no ownership change occurred (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) as a result of our\npublic offering in 2017. Our previous ownership analysis, through December 31, 2015, reflected an ownership change occurred as a result of our 2015 public offerings. Based on the analysis performed, however, we do not believe that the Section 382 annual limitation will impact our ability to utilize the tax attributes that existed as of the date of the ownership change in a material manner. If we experience an ownership change in the future, the tax benefits related to the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited or lost.\nIn September 2016, we licensed certain intellectual property rights to our wholly-owned subsidiary, ITI Limited, which was formed in the third quarter of 2016. The costs to develop, test, manufacture and perform other activities related to the ITI-007 program will be the responsibility of ITI Limited and will be incurred outside of the United States. Therefore, the majority of expected losses that we incur during the next several years will not result in additional NOLs in the U.S. to be carried forward and used against future net income of the U.S. operations.\nThe comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d or TCJA, that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating loss carryforwards, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. In addition, the TCJA repealed the alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and provides for a refund of taxes paid between 2018 and 2021. With the passing of the TCJA, the Company will receive a refund in future periods for AMT paid in prior years. The Company has recognized a benefit of approximately $1.1 million for these taxes on its December 31, 2017 consolidated statement of operations. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business and depending on possible foreign operations, among other things, the impact of this tax reform is uncertain and could be adverse. This report does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect holders of our common stock. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we, our clinical research organizations and other third parties on which we rely collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information, including research and development information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches, interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates, or damage from natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any such event could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPPA, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research and\ndevelopment activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may be undermined if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to our product candidates and technologies and their uses, as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. We have patent rights under issued patents in many cases covering our lumateperone and ITI-002 development programs. Nonetheless, the issued patents and patent applications covering our primary technology programs remain subject to uncertainty and continuous monitoring and action by us due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for our product candidates or the technologies we rely upon;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nour disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u2022\nany or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not seek or obtain patent protection in all countries that will eventually provide a significant business opportunity;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nour proprietary technologies may not be patentable;\n\u2022\nothers may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u2022\nothers may identify prior art which could invalidate our patents; and\n\u2022\nchanges to patent laws may limit the exclusivity rights of patent holders.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our product candidates or technologies, we may still be barred from making, using and selling our product candidates or technologies because of the patent rights of others. Others have or may have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering compounds, assays, genes, gene products and therapeutic products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to genes, nucleic acids, polypeptides, chemical compounds or therapeutic products, and some of these may encompass reagents utilized in the identification of candidate drug compounds\nor compounds that we desire to commercialize. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the area of CNS disorders and the other fields in which we are developing product candidates. These could materially affect our ability to develop our product candidates or sell our products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or technologies may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nWe regularly conduct searches to identify patents or patent applications that may prevent us from obtaining patent protection for our proprietary compounds or that could limit the rights we have claimed in our patents and patent applications. Disputes may arise regarding the ownership or inventorship of our inventions. It is difficult to determine how such disputes would be resolved. Others may challenge the validity of our patents. If our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the inventions claimed in our patents.\nSome of our academic institutional licensors, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired. Additionally, any employee whose employment with us terminates, whether voluntarily by the employee or by us in connection with restructurings or otherwise, may seek future employment with our competitors. Although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire, we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. In addition, technology that we may license-in may become important to some aspects of our business. We generally will not control the patent prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of in-licensed technology.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of drug discovery and development of small molecule drugs, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties any confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates, technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If our drug development activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, protect our trade secrets or determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel\nformerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We also may not be able to afford the costs of litigation.\nThe patent applications of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s, or USPTO\u2019s, standards are uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings in the USPTO (and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office), which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. Similarly, opposition or invalidity proceedings could result in loss of rights or reduction in the scope of one or more claims of a patent in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, such interference, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any compensation to us or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. In particular, there have been proposals to shorten the exclusivity periods available under U.S. patent law that, if adopted, could substantially harm our business. The product candidates that we are developing are protected by intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications. If any of our product candidates becomes a marketable product, we will rely on our exclusivity under patents to sell the compound and recoup our investments in the research and development of the compound. If the exclusivity period for patents is shortened, then our ability to generate revenues without competition will be reduced and our business could be materially adversely impacted. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans and, in these countries, patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was recently signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has been in the process of implementing regulations and procedures to administer the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act may affect our ability to obtain, enforce or defend our patents. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nRisks Related to the Transfer of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to our Foreign Subsidiary\nWe may need to utilize all of our available net operating losses, and we may be subject to additional income taxes in connection with our transfer of certain intellectual property rights to our foreign subsidiary.\nIn September 2016, we licensed certain intellectual property rights to our wholly-owned Bermuda subsidiary, ITI Limited for $125 million and other consideration. The fair value of the intellectual property rights were determined by an independent third party. The proceeds from this license represented a prior year gain for U.S. tax purposes which was offset partially by prior year losses. However, the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, could challenge the valuation of the intellectual property rights and assess a greater valuation, which would require us to utilize a portion, or all, of our available NOLs at such time. If an IRS valuation exceeds our available NOLs, we could incur additional income taxes in the future. Our ability to use our NOLs is generally subject to the limitations of IRS Section 382, as well as expiration of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe will be subject to stringent regulation in connection with the marketing of any products derived from our product candidates, which could delay the development and commercialization of our products.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Neither we nor our collaborators can market a pharmaceutical product in the United States until it has completed rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product, and requires substantial resources. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, it may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, and/or marketing of such products, and requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the product or result in the incurrence of additional costs. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and continue our business.\nOutside the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Only after the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality, and efficacy has been presented will it grant a marketing authorization. Approval by the FDA does not automatically lead to the approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and, similarly, approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States will not automatically lead to FDA approval.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources and capital than us, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. If our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our product candidates, they may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and increasing. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors have products or are pursuing the development of drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that are the focus of our drug development programs.\nFor example, our potential products for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder would compete with, among other branded products including, Latuda\u00ae, marketed by Sunovion, Rexulti\u00ae marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, VRAYLAR\u00ae, marketed by Allergan, Saphris\u00ae marketed by Allergan and Fanapt\u00ae, marketed by\nVanda Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, will compete with, among other generic antipsychotic products, aripiprazole, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, quetiapine/XR, olanzapine and clozapine.\nMany of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:\n\u2022\nidentifying and validating targets;\n\u2022\nscreening compounds against targets;\n\u2022\npreclinical studies and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater capital and research and development resources, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, and production facilities. Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may develop superior technologies or methods to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer, more affordable, or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of biological, hazardous, and radioactive materials used in our business could be costly and delay our research and development efforts.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful hazardous materials, including volatile solvents, biological materials such as blood from patients that have the potential to transmit disease, chemicals that cause cancer, and various radioactive compounds. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We face the risk of contamination or injury from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, or production efforts. If one of our employees were accidentally injured from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials, the medical costs related to his or her treatment would be covered by our workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. However, we do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our general liability insurance policy specifically excludes coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be subject to criminal sanctions or fines or be held liable for damages, our operating licenses could be revoked, and we could be required to suspend or modify our operations and our research and development efforts.\nConsumers may sue us for product liability, which could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our available resources and damage our reputation.\nResearching, developing, and commercializing drug products entail significant product liability risks. Liability claims may arise from our and our collaborators\u2019 use of products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products. Consumers may make these claims directly and our collaborators or others selling these products may seek contribution from us if they receive claims from consumers. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials. Our product liability insurance coverage for clinical\ntrials is currently limited to an aggregate of $30 million. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Although we currently have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials, we will need to increase and expand this coverage if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale. This insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products that we or our collaborators develop. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our liability could exceed our total assets if we do not prevail in a lawsuit from any injury caused by our drug products.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nNumerous factors could result in substantial volatility in the trading price of our stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has ranged from a high of $25.82 to a low of $10.21. We have several stockholders, including affiliated stockholders, who hold substantial blocks of our stock. Sales of large numbers of shares by any of our large stockholders could adversely affect our trading price. If stockholders holding shares of our common stock sell, indicate an intention to sell, or if it is perceived that they will sell, substantial amounts of their common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\ntiming and announcement of regulatory developments, submissions and approvals or preliminary, interim or final results of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variation in our results of operations or the results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of medical innovations or new products or product candidates by our competitors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations for our stock;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the biopharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities in connection with raising additional capital or otherwise;\n\u2022\nany major change to the composition of our board of directors or management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nThe stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of biotechnology companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In several recent situations where the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, such as the purported class action lawsuits brought against us and certain of our executive officers in May 2017, consolidated in July 2017 and voluntarily dismissed in November 2017, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe will need to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private sales of our equity securities, sales of debt securities, the incurrence of debt from commercial lenders, strategic collaborations, licensing a portion or all of our product candidates and technology and, to a lesser extent, grant funding, although there can be no assurances such financing can be obtained. We filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective on September 14, 2016, on which we registered for sale up to $350 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, purchase contracts and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine. On October 2, 2017 and October 5, 2017, we completed our public offering of approximately $172 million of shares of our common stock registered on the universal shelf registration statement and received net proceeds of approximately $162 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. After the public offering in October 2017, approximately $178 million of securities remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. This registration statement will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it was declared effective. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nThe price of our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to meet our growth projections and expectations, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our business and the business of others in our industry. In addition, the stock market itself is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons related and unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC or the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other stock exchange or inter-dealer quotations system on which our common stock may be listed in the future. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we\nmust perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls or fail to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is and will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish or continue to publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, to the extent analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not continue to have or to obtain analyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who covers us or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we could lose, or never gain, visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions of the Delaware law, our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe provisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of our\ncontrol. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you should not rely on an investment in our securities if you require dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, you may not be able to re-sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
