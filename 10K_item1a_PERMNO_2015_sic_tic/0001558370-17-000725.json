RISK FACTORS\nRisks associated with our industry\nThe proliferation of payment options other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value debit cards, and mobile payments options could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of our ATMs.\nThe U.S., the U.K., and other developed markets have seen a shift in consumer payment trends since the late 1990\u2019s, with more customers now opting for electronic forms of payment (e.g., credit cards and debit cards) for their in-store purchases over traditional paper-based forms of payment (e.g., cash and checks). Additionally, some merchants offer free cash back at the point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) for customers that utilize debit cards for their purchases, thus providing an additional incentive for consumers to use these cards. According to the Nilson Report issued in December 2016, the percentage of cash transaction counts in the U.S. declined from approximately 33.8% of all payment transactions in 2010 to approximately 26.8% in 2015, with declines also seen in check usage as credit, debit, and stored-value debit card transactions increased. However, in terms of absolute dollar value, the volume of cash used in payment transactions remained relatively flat at $1.5 trillion from 2010 to 2015. On a same-store basis, we have seen a near flat rate of growth in the number of cash withdrawal transactions conducted on our U.S.-based ATMs and a slightly negative rate of growth in the number of cash withdrawals conducted on our U.K.-based ATMs during the last 12-24 months in recent periods. Additionally, with the January 6, 2017 completion of the acquisition of DCPayments, we now have substantial business operations in Canada and Australia. Our operations in both of these markets have experienced declining ATM transactions on a same-store basis over the last twelve months. The continued growth in electronic payment methods, such as mobile phone payments, could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and ultimately, a decline in the usage of ATMs. New payment technology, such as Venmo, and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, or other new payment method preferences by consumers could reduce the general population\u2019s need or demand for cash and negatively impact our\ntransaction volumes in the future. The proliferation of payment options and changes in consumer preferences and usage behavior could reduce the need for cash and have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nInterchange fees, which comprise a substantial portion of our transaction revenues, may be lowered in some cases at the discretion of the various EFT networks through which our transactions are routed, or through potential regulatory changes, thus reducing our future revenues.\nInterchange fees, which represented 37.3% of our total ATM operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, are set by the various EFT networks and major interbank networks through which the transactions conducted on our ATMs are routed. These fees vary from one network to the next. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 4% of our total ATM operating revenues were subject to pricing changes by U.S. networks over which we currently have limited influence or where we have no ability to offset pricing changes through lower payments to merchants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 21% of our total ATM operating revenues were derived from interchange revenues in the U.K., where the significant majority of the interchange revenues we earn are based on rates set by LINK, the major interbank network in that market, based on an annual cost-based study performed by an independent third-party organization. The remainder of reported interchange revenue reflects transaction-based revenues where we have contractually agreed to the rate with a financial institution or network. Accordingly, if some of the networks through which our ATM transactions are routed were to reduce the interchange rates paid to us or increase their transaction fees charged to us for routing transactions across their network, our future transaction revenues could decline.\nIn past years, certain networks have reduced the net interchange rates paid to ATM deployers for ATM transactions in the U.S. routed across their debit networks through a combination of reducing the transaction rates charged to financial institutions and higher per transaction fees charged by the networks to ATM operators. In addition to the impact of the net interchange rate decrease, we saw certain financial institutions migrate their volume away from some networks to take advantage of the lower pricing offered by other networks, resulting in lower net interchange rates per transaction to us.\nAdditionally, some consumer groups in the U.S. have expressed concern that consumers using an ATM may not be aware that, in addition to paying the surcharge fee that is disclosed to them at the ATM, their financial institution may also assess an additional fee with regard to that consumer\u2019s transaction. These fees are sometimes referred to as \u201cforeign bank fees\u201d or \u201cout of network fees.\u201d While there are currently no pending legislative actions calling for limits on the amount of interchange fees that can be charged by the EFT networks to financial institutions for ATM transactions or the amount of fees that financial institutions can charge to their customers to offset their interchange expense, there can be no assurance that such legislative actions will not occur in the future. Any potential future network or legislative actions that affect the amount of interchange fees that can be assessed on a transaction may adversely affect our revenues.\nOur U.K.-based revenues are also impacted by interchange rates, with the majority of our interchange revenues in that market being earned through the LINK network. LINK sets interchange rates for its participants using a cost-based methodology that incorporates ATM service costs, generally from two years back (i.e., operating costs from 2014 are considered for determining the 2016 interchange rate) and, as a result, the interchange rate can vary year-to-year based on the output of the cost-based study. We have seen the LINK interchange rate move both up and down based on the results of the cost study. While over time, we think this methodology generally enables us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable profit margin, large spikes in costs within a particular time period could adversely impact our profitability in this market as the interchange rates are currently fixed on a calendar year basis. In addition to LINK transactions, certain card issuers in the U.K. have issued cards that are not affiliated with the LINK network, and instead carry the Visa or MasterCard network brands. Transactions conducted on our ATMs from these cards, which currently represent 2% of our annual withdrawal transactions in the U.K., receive interchange fees that are set by Visa or MasterCard, respectively. The interchange rates set by Visa and MasterCard have historically been less than the rates that have been established by LINK. Accordingly, if any major financial institutions in the U.K. were to decide to leave the LINK network in favor of Visa, MasterCard, or another network, and we elected to continue to accept the transactions of their cardholders, such a move could reduce the interchange revenues that we currently receive from the related withdrawal transactions conducted on our ATMs in that market. Additionally, should LINK change its interchange-setting mechanism or should there be a significant change in the LINK scheme or its membership, our U.K. interchange revenues and profits could be adversely impacted. Currently, the LINK interchange rate-setting mechanism is under review with certain members of LINK taking positions arguing for a significantly lower interchange rate. To the extent the LINK interchange rate is lowered, financial institution\nparticipation within the network changes, or other changes occur that impact our ATM operations, our revenues and profits may be materially adversely impacted.\nFuture changes in interchange rates, some of which we have minimal or no control over, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a changing and unpredictable regulatory environment, which may harm our business. If we are subject to new regulations or legislation regarding the operation of our ATMs, we could be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with that regulation or legislation, which may reduce our net income and our profit margins.\nWith its initial roots in the banking industry, the U.S. ATM industry is regulated by the rules and regulations of the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in EFT systems. The vast majority of states have few, if any, licensing requirements. However, legislation related to the U.S. ATM industry is periodically proposed at the state and local level. In past years, certain members of the U.S. Congress called for a re-examination of fees that are charged for an ATM transaction, although no legislation was passed relative to these matters. As a part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created, and it is possible that this governmental agency could enact new or modify existing regulations that could have a direct or indirect impact on our business. For additional information related to this topic, see the risk factor entitled The passage of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our ATMs would severely impact our revenues and our operations below.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) requires that ATMs be accessible to and independently usable by individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired or wheel-chair bound persons. The U.S. Department of Justice issued accessibility regulations under the ADA that became effective in March 2012. Leading up to this deadline, we took measures to achieve compliance with the ADA for our ATMs, which required us to upgrade and replace a portion of our ATMs. It is possible that future similar regulations may require us to make more substantial expenditures and we may be forced to replace and or stop operating such ATMs until such time as compliance has been achieved.\nAdditionally, we have been subject to litigation in the past claiming discrimination against certain groups. For example, the National Federation of the Blind (the \u201cNFB\u201d) sought to require us to ensure that all of our ATMs are voice-guided. Effective May 2015, we entered into an amended and restated settlement agreement (the \u201cNew Agreement\u201d) with the NFB and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to resolve outstanding issues arising out of an earlier settlement agreement that pre-dated the issuance of the 2012 ADA accessibility regulations. This New Agreement provides for a process utilizing a court-appointed special master to certify compliance with accessibility features, such as voice guidance and braille stickers, as set forth in either the 2012 ADA regulations or the New Agreement. The New Agreement also calls for monitoring our compliance in the deployment and maintenance of such features on our ATMs and imposes prescribed liquidated damages if we fail to meet any specific requirement. Should we fail to meet the terms of the New Agreement, we could incur significant liquidated damages.\nIn the U.K., the ATM industry has historically been largely self-regulating. Most ATMs in the U.K. are part of the LINK network and must operate under the network rules set forth by LINK, which operates under the oversight of the Bank of England and its regulatory capacity. However, in March 2013, the U.K. Treasury department issued a formal recommendation to further regulate the U.K. payments industry, including LINK, the nation\u2019s primary ATM scheme. In October 2013, the U.K. government responded by establishing the new Payment Systems Regulator (\u201cPSR\u201d) to oversee any payment system operating in the U.K. and its participants. The new PSR became active in 2015. The PSR commissioned a review of LINK, which has caused several outcomes, including a separation of the processing component of LINK which required us to separately enter into new agreements for certain operational services and other areas under review that could potentially impact our operations.\nWe are also subject to various regulations in other jurisdictions that we operate in, including Germany, Poland, Spain, Ireland, Mexico, and Canada, and more recently, with the completion of the DCPayments and Spark acquisitions in January 2017, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Due to the numerous regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, there is substantial risk to ensuring consistent compliance with the existing regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. To the extent we are not successful in complying with the existing regulations, it may have an impact on our\nability to continue operating in such jurisdictions or adversely impact our profits. In addition, new legislation proposed in any of the jurisdictions that we operate in, or adverse changes in the laws that we are subject to, may materially affect our business through the requirement of additional expenditures to comply with that legislation or other direct or indirect impacts on our business. If regulatory legislation is passed in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we could be required to incur substantial expenditures or suffer adverse changes in our business which would reduce our net income.\nIf we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, which would adversely impact our revenues and our operations.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to security features, compatibility between systems and software and hardware components, consumer preferences, industry standards, and other factors, we regularly update the technology components, including software, on our ATMs. These technology upgrade efforts, in some cases, may result in downtime to our ATMs, and as a result, loss of transactions and revenues. Additionally, our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers will significantly affect our future success. Our ability to take advantage of opportunities in the market may require us to invest considerable resources adapting our organization and capabilities to support development of products and systems that can support new services or be integrated with new technologies and incur other expenses in advance of our ability to generate revenue from these products and services. These developmental efforts may divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, management time and attention from other matters, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new products or services on a timely basis. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of these products and services, or our new products and services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our operations.\nSecurity breaches, including the occurrence of a cyber-incident or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could harm our business by compromising merchant and cardholder information and disrupting our transaction processing services, thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers, business partners, and generally exposing us to liability.\nAs part of our transaction processing services, we electronically process and transmit cardholder information. If a cyber-incident (including accidental or intentional computer or network issues (such as phishing attacks, viruses, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware, or other similar issues)) impairs or shuts down one or more of our computing systems or our IT network, we may suffer harm from our customers, our business partners, the press, and the public at large. Furthermore, companies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted in recent years by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions. The technical and procedural controls we and our partners use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data security breaches or other cyber incidents. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers. Unauthorized access to our computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records, and could cause interruptions in our operations. Any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, expose us to liability including claims from merchants, financial institutions, and cardholders, and subject us to network fines. Further, we could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a security breach, including repairing system damage and increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel, each of which could divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay\ndamages and/or change our business practices. We maintain insurance intended to cover some of these risks. However, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems. As a global company, we could be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. An actual security breach or cyber-incident could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nComputer viruses or unauthorized software (malware) could harm our business by disrupting our transaction processing services, causing noncompliance with network rules, damaging our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers, and damaging our reputation causing a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders.\nComputer viruses or malware have rapidly spread over the Internet and could infiltrate our systems, thus disrupting our delivery of services, causing delays or loss of data or public releases of confidential data or making our applications unavailable, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our operations and cash flows. Although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network, they may be ineffective in preventing computer viruses or malware that could damage our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, cause our reputation to be damaged, require us to make significant expenditures to repair or replace equipment, or cause us to be in non-compliance with applicable network rules and regulations.\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory/standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe, along with our partners and customers in the financial services area, are subject to a number of laws and regulations. These laws, rules and regulations address a range of issues including data privacy and cyber security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, retention or transfer of data.\nIn the U.S., the rules and regulations to which we (directly or contractually through our banking partners or our marketers) may be subject include those promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state cybersecurity and breach notification laws, as well as regulator enforcement positions and expectations.\nThe European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) courts determined in late 2015 that the Safe Harbor mechanism which facilitated data sharing between the E.U. and the U.S. was not in fact compliant with the E.U. data protection regulations, requiring a new robust mechanism, the Privacy Shield. The E.U. authorities agreed to new General Data Protection Regulations (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in 2016. The GDPR provides heightened rights for individuals and increased sanctions for non-compliance with regulations. Additionally, the GDPR further introduces measures that will make data processing and sharing between our European-based businesses and our other businesses more difficult. As required by the GDPR, in 2016 we appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee and supervise our compliance with European data protection regulations.\nSuch government regulation (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing business. Federal, state, municipal and foreign governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, marketing online, the use of data to inform marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. New regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe ATM industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase, which may adversely affect our profit margins.\nThe ATM business is and can be expected to remain highly competitive. Our principal competition comes from independent ATM companies and financial institutions in all of the countries in which we operate. Our competitors could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining desirable locations for our ATMs, cause us to reduce the revenue generated by\ntransactions at our ATMs, or cause us to pay higher merchant fees, thereby reducing our profits. In addition to our current competitors, new and less traditional competitors may enter the market or we may face additional competition associated with alternative payment mechanisms and emerging payment technologies. Increased competition could result in transaction fee reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. As a result, the failure to effectively adapt our organization, products, and services to the market could significantly reduce our offerings to gain market acceptance, could significantly reduce our revenue, increase our operating costs, or otherwise adversely impact our operations and cash flows.\nThe passage of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our ATMs would severely impact our revenues and our operations.\nDespite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at ATMs in the U.S. since their introduction in 1996, consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees. Even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body (such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of Santa Monica, California), U.S. federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds. Although Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a provision that will limit the application of federal preemption with respect to state laws that do not discriminate against national banks, federal preemption will not be affected by local municipal laws, where such proposed bans or limits often arise. Additionally, some U.S. federal officials have expressed concern in previous years that surcharge fees charged by banks and non-bank ATM operators are unfair to consumers. For example, in 2010, an amendment proposing limits on the fees that ATM operators, including financial institutions, can charge consumers was introduced in the U.S. Senate, but was not ultimately included in the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act that was signed into law. We rely on transaction-based revenues in each of our markets and any regulatory fee limits that could be imposed on our transactions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits. If legislation were to be enacted in the future in any of our markets, and the amount we were able to charge consumers to use our ATMs was reduced, our revenues and related profitability would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if such limits were set at levels that are below our current or future costs to operate our ATMs, it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate under our current business model and adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.\nPotential new currency designs may require modifications to our ATMs that could impact our cash flows.\nIn the action styled: American Council of the Blind, et. al., v. Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury (Case #1:02-cv-00864) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the \u201cCourt\u201d) an order was entered that found that U.S. currencies (as currently designed) violated the Rehabilitation Act, a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability, as the paper currencies issued by the U.S. are identical in size and color, regardless of denomination. As a consequence of this ruling, the U.S. Treasury stated in its semi-annual status report filed with the Court in September 2012, that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (\u201cBEP\u201d) was making progress towards implementing the Secretary\u2019s decision to provide meaningful access to paper currency by: \u201c(i) adding a raised tactile feature to each Federal Reserve note that the BEP may lawfully redesign, (ii) continuing the BEP\u2019s program of adding large high-contrast numerals and different colors to each denomination that it may lawfully redesign, and (iii) implementing a supplemental currency reader distribution program for blind and other visually impaired U.S. citizens and legal residents.\u201d Of these three steps only the first materially affects the ATM industry. The BEP continues to research the raised tactile feature and is engaged in testing samples in conjunction with the Banknot Equipment Manufactures program; however, previous comments from the U.S. Treasury suggest that raised tactile features on currency are not expected to be in circulation prior to 2020. Until a selection is made and disclosed by the BEP, the impact, if any, this raised tactile feature on the notes will have on the ATM industry (including us), remains unknown. However, it is possible that such a change could require us to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, to modify our ATMs in order to store and dispense notes with raised tactile features.\nAdditionally, polymer notes were introduced by the Bank of England in 2016 and will be further circulated through 2020. The introduction of these new currency designs has required upgrades to software and physical ATM components on our ATMs in the U.K. Upgrades may result in incremental downtime and incremental capital investments for the affected ATMs. These upgrades will continue during 2017. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse financial or operational impact as a result of the new requirements to handle these new notes but we have not yet completed the upgrade of our ATMs. The Reserve Bank of Australia has also begun issuing redesigned banknotes beginning with the $5 Australian dollar banknote in September 2016, and it will continue issuing redesigned banknotes in additional\ndenominations in subsequent years. The redesigned banknotes include a raised tactile feature to help the blind and visually impaired community distinguish between different denominations of banknotes and a top-to-bottom clear window in which the banknote is transparent. The new banknotes may require upgrades to the software and physical ATM components on our ATMs in Australia, and until all denominations of the banknotes have been released and are available for testing, we may not be able to determine the full upgrade requirements and related costs. Any required upgrades to our ATM machines could require us to incur additional cost, which could be substantial and have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nRisks associated with our business\nWe depend on ATM and financial services transaction fees for substantially all of our revenues, and our revenues and profits would be reduced by a decline in the usage of our ATMs or a decline in the number of ATMs that we operate, whether as a result of global economic conditions or otherwise.\nTransaction fees charged to cardholders and their financial institutions for transactions processed on our ATMs and multi-function financial services kiosks, including surcharge and interchange transaction fees, have historically accounted for most of our revenues. We expect that transaction fees, including fees we receive through our bank-branding and surcharge-free network offerings, will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our future operating results will depend on many factors, including: (i) the market acceptance of our services in our target markets, (ii) the level of transaction fees we receive, (iii) our ability to install, acquire, operate, and retain ATMs, (iv) usage of our ATMs by cardholders, and (v) our ability to continue to expand our surcharge-free and other automated consumer financial services offerings. If alternative technologies to our services are successfully developed and implemented, we may experience a decline in the usage of our ATMs. Surcharge rates, which are largely market-driven and are negotiated between us and our merchant partners, could be reduced over time. Further, growth in surcharge-free ATM networks and widespread consumer bias toward these networks could adversely affect our revenues, even though we maintain our own surcharge-free offerings. Many of our ATMs are utilized by consumers that frequent the retail establishments in which our ATMs are located, including convenience stores, gas stations, malls, grocery stores, drug stores, airports, train stations, and other large retailers. If there is a significant slowdown in consumer spending, and the number of consumers that frequent the retail establishments in which we operate our ATMs declines significantly, the number of transactions conducted on those ATMs, and the corresponding transaction fees we earn, may also decline. Additionally, should banks increase the fees they charge to their customers when using an ATM outside of their network (i.e. out of network or foreign bank fees), this would effectively make transactions at our ATM more expensive to consumers and could adversely impact our transaction volumes and revenues. A decline in usage of our ATMs by cardholders or in the levels of fees received by us in connection with this usage, or a decline in the number of ATMs that we operate, would have a negative impact on our revenues and cash flows and would limit our future growth potential. For additional information related to interchange fees, see the risk factor entitled Interchange fees, which comprise a substantial portion of our transaction revenues, may be lowered in some cases at the discretion of the various EFT networks through which our transactions are routed, or through potential regulatory changes, thus reducing our future revenues above.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 39.2% of our total revenues from ATMs placed at the locations of our top five merchant customers. Our top five merchant customers were 7-Eleven, Co-op Food (in the U.K.), Walgreens, CVS, and Speedway. Our ATM placement agreement with 7-Eleven in the U.S., which is currently the largest merchant customer in our portfolio, comprised approximately 18% of our total revenues for the year. The next four largest merchant customers together comprised approximately 21% of our total revenues for the year. 7-Eleven did not renew its ATM placement agreement with us, which expires in July 2017. We are currently in the process of coordinating the transition of ATM operations at 7-Eleven locations in the U.S. to the new service provider. At this time, we expect the transition to begin in July 2017 and occur over the latter part of 2017. As a result, we expect that our revenues and operating profits associated with this relationship will begin to decline during our third quarter. We expect that the loss of 7-Eleven\nwill likely have a higher negative impact (in percentage terms) on our income from operations relative to the revenue impact, particularly as we transition to the new service provider and the infrastructure required to support the relationship adjusts during the transition period. As a result, we expect that the loss of this merchant will have a significant negative impact on our results from operations and cash flows in 2017 and 2018.\nThe deinstallation of the 7-Eleven ATMs in the U.S., which we expect to start in the third quarter of 2017, will have a significant impact on many elements of our business operations. In addition to the anticipated loss of revenues and profits associated with this relationship, we expect other impacts as we plan to restructure certain parts of our business to offset the loss of profits associated with this relationship. For example, we expect to eliminate certain positions, which will likely result in higher upfront costs from severance and transition. Additionally, the net book value of the U.S. 7-Eleven ATMs is approximately $19.8 million as of December 31, 2016, and while we expect to reuse the majority of the ATMs with significant carrying values, we could incur a write-off or increased depreciation expense in the future if we are unable to redeploy the ATMs. Furthermore, the timing of the deinstallation schedule is still uncertain as of the date of the filing of this 2016 Form 10-K, and a significant change in the anticipated deinstallation schedule could have a significant impact on our expected results from operations during 2017.\nBecause a significant percentage of our future revenues and operating income depends upon the successful continuation of our relationship with our top merchant customers the loss of any of our largest merchants, a decision by any one of them to reduce the number of our ATMs placed in their locations, or a decision to sell or close their locations could result in a decline in our revenues or otherwise adversely impact our business operations. Furthermore, if their financial conditions were to deteriorate in the future, and as a result, one or more of these merchants was required to close a significant number of their store locations, our revenues would be significantly impacted. Additionally, these merchants may elect not to renew their contracts when they expire. As of December 31, 2016, the contracts we have with our top five merchant customers, other than 7-Eleven in the U.S., had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 4 years, including the Walgreens contract extension announced in January 2017.\nEven if our major contracts are extended or renewed, the renewal terms may be less favorable to us than the current contracts. If any of our largest merchants enters bankruptcy proceedings and rejects its contract with us, fails to renew its contract upon expiration, or if the renewal terms with any of them are less favorable to us than under our current contracts, it could result in a decline in our revenues and profits and have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nDeterioration in global credit markets, as well as changes in legislative and regulatory requirements, could have a negative impact on financial institutions that we conduct business with.\nWe have a significant number of customer and vendor relationships with financial institutions in all of our key markets, including relationships in which those financial institutions pay us for the right to place their brands on our ATMs. Additionally, we rely on a small number of financial institution partners to provide us with the cash that we maintain in our Company-owned ATMs and some of our merchant-owned ATMs. Volatility in the global credit markets, such as that experienced in 2008 to 2009, may have a negative impact on those financial institutions and our relationships with them. In particular, if the liquidity positions of the financial institutions with which we conduct business deteriorate significantly, these institutions may be unable to perform under their existing agreements with us. If these defaults were to occur, we may not be successful in our efforts to identify new bank-branding partners and vault cash providers, and the underlying economics of any new arrangements may not be consistent with our current arrangements. Furthermore, if our existing bank-branding partners or vault cash providers are acquired by other institutions with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), or placed into receivership by the FDIC, it is possible that our agreements may be rejected in part or in their entirety.\nWe rely on third-parties to provide us with the cash we require to operate many of our ATMs. If these third-parties were unable or unwilling to provide us with the necessary cash to operate our ATMs, we would need to locate alternative sources of cash to operate our ATMs or we would not be able to operate our business.\nIn North America, we rely primarily on Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Elan (a division of U.S. Bancorp), and Capital One to provide us with the vault cash that we use in approximately 44,000 of our ATMs where cash is not provided by the merchant. In Europe, we rely primarily on Santander, RBS, HSBC, and Barclays to provide us with the vault cash that we\nuse in approximately 16,000 of our ATMs. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we had an average outstanding vault cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion held in our North America ATMs and approximately $1.2 billion in our ATMs in Europe.\nOur existing vault cash rental agreements expire at various times through March 2021. However, each provider has the right to demand the return of all or any portion of its cash at any time upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain bankruptcy events of us or our subsidiaries, or a breach of the terms of our vault cash provider agreements. Other key terms of our agreements include the requirement that the vault cash providers provide written notice of their intent not to renew. Such notice provisions typically require a minimum of 180 to 360 days\u2019 notice prior to the actual termination date. If such notice is not received, then the contracts will typically automatically renew for an additional one-year period.\nIf our vault cash providers were to demand return of their cash or terminate their arrangements with us and remove their cash from our ATMs, or if they fail to provide us with cash as and when we need it for our operations, our ability to operate our ATMs would be jeopardized, and we would need to locate alternative sources of vault cash or potentially suffer significant downtime of our ATMs. In the event this was to happen, the terms and conditions of the new or renewed agreements could potentially be less favorable to us, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, restrictions on access to cash to fill our ATMs could severely restrict our ability to keep our ATMs operating, and could subject us to performance penalties under our contracts with our customers. A significant reduction in access to the necessary cash to operate our ATMs could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on EFT network providers, transaction processors, armored courier providers, and maintenance providers to provide services to our ATMs. If some of these providers that service a significant number of our ATMs fail or otherwise cease or no longer agree to provide their services, we could suffer a temporary loss of transaction revenues, incur significant costs or suffer the permanent loss of any contract with a merchant or financial institution affected by such disruption in service.\nWe rely on EFT network providers and have agreements with various transaction processors, armored courier providers, and maintenance providers. These providers enable us to provide card authorization, data capture, settlement, cash management and delivery, and maintenance services to our ATMs. Typically, these agreements are for periods of two or three years each. If we are unable to secure the renewal or replacement of any expiring vendor contracts, or a key vendor fails or otherwise ceases to provide the services for which we have contracted and disruption of service to our ATMs occurs, our relationship with those merchants and financial institutions affected by the disrupted ATM service could suffer.\nWhile we have more than one provider for each of the critical services that we rely on third-parties to perform, certain of these providers currently provide services to or for a significant number of our ATMs. Although we believe we would be able to transition these services to alternative service providers, this could be a time-consuming and costly process. In the event one of such service providers was unable to deliver services to us, we could suffer a significant disruption in our business, which could result in a material adverse impact to our financial results. Furthermore, any disruptions in service in any of our markets, whether caused by us or by third-party providers, may result in a loss of revenues under certain of our contractual arrangements that contain minimum service-level requirements and could result in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nIf we, our transaction processors, our EFT networks or other service providers experience system failures, the products and services we provide could be delayed or interrupted, which would harm our business.\nOur ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our EFT transaction processing platforms, third-party transaction processors, telecommunications network systems, and other service providers. Accordingly, any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of revenues and profits. Additionally, if any interruption is caused by us, especially in those situations in which we serve as the primary transaction processor, such interruption could result in the loss of the affected merchants and financial institutions, or damage our relationships with them. Our systems and operations and those of our transaction processors and our EFT network and other service providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, unlawful acts, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, and computer viruses, among other things. We cannot be certain that any measures we and our service providers have taken to prevent system failures\nwill be successful or that we will not experience service interruptions. Should a significant system failure occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nOur armored transport business exposes us to additional risks beyond those currently experienced by us in the ownership and operation of ATMs.\nOur armored courier operation in the U.K. delivers cash to and collects residual cash from our ATMs in that market. As of December 31, 2016, we were providing armored courier services to approximately 13,500 of our ATMs in that market and we currently intend to further expand that operation to service additional ATMs. The armored transport business exposes us to significant risks, including the potential for cash-in-transit losses, employee theft, as well as claims for personal injury, wrongful death, worker\u2019s compensation, punitive damages, and general liability. While we seek to prevent the occurrence of these risks and we maintain appropriate levels of insurance to adequately protect us from these risks, there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant future claims or adverse publicity related thereto. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover potential liabilities or that insurance coverage will remain available at costs that are acceptable to us. The availability of quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to successfully operate this aspect of our operations. A loss claim for which insurance coverage is denied or that is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOperational failures in our EFT transaction processing facilities could harm our business and our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers.\nAn operational failure in our EFT transaction processing facilities could harm our business and damage our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers. Damage or destruction that interrupts our transaction processing services could also cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment and could damage our relationship with our customers. We have installed back-up systems and procedures to prevent or react to such disruptions. However, a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours (i.e., where our backup systems are not able to recover) could result in data loss or a reduction in revenues as our ATMs would be unable to process transactions. In addition, a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential merchant and financial institution customers to choose alternative service providers, as well as subject us to fines or penalties related to contractual service agreements and ultimately cause a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nErrors or omissions in the settlement of merchant funds could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and expose us to liability.\nWe are responsible for maintaining accurate bank account information for certain of our merchant customers and accurate settlements of funds into these accounts based on the underlying transaction activity. This process relies on precise and authorized maintenance of electronic records. Although we have controls in place to help ensure the safety and accuracy of our records, errors or unauthorized changes to these records could result in the erroneous or fraudulent movement of funds, thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers and exposing us to liability and potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates could increase our operating costs by increasing interest expense under our credit facilities and our vault cash rental costs.\nInterest on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility is based on a floating interest rate, and our vault cash rental expense is based primarily on floating interest rates. As a result, our interest expense and cash management costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates. We pay a monthly fee on the average outstanding vault cash balances in our ATMs under floating rate formulas based on a spread above various LIBOR in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, and Spain. In Mexico, the rate is based on the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (commonly referred to as the \u201cTIIE\u201d), in Canada, the rate is based on the Bank of Canada\u2019s Bankers Acceptance Rate and the Canadian prime rate, and in Australia, the formula is based on the Bank Bill Swap Rates (\u201cBBSY\u201d). Although we currently hedge a portion of our vault cash interest rate risk related to our operations in the U.S. through December 31, 2022 by using interest rate swap\ncontracts, we may not be able to enter into similar arrangements for similar amounts in the future. We have also entered into interest rate swap contracts in the U.K. through December 31, 2022 to hedge a portion of our vault cash interest rate risk in that market. Any significant future increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flow by increasing our operating costs and expenses. For additional information, see Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\nWe maintain a significant amount of cash within our Company-owned ATMs, which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events, including natural disasters.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, our average outstanding vault cash balance was approximately $3.5 billion in our ATMs. Any loss of cash from our ATMs is generally our responsibility. We typically require that our service providers, who either transport the vault cash or otherwise have access to the ATM safe, maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of theft, misconduct, or negligence on the part of such providers. Cash losses at the ATM occur in a variety of ways, such as natural disaster (hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.), fires, vandalism, and physical removal of the entire ATM, defeating the interior safe or by compromising the ATM\u2019s technology components. Because our ATMs are often installed at retail sites, they face exposure to attempts of theft and vandalism. Thefts of cash may be the result of an individual acting alone or as a part of a crime group. We have experienced theft of cash from our ATMs across the geographic regions in which we operate. During the fourth quarter of 2013, in response to increased physical ATM theft attempts and lower profitability on certain ATMs in Mexico, we removed a number of ATMs from service for a period of time to enhance some security features. While we maintain insurance policies to cover a significant portion of any losses that may occur that are not covered by the insurance policies maintained by our service providers, such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions, and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of those losses. Significant cash losses could result in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nAny increase in the frequency and/or amounts of theft and other losses could negatively impact our operating results by causing higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums. Additionally, any damage sustained to our merchant customers\u2019 store locations in connection with any ATM-related thefts, if extensive and frequent enough in nature, could negatively impact our relationships with those merchants and impair our ability to deploy additional ATMs in those existing or new locations of those merchants. Certain merchants have requested, and could request in the future, that we remove ATMs from store locations that have suffered damage as a result of ATM-related thefts, thus negatively impacting our financial results. Finally, we have in the past, and may in the future, voluntarily remove cash from certain ATMs on a temporary or permanent basis to mitigate further losses arising from theft or vandalism. Depending on the magnitude and duration of any cash removal, our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe election of our merchant customers to not participate in our surcharge-free network offerings could impact the effectiveness of our offerings, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nFinancial institutions that are members of the Allpoint network pay a fee in exchange for allowing their cardholders to use selected Company-owned and/or managed ATMs on a surcharge-free basis. The success of the Allpoint network is dependent upon the participation by our merchant customers in that network. In the event a significant number of our merchants elect not to participate in that network, the benefits and effectiveness of the network would be diminished, thus potentially causing some of the participating financial institutions to not renew their agreements with us, and thereby negatively impacting our financial results.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate our future acquisitions, which could increase our cost of operations, reduce our profitability, or reduce our shareholder value.\nWe have been an active business acquirer and expect to continue to be active in the future. The acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks. The core risks are in the areas of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence) and integration (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company\u2019s personnel, products, processes, technology, and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition).\nThe process of integrating operations is time consuming and could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of the companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds, and combining different corporate cultures. Further, if we cannot successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our consolidated financial statements may be impaired and we may not be able to meet our reporting obligations under applicable law. Any such impairment or failure could cause investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common shares, to be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, even if we are able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost efficiency or synergies, or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time. We may be required to invest significant capital and resources after an acquisition to maintain or grow the business that we acquire. Further, acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows. Any shortfall in anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows could require us to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with any acquired company, which would adversely affect our reported earnings.\nSince May 2001, we have acquired numerous ATM businesses, a surcharge-free ATM network, a technology product offering that complements our surcharge-free offering, an ATM installation company in the U.K., a Scotland-based provider and developer of marketing and advertising software and services for ATM owners, a U.K.-based provider of secure cash logistics and ATM maintenance, and a transaction processor in the U.S. We have made acquisitions to obtain the assets of deployed ATM networks and the related businesses and their infrastructure, as well as for strategic reasons to enhance the capability of our ATMs and expand our service offerings. We currently anticipate that our future acquisitions, if any, will likely reflect a mix of asset acquisitions and acquisitions of businesses, with each acquisition having its own set of unique characteristics. In the future, we may acquire businesses outside of our traditional areas, which could introduce new risks and uncertainties. To the extent that we elect to acquire an existing company or the operations, technology, and the personnel of the company, we may assume some or all of the liabilities associated with the acquired company and face new and added challenges integrating such acquisition into our operations.\nOn January 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of DCPayments with significant operations in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. Due to the size of the acquisition, which is the largest in our history, and the complexity involved to manage and integrate the business across several geographic locations, there are special risks involved with this particular acquisition. To the extent that we are unable to successfully operate or integrate this business, we could incur additional costs or suffer an impairment in the valuation of the business.\nWe operate in many sovereign jurisdictions across the globe and expect to continue to grow our business in new regions. Operating in different countries involves special risks and our geographic expansion may not be successful, which would result in a reduction of our gross and net profits.\nUpon completion of the DCPayments acquisition on January 6, 2017 and the Spark acquisition on January 31, 2017, we have operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. We expect to continue to expand in the countries in which we currently operate, and potentially into other countries as opportunities arise. We currently report our consolidated results in U.S. dollars and under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Operating in various distinct jurisdictions presents a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to currency fluctuations, including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the U.S. dollar, which represents our consolidated reporting currency. Recently our reported results have been significantly adversely impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies where we operate and in particular, the British pound;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of exchange controls, which could impair our ability to freely move cash;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in complying with the different laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate, including unique labor and reporting laws and restrictions on the collection, management, aggregation, and use of information;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in laws, regulations, and policies of foreign governments or other regulatory bodies, including changes that could potentially disallow surcharging or that could result in a reduction in the amount of interchange or other transaction-based fees that we receive;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated political and social instability that may be experienced;\n\u00b7\nrising crime rates in certain of the areas we operate in, including increased incidents of crimes on our ATMs and against store personnel where our ATMs are located;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including hiring and retaining skilled workers in those countries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\ndecreased ATM usage related to decreased travel and tourism in the markets that we operate in;\n\u00b7\nexposure to corruption in jurisdictions where we operate; and\n\u00b7\npotential adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of foreign earnings.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse impact on us and reduce the revenues and profitability derived from our international operations and thereby adversely impact our consolidated operations and cash flows.\nThe U.K. referendum result in favor of exit from the European Union could adversely affect us and our shareholders.\nIn a referendum held on June 23, 2016, British citizens approved an exit of the U.K. from the E.U. As a significant portion of our operations are located in the U.K. and our parent company is incorporated in the U.K., we face potential risks associated with the exit process and effects and uncertainties around its implementation. The U.K. Government is currently progressing legislation that would result in it triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union, notifying the European Council of the U.K.\u2019s intention to leave. This notification will begin a two-year time period for the U.K. and the remaining E.U. member states to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. There can be no certainty as to the form or timing of any withdrawal agreement. In relation to our redomicile into the U.K., the exit process from the E.U. and implementation of the resulting changes could materially and adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal, and regulatory regime and macro-economic environment in which we operate. In relation to our other European operations and businesses, we face similar risks. The effect of any of these risks, were they to materialize, is difficult to quantify, but could materially increase our operating and compliance costs and materially affect our tax position or business, results of operations, and financial position. Further, uncertainty around the form and timing of any withdrawal agreement could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the U.K., other parts of Europe, and the rest of the world, which could have an adverse economic impact on our operations. The U.K.\u2019s planned exit has recently impacted foreign currency exchange rates. As a substantial portion of our business is U.K.-based, if the British pound remains weak or further weakens, relative to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, it will adversely impact our reported results from operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues and profits from bank-branding relationships with financial institutions. A decline in these revenues as a result of changes in financial institution demand for this service may have a significant negative impact to our results.\nBank-branding drives a significant portion of our revenues, and if this product offering were to become less attractive to financial institutions whereby we lost a significant amount of existing contracts, it could have a material impact on our revenues and profits. In addition, consolidations within the banking industry may impact our bank-branding relationships as existing bank-branding customers are acquired by other financial institutions, some of which may not be existing bank-branding customers. Our bank-branding contracts could be adversely affected by such consolidations.\nIf we experience impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets, we will be required to record a charge to earnings, which may be significant.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform periodic assessments for any possible impairment for accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of $654.3 million, or 47.9% of our total assets. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of DCPayments, completed on\nJanuary 6, 2017, we expect to add a substantial amount of additional goodwill and other intangible assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability and the amortization period of our intangible assets under U.S. GAAP. Some of the factors that we consider to be important in assessing whether or not impairment exists include the performance of the related assets relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. These factors and assumptions, and any changes in them, could result in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. In the event we determine our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements, which would negatively impact our results of operations and that impact could be material.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, and make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding indebtedness was $502.5 million, which represents 52.4% of our total book capitalization of $959.5 million. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of DCPayments, completed on January 6, 2017, we added a substantial amount of additional indebtedness to finance the purchase of this business. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow in the future to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy, research and development costs, or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. We cannot assure shareholders that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings, including those under our credit facilities, will be available in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness. If we do not have sufficient earnings or capital resources to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money, delay investment and capital expenditures, or sell equity or debt securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes include a number of covenants that, among other items, restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsell or transfer property or assets;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase shares;\n\u00b7\nmerge into or consolidate with any third-party;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur, assume, or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate certain liens;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nissue or sell preferred shares of restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nIn addition, we are required by our credit agreement to adhere to certain covenants and maintain specified financial ratios. While we currently have the ability to borrow the full amount available under our credit agreement, as a result of these ratios, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business in the future and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance our future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. A failure to comply with the covenants or financial ratios could result in an event of default. In the event of a default under our credit agreement, the lenders could exercise a number of remedies, some of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the senior notes. An acceleration of indebtedness under our credit agreement would also likely result in an event of default under the terms of any other financing arrangement we have outstanding at the time. If any or all of our debt were to be accelerated, we cannot assure shareholders that our assets would be sufficient to repay our indebtedness in full. If we are unable to repay any amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility when due, the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral securing our indebtedness. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows. For additional information related to our credit agreement and indentures, see Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Facilities.\nThe fundamental change and make-whole fundamental change provisions associated with our $250.0 million of 1.00% convertible senior notes due December 2020 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow holders of our Convertible Notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain other circumstances may delay or prevent a takeover of us or the removal of current management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if relevant, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as described in our convertible indentures, and our debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or required purchase of the Convertible Notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of our Convertible Notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change purchase consideration specified within the convertible note indentures. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase consideration if holders submit their Convertible Notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due if holders surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion. In addition, the occurrence of a fundamental change may cause an event of default under agreements governing us or our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness. Agreements governing any future debt may also restrict our ability to make any of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash (if any) due upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be in default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due upon conversion.\nNoncompliance with established EFT network rules and regulations could expose us to fines and penalties and could negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, new EFT network rules and regulations could require us to expend significant amounts of capital to remain in compliance with such rules and regulations.\nOur transactions are routed over various EFT networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances. These networks include Star, Pulse, NYCE, Cirrus (MasterCard), and Plus (Visa) in the U.S., and LINK in the U.K., among other networks. We utilize various other EFT networks in our other geographic locations. EFT networks\nset the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions, as well as the amounts paid to us. Additionally, EFT networks, including MasterCard and Visa, establish rules and regulations that ATM providers, including ourselves, must comply with in order for member cardholders to use those ATMs. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could expose us to penalties and/or fines, which could negatively impact our financial results. The payment networks rules and regulations are generally subject to change and they may modify their rules and regulations from time to time. Our inability to react to changes in the rules and regulations or the interruption or application thereof, may result in the substantial disruption of our business.\nIn October 2016, MasterCard commenced a liability shift for U.S. ATM transactions on EMV-issued cards used at non-EMV-compliant ATMs in the U.S. We are currently in the process of upgrading our U.S. Company-owned ATMs to enable the EMV standard and also deploy additional software to enhance our ATM functionality and security. Due to the significant operational challenges of enabling EMV and other hardware and software enhancements across the majority of our U.S. ATMs, which comprises many types and models of ATMs, together with potential compatibility issues with various processing platforms, we have recently and may continue to experience increased downtime in our U.S. ATMs in 2017. As a result of this potential downtime, we could suffer lost revenues or incur penalties with certain of our contracts. We also may incur increased charges from networks associated with actual or potentially fraudulent transactions and may also incur additional administrative overhead costs to support the handling of an increased volume of disputed transactions. We also may experience a higher rate of unit count or transaction attrition for our merchant-owned ATMs and ATMs for which we process transactions, as a result of this standard, as we may elect to entirely block certain ATMs or certain transaction types for merchant-owned ATMs that are not EMV-enabled in the future. Visa has also announced plans for a liability shift to occur starting in October 2017 for all transaction types on all EMV-issued cards in the U.S. Noncompliance with the EMV standard or other network rules could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe majority of the electronic debit networks over which our transactions are conducted require sponsorship by a bank, and the loss of any of our sponsors and our inability to find a replacement may cause disruptions to our operations.\nIn each of the geographic segments in which we operate, bank sponsorship is required in order to process transactions over certain networks. In all of our markets, our ATMs are connected to financial transaction switching networks operated by organizations such as Visa and MasterCard. The rules governing these switching networks require any company sending transactions through these switches to be a bank or a technical service processor that is approved and monitored by a bank. As a result, the operation of our ATM network in all of our markets depends on our ability to secure these \u201csponsor\u201d arrangements with financial institutions. In the U.S., our largest geographic segment by revenues, bank sponsorship is required on the significant majority of our transactions and we rely on our sponsor banks for access to the applicable networks. In the U.K., only international transactions require bank sponsorship. In Mexico, all ATM transactions require bank sponsorship, which is currently provided by our banking partners in the country. In Canada and Germany, bank sponsorships are also required and are obtained through our relationships with third-party processors. If our current sponsor banks decide to no longer provide this service, or are no longer financially capable of providing this service as may be determined by certain networks, it may be difficult to find an adequate replacement at a cost similar to what we incur today, or potentially, we could incur a temporary service disruption for certain transactions in the event we lose or do not retain bank sponsorship, which may negatively impact our profitability and may prevent us from doing business in that market.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing automated consumer financial services industry, and the geographical segments in which we operate. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of several of our senior executives would have an adverse effect on our operations, if we are not able to find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner. Unexpected turnover in key leadership positions within the Company may adversely impact our ability to manage the Company efficiently and effectively, could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of existing personnel, any of which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse change in our reputation, whether as a result of decreases in revenue or a decline in the market price of our common shares, could affect our ability\nto motivate and retain our existing employees and recruit new employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage, motivate and retain other qualified management, as well as technical and operational personnel as we grow. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations across many jurisdictions, changes to which could increase our costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct business in many countries. As a result, we are subject to laws and regulations which affect our operations in a number of areas. Laws and regulations affect our business in many ways including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nWe operate in several jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-corruption laws.\nOur business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from paying or promising to pay government officials, political parties, or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining, retaining, influencing, or directing business. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nOur employees and agents may interact with government officials on our behalf, including interactions necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business, import or export equipment and resolve tax disputes. These interactions create a risk that actions may occur that could violate the FCPA or other similar laws.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations as well as U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, contractors and agents will abide by our policies. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws in international jurisdictions, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Additionally, if we face claims of infringement we may be forced to incur costly litigation.\nOur success depends, in part, on developing and protecting our intellectual property. We rely on copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on other confidentiality and contractual agreements and arrangements with our employees, affiliates, business partners and customers to establish and protect our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights. While we expect these agreements and arrangements to be honored, we cannot assure shareholders that they will be and, despite our efforts, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by, competitors. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. Any litigation\nrelating to the defense of our intellectual property, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nIn addition, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations. We may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our customers against third party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a customer which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay royalties to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be required to enter into a license agreement and pay license fees, or we may be required to stop using the technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable amount of time. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nWe are subject to business cycles, seasonality, and other outside factors that may negatively affect our business.\nOur overall business is subject to seasonal variations. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during those months as a result of decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. With the majority of our ATMs located in the northern hemisphere, we expect to see slightly higher transactions in the warmer summer months from May through August, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. As a result of these seasonal variations, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares. In addition, a recessionary economic environment could reduce the level of transactions taking place on our networks, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nU.K. regulatory approval of the DCPayments acquisition has not yet been obtained, delaying expected synergies in the U.K.; failure to obtain such approval could weaken the financial performance of the DCPayments acquisition under our ownership.\nWe are pursuing regulatory approval of the DCPayments acquisition with the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the \u201cCMA\u201d). Our ability to extract expected synergies from the combined U.K. business is delayed until such approval is obtained. The CMA only has oversight over the U.K. portion of the acquisition, which accounted for approximately 17% of DCPayments\u2019 consolidated revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In order to secure approval from the CMA, we may be required to divest certain ATMs or self-impose other conditions, and any such divestment or other conditions could negatively impact the performance of the acquisition.\nCardtronics plc may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income taxes in the event our redomicile to the U.K. is successfully challenged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d).\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Because Cardtronics plc is incorporated under English law, it should be considered a U.K., and not a U.S., tax resident under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the Code provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. that acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. (including through a merger) will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (i) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80% (of either the voting power or value) of the share of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition and (ii) the acquiring foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities in the country in which the acquiring foreign corporation is organized relative to the expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities (\u201csubstantial business activities\u201d or the \u201cSBA Test\u201d). Pursuant to the Redomicile Transaction, Cardtronics plc indirectly acquired all of Cardtronics Delaware\u2019s assets, and Cardtronics Delaware shareholders held 100% of the value of Cardtronics plc by virtue of their prior share ownership of Cardtronics Delaware immediately after the Redomicile Transaction. As a result, the Cardtronics plc expanded affiliated group (which includes Cardtronics Delaware and its subsidiaries) must have had substantial business activities in the U.K.\nfor Cardtronics plc to avoid being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. In order for the Cardtronics plc expanded affiliated group to have satisfied the SBA Test, at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), assets, and gross income of such group must have been based, located, and derived, respectively, in the U.K. as of the dates and for relevant periods under the Code sections.\nCardtronics plc believes it fully satisfied the SBA Test and performed rigorous analysis to support this conclusion. However, the application of Section 7874 of the Code is not entirely clear in all situations, and while we believe the SBA Test was fully satisfied, there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree. Furthermore, there have been legislative proposals to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and there could be changes to the Code (including Section 7874 of the Code) or the U.S. Treasury Regulations that could result in Cardtronics plc being treated as a U.S. corporation or otherwise have adverse consequences. Such statutory or regulatory provisions could have retroactive application.\nIf it were determined that Cardtronics plc should be taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Cardtronics plc could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income taxes. Additionally, the U.K. could continue to tax Cardtronics plc as a U.K. tax resident for U.K. tax purposes, and thus Cardtronics plc and its shareholders could be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and the U.K.\nCertain expected benefits of the Redomicile Transaction may not be realized.\nU.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, and the IRS have aggressively objected to outbound redomiciliation transactions and have expressed a strong desire to prevent them with broad-based rules. Certain of these objections could limit our ability to efficiently engage in certain transactions after the Redomicile Transaction (including, potentially, entering into agreements and closing acquisitions of unrelated U.S. target companies in consideration for Ordinary Shares (as defined in Item 1. Business - Organizational and Operational History) of Cardtronics plc for at least 36 months after the Redomicile Transaction). Additionally, future changes in English law, its tax rates, its territorial taxation system, its \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d rules, its tax treaties or otherwise, and changes in the U.S. tax system (including the scope, basis, and rate of taxation), could also adversely impact the benefits that we expect to achieve from having completed the Redomicile Transaction.\nThe Redomicile Transaction may not allow us to effectively manage our tax risks and costs.\nWe cannot provide any assurances as to what our ongoing tax costs and rate will be because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws. Our actual effective tax costs and rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the U.K. and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our tax costs and our worldwide effective tax rate.\nWe also could be subject to audits conducted by tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could significantly impact our tax costs and rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits, and other matters could cause our effective tax rate to increase and our results of operations to suffer.\nRisks associated with our common shares\nOur operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future, which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the ATM and financial services industries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumers\u2019 preferences for cash as a payment vehicle;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of our retail partners;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and magnitude of operating expenses, capital expenditures, and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, and operations, including as a result of acquisitions, if any;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements associated with the ATM and financial services industries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of our current services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers;\n\u00b7\nany adverse results in litigation by us or by others against us;\n\u00b7\nour inability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness as they become due;\n\u00b7\nour failure to successfully enter new markets or the failure of new markets to develop in the time and manner we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions, strategic alliances, or joint ventures involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nterrorist acts, theft, vandalism, fires, floods, or other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the financial condition and operational execution of our key vendors and service providers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax rates or tax policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\nexposure to currency fluctuations, including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the U.S. dollar, which represents our consolidated reporting currency.\nAny of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. A relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and interest expense. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. Additionally, beginning in July 2017, the loss of our current largest customer, 7-Eleven in the U.S., will have a material adverse impact on our financial results. As such, comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance.\nWe may issue additional common shares or instruments convertible into common shares, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the trading price of our Convertible Notes.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common shares or other securities convertible into our common shares to fund acquisitions, finance operations or for general corporate purposes. In addition, we may elect to settle the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes in common shares, and we may also issue common shares under our equity awards programs. The market price of our common shares or the trading price of the Convertible Notes could decrease significantly if we conduct such future offerings, if any of our existing shareholders sells a substantial amount of our common shares or if the market perceives that such offerings or sales may occur. Moreover, any issuance of additional common shares will dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders, and may adversely affect the ability of holders of our Convertible Notes to participate in any appreciation of our common shares.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, such as our Convertible Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes, and that original issue discount is amortized into interest\nexpense over the term of the Convertible Notes using an effective yield method. As a result, we are required to record non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the effective original issue discount to the Convertible Notes\u2019 face amount over the term of the notes. Accordingly, we report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the Convertible Notes\u2019 coupon interest.\nUnder certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the notes are accounted for as if the number of common shares that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be certain that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur articles of association include mandatory offer provisions that may be viewed as less favorable to shareholders, including with respect to takeover matters.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, certain provisions similar to the mandatory offer provisions and certain other aspects of the U.K. Takeover Code were specifically approved and included in our articles of association that were adopted at the special meeting of shareholders of Cardtronics Delaware held in June 2016 in connection with the Redomicile Transaction. As a result, except as permitted by our articles of association, (including acquisitions with the consent of our Board of Directors or with prior approval by the independent shareholders at a general meeting) a shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, would be at risk of certain Board of Directors sanctions if they acquired 30% or more of our issued shares without making a voluntary offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares (not already held by the acquirer) that is in cash (or accompanied by a full cash alternative) and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the U.K. Takeover Code (as if the U.K. Takeover Code applied to us). The ability of shareholders to retain their shares upon completion of an offer for our entire issued share capital may depend on whether the Board of Directors subsequently agrees to propose a court-approved scheme of arrangement that would, if approved by our shareholders, compel minority shareholders to transfer or surrender their shares in favor of the offeror or, if the offeror acquires at least 90% of the shares. In that case, the offeror can require minority shareholders to accept the offer under the \u2018squeeze-out\u2019 provisions in our articles of association. The mandatory offer provisions in our articles of association could have the effect of discouraging the acquisition and holding of interests of 30% or more of our issued shares and encouraging those shareholders who may be acting in concert with respect to the acquisition of shares to seek to obtain the recommendation of our Board of Directors before effecting any additional purchases. In addition, these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our shares or inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could otherwise result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nEnglish law generally provides for increased shareholder approval requirements with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nEnglish law provides that a board of directors may generally only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders and such authorization must specify the maximum nominal value of the shares that can be allotted and can be granted for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or the relevant shareholder resolution. English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash. It is possible, however, for the articles of association, or shareholders in a general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights, if coupled with a general authorization to allot shares. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, as applicable.\nEnglish law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of \u201coff market purchases\u201d without the prior approval of shareholders by ordinary resolution (i.e., majority of votes cast). Such authority can be granted for a maximum period of up to five years. English law prohibits us from conducting \u201con market purchases\u201d as our shares will not be traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K.\nPrior to the Redomicile Transaction, resolutions were adopted to authorize the allotment of a certain amount of shares, exclude certain preemptive rights and permit off market purchases of up to 15% of our shares in issue immediately after the effective time of the Redomicile Transaction, but these authorizations will expire in 2021 unless renewed by our shareholders prior to the expiration date.\nWe cannot assure shareholders that situations will not arise where such shareholder approval requirements for any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial capital management benefits.\nEnglish law requires that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and repurchase shares.\nWe do not currently have the ability to declare dividends in any material amount. Under English law, with limited exceptions, we will only be able to declare dividends or repurchase shares out of \u201cdistributable reserves\u201d on Cardtronics plc\u2019s stand-alone balance sheet, without regard to its consolidated financial statements. While we have no current plans for future dividend payments or share repurchases, in order to create distributable reserves we may at a future annual meeting of shareholders offer a resolution to approve a proposed reduction of capital and, upon approval, undertake a customary court-approved capital reduction procedure in the U.K. that would enable the payment of dividends or share repurchases if and when determined by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 92457, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "CATM"}
