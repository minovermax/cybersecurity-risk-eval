{"cik": "1171014", "company": "COSI INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nDuring our operating history, we have been unable to achieve profitability.\nIn fiscal 2015, we incurred net losses of approximately $15.7 million, and, since we were formed, we have incurred net losses of approximately $325.8 million through the end of fiscal 2015, primarily due to funding operating losses, which have included significant impairment charges, costs associated with closing restaurants, early lease termination fees, and new restaurant opening expenses. We cannot predict whether we will be able to achieve or sustain revenue growth, profitability or positive cash flow in the future. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the financial results through December 28, 2015.\nIf internally generated cash flow from our restaurants does not meet our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur cash resources, and therefore our liquidity, are highly dependent upon the level of internally generated cash from operations and upon future financing transactions. Although we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital requirements for the next twelve months, if cash flows from our existing restaurants or from franchise fees and royalties do not meet our expectations or are otherwise insufficient to satisfy our cash needs, we may have to seek additional financing from external sources to continue funding our operations or reduce or cease our plans to open new restaurants. We cannot predict whether any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms.\nOur business has in the past required, and may continue to require, significant additional capital to, among other things, fund our operations, increase the number of Company-owned restaurants, attract new franchisees and expand franchise operations, expand the range of services we offer, and finance future acquisitions and investments. There is no assurance that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to achieve our planned expansion. If we or our franchisees are unable to successfully open new restaurants, our revenue growth rate and profits may be reduced.\nTo successfully expand our business, we and our franchisees must open new restaurants on schedule and in a profitable manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in restaurant openings and may experience similar delays in the future. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could hurt our ability to meet our growth objectives, which may affect the expectations of securities analysts, investors, and others and thus our stock price. We cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably. Further, any restaurants that we, or our franchisees, open may not obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 locating suitable restaurant sites in new and existing markets;\n\u2022 negotiating acceptable lease terms;\n\u2022 obtaining financing, or obtaining financing on acceptable terms, for new restaurant development;\n\u2022 generating positive cash flow from existing and new restaurants;\n\u2022 successful operation and execution in new and existing markets;\n\u2022 recruiting, training and retaining qualified corporate and restaurant personnel and management;\n\u2022 attracting and retaining qualified franchisees with sufficient experience and financial resources to develop and operate our restaurants successfully;\n\u2022 cost-effective and timely planning, design and build-out of restaurants;\n\u2022 the reliability of our customer and market studies;\n\u2022 the reliability of our site identification studies;\n\u2022 consumer trends;\n\u2022 obtaining and maintaining required local, state, federal and where applicable, foreign governmental approvals and permits related to the construction and operation of the sites and the sale of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022 creating customer awareness of our restaurants in new markets;\n\u2022 competition in our markets, both in our business and in locating suitable restaurant sites;\n\u2022 the cost of our principal food products and supply and delivery shortages or interruptions;\n\u2022 weather conditions; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions.\nWe must identify and obtain a sufficient number of suitable new restaurant sites for us to achieve a sustainable revenue growth rate.\nWe require that all proposed restaurant sites, whether Company-owned or franchised, meet site-selection criteria established by us. We and our franchisees may not be able to find sufficient new restaurant sites to support our planned expansion in future periods. We face significant competition from other restaurant companies and retailers for sites that meet our criteria, and the supply of sites may be limited in some markets. As a result of these factors, our costs to obtain and lease sites may increase, or we may not be able to obtain certain sites due to unacceptable costs. Our inability to obtain suitable restaurant sites at reasonable costs may reduce our growth rate, which may affect the expectations of securities analysts and others and thus our stock price.\nOur expansion in existing markets can cause sales in some of our existing restaurants to decline, which could result in restaurant closures.\nAs part of our expansion strategy, we and our franchisees intend to open new restaurants in our existing markets. Since we typically draw customers from a relatively small radius around each of our restaurants, the sales performance and customer counts for restaurants near the area in which a new restaurant opens may decline due to competition from the new restaurant, which could result in restaurant closures. In addition, new restaurants added in existing markets may not achieve the same operating performance as our existing restaurants.\nOur expansion into new markets, both foreign and domestic, may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area. The restaurants we open in new geographic regions may not achieve market acceptance.\nSome of our new franchised restaurants are located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different demographic characteristics, competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets that may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. An additional risk in expansion into new markets is the lack of market awareness of the Cosi\u00ae brand. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant-level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach mature average annual Company-owned restaurant sales, if at all, thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants.\nWe have an international license agreement with a licensee for the development of Cosi\u00ae restaurants in six countries in the Persian Gulf. This licensee currently operates one franchise locations in the United Arab Emirates. We also have an international license agreement with a licensee in Costa Rica who currently operates six franchised restaurants there and is exploring further expansion in other markets. As these franchise locations and future foreign locations open, the Company's international operations will be subjected to various factors of uncertainty. The Company's business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, local economic conditions, differing cultures and consumer preferences, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations\nof rights and obligations in connection with international license agreements and the collection of royalties from international licensees, the availability and cost of land and construction costs, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate licensees, and joint venture partners. Although we believe that we have developed the support structure required for international growth in these countries, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.\nWe may not be able to successfully incorporate a franchising and area developer model into our strategy.\nWe have and will continue to incorporate a franchising and area developer model into our business strategy in certain selected markets. We may not be successful in attracting franchisees and developers to the Cosi\u00ae concept or identifying franchisees and developers that have the business abilities or access to financial resources necessary to open our restaurants or to successfully develop or operate our restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards. Incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy also requires us to devote significant management and financial resources to support the franchise of our restaurants. Our future performance will depend on our franchisees\u2019 ability to execute our concept and capitalize upon our brand recognition and marketing. Our franchisees may not be able to operate restaurants in a profitable manner. If we are not successful in incorporating a franchising or area developer model into our strategy, we may experience delays in our growth or may not be able to expand and grow our business.\nIf our franchisees cannot develop or finance new restaurants, build them on suitable sites or open them on schedule, our growth and success may be impeded.\nOur growth depends in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain a successful and effective franchise program and to attract qualified franchisees. If our franchisees are unable to locate suitable sites for new restaurants, negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms, obtain the necessary financial or management resources, meet construction schedules or obtain the necessary permits and government approvals, our growth plans may be negatively affected. We cannot assure you that any of the restaurants our franchisees open will be profitable.\nAdditional foodservice strategic alliances may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may decide to enter into alliances with third parties to develop foodservice strategic alliances in select markets or through select channels. Identifying strategic partners, negotiating agreements and building such alliances may divert management\u2019s attention away from our existing businesses and growth plans. If we are not successful in forming additional foodservice strategic alliances, we may experience delays in our growth and may not be able to expand and grow our business. If we do form strategic alliances, we cannot assure you that the restaurants opened pursuant to these strategic alliances will be profitable.\nAny inability to manage our growth effectively could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business. We intend to grow in the future both through a franchising strategy and opening new Company-owned restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls. We must attract and retain talented operating personnel to maintain the quality and service levels at our existing and future restaurants. We may not be able to effectively manage these or other aspects of our expansion. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions, our business could be negatively impacted. Any acquisitions may also be costly.\nWe may consider future strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties assimilating new operations and products. In addition, acquisitions may require significant management time and capital resources. We cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms, that any acquisition would result in long-term benefits to us, or that management would be able to manage effectively the resulting business. Future acquisitions are likely to result in the incurrence\nof additional indebtedness, which could contain restrictive covenants, or the issuance of additional equity securities, which could dilute our existing stockholders. We may also pay too much for a concept that we acquire relative to the actual economic return obtained. If our integration efforts are unsuccessful, our business and results of operations could suffer.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have recorded goodwill related to our acquisitions to date and a portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire in the future may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or other intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at annually. Factors that may constitute a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in the industry we operate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to execute our business strategy, we could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations;\n\u2022 identification and availability of suitable restaurant sites;\n\u2022 competition for restaurant sites and customers;\n\u2022 negotiation of favorable leases;\n\u2022 management of construction and development costs of new and renovated restaurants;\n\u2022 securing required governmental approvals and permits;\n\u2022 recruitment and retention of qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022 successful operation and execution in new and existing markets;\n\u2022 recruiting, training and retaining qualified corporate and restaurant personnel and management;\n\u2022 identification of under-performing restaurants and our ability to improve or efficiently close under-performing restaurants, including securing favorable lease termination terms;\n\u2022 the rate of our internal growth, and our ability to generate increased revenue from existing restaurants;\n\u2022 our ability to incorporate a franchising and area developer model into our strategy;\n\u2022 competition in new and existing markets;\n\u2022 the reliability of our customer and market studies;\n\u2022 the impact of general economic conditions, particularly in geographic regions that contain a high concentration of our restaurants;\n\u2022 the cost of our principal food products and supply and delivery shortages or interruptions;\n\u2022 changes in commodity costs, labor, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs;\n\u2022 availability of additional capital and financing;\n\u2022 weather conditions; and\n\u2022 general regional, national and foreign economic conditions.\nEach of these factors could delay or prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy, which could adversely affect our growth, revenues and our results of operations.\nEconomic conditions in the United States and globally could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nIf the economic conditions deteriorate, many sectors of the economy may be adversely impacted. During periods of economic downturn, continuing disruptions in the overall economy, including the impacts of high unemployment and financial market volatility and unpredictability, may cause a related reduction in consumer confidence, which could negatively affect customer traffic and sales throughout our industry. As a retailer that depends upon consumer discretionary spending, we could face a challenging fiscal year if our customers make fewer discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices. Our restaurants may be disproportionably affected by a significant decrease in customer traffic or lower average check prices as a result of customers switching to lower-priced products on our menu or dining out less frequently. If negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or become pervasive, consumer changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including the frequency with which they dine out, could be more permanent. Deterioration in the economic environment could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to raise additional capital if needed or to maintain satisfactory credit terms with our suppliers.\nInclement weather and other variable factors may adversely affect our sales and results of operations and could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur business is subject to significant weather influences on consumer spending and dining-out patterns. Inclement weather may result in reduced frequency of dining at our restaurants or lost restaurant visits. Customer counts (and consequently revenues) are generally highest in spring and summer months and lowest during the winter months because of the high proportion of our restaurants located in the Northern part of the country where inclement winter weather affects customer visits. As a result, our quarterly and yearly results have varied in the past, and we believe that our quarterly operating results will vary in the future. Other factors such as unanticipated increases in labor, commodities, energy, insurance or other operating costs may also cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For this reason, you should not rely upon our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nFranchisees are independent operators and are not our employees. We have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, and our franchisees are obligated to operate their restaurants according to certain guidelines. However, we do not control our franchisees. We cannot assure that our franchisees will adhere to our guidelines or that there will not be differences in product quality, operations, marketing or profitability. Additionally, franchisees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements and may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Poor restaurant operations may affect each restaurant\u2019s sales. Our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of our franchisees, may suffer materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline if our franchisees do not operate successfully.\nWe could face liability from our franchisees.\nA franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationships. Various state, federal and, where applicable, foreign and international laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and potential sales of our franchised restaurants. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. Expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees.\nOur financial results are affected by the financial results of our franchisees.\nWe receive royalties from our franchisees. Our financial results are therefore to an extent contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees, including implementation of our strategic plans, as well as their ability to secure adequate financing. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees, their financial health may worsen and our collection rates may decline. Additionally, refusal on the part of franchisees to renew their franchise agreements may result in decreased royalties. Entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future.\nOur restaurants are currently concentrated in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, particularly in the New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia areas. Accordingly, we are highly vulnerable to negative occurrences in these regions.\nWe currently operate 79 Company-owned restaurants in Northeastern, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic states, of which 23 are located in the New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia central business districts. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in these areas. In addition, given our geographical concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences outside our control such as acts of terrorism, and natural disasters.\nYou should not rely on past average unit volumes as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly.\nA number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our average unit sales, including, among other factors:\n\u2022 our ability to execute our business and growth strategy effectively;\n\u2022 success of promotional and marketing initiatives, including advertising and new product and concept development;\n\u2022 sales performance by our new and existing restaurants;\n\u2022 management turnover in the restaurants;\n\u2022 competition;\n\u2022 general regional, national, and foreign economic conditions;\n\u2022 weather conditions; and\n\u2022 the impact of the general economic conditions and high unemployment rates on consumer spending, particularly in geographic regions that contain a high concentration of our restaurants.\nMaterial changes in our average unit volumes could cause the profitability of the restaurant portfolio and the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nIf we do not continue to meet the listing standards established by The NASDAQ Capital Market, the common stock may not remain listed for trading.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market has established certain quantitative criteria and qualitative standards that companies must meet in order to remain listed for trading on these markets. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain all necessary requirements for listing; therefore, we cannot guarantee that our common stock will remain listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market or to the similar markets.\nWe are subject to the continued listing criteria of Nasdaq and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.\nOn November 24, 2015, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification letter stated that we would be afforded 180 calendar days, or until May 16, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price for its common stock between now and May 16, 2016, and will consider all available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. If we are unable to resolve the deficiency, our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with governmental regulations in one or more of the following areas or if these regulations change, our business could suffer.\nEmployment and Immigration Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family and other leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome, and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance.\nWe may from time to time be audited for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well. Various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time may consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. This may subject us to fines or penalties, and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees.\nThe comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. We are evaluating the impact the new law will have on us, and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have, we expect that the requirement that we provide more extensive health benefits to employees than we currently do could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general. As a result of this law, we may see an increase in health insurance that may be large enough to materially impact our labor costs. Alternatively, if we choose not to provide the required health insurance or if some employees do not qualify for the required insurance, our employee culture may be harmed and we may face adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand.\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top-performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence, and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws\nWe are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. Although the costs that we have incurred in the past in connection with ADA-related complaints have not been material, we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications, or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.\nNutrition and Food Regulation\nIn recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry, including nutrition, labeling and advertising practices. Fast-casual and casual dining chains have been a particular focus. For example, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include caloric or other nutritional information on their menu boards and on printed menus, or make other nutrition information available, which must be plainly visible to consumers at the point of ordering. Nationwide nutrition disclosure included in the U.S. health care reform law\nwill go into effect December 1, 2016, and we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line, decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.\nPrivacy/Cybersecurity\nWe are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees, and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, and by the European Union and its member states, and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. At the same time, we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf. If the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third-party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees. We did not have any known cybersecurity issues during fiscal 2015.\nLocal Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation\nEach of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. If we fail to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses, we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations. In addition, our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes in some states. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. Although we take significant precautions to ensure that all employees are trained in the responsible service of alcohol and maintain insurance policies in accordance with all state regulations regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages, the misuse of alcoholic beverages by customers may create considerable risks for us. If we are the subject of a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nThe effect of recent changes to U.S. healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe offer eligible full-time and part-time U.S. employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, changes that became effective in 2014, and especially the employer mandate and employer penalties that became effective January 1, 2015, may increase our labor costs significantly. Changes in the law that took effect in 2014, including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage, may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans increasingly finding it advantageous to do so, which may increase our healthcare costs in the future. In 2015, we adopted a qualifying plan under the Affordable Care Act for our full-time hourly employees, which may further increase our healthcare expenses. It is also possible that even in light of recent changes in the healthcare plans we offer, healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees. And, in any event, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us, and those costs may increase over time. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nGeneral Business Risks\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, and proprietary rights to certain of our core menu offerings. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We, therefore, devote appropriate\nresources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. The protective actions that we take, however, may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which might cause us to incur significant litigation costs and could harm our image or our brand or competitive position.\nWe also cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that our trademarks or offerings infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hold significant amounts of illiquid assets and may have to dispose of them on unfavorable terms.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2015 we had approximately $11.9 million in net fixed assets that we have defined as illiquid assets, which include leasehold improvements, equipment, and furniture and fixtures. These assets cannot be converted into cash quickly and easily. We may be compelled, based on a significant underperformance of a specific location or market, to dispose of some illiquid assets on unfavorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business. Our customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Cosi\u00ae restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Cosi\u00ae restaurant. We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal, state and, where applicable, foreign law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. We could also become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future.\nRegardless of whether any future claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert our management's attention away from our operations and hurt our performance. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services or those of our franchisees, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.\nIf we are unable to protect our customers\u2019 credit card data, we could be exposed to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.\nIn connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information securely over public networks. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.\nWe rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business. Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may adversely affect the operation of the business and our results of operations.\nComputer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have a new management team that does not have proven success with the Company.\nOur new Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer and Vice President of Operations joined the Company on May 11, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. These new members of management have limited experience with us, and we cannot assure you that they will fully integrate themselves into our business or that they will effectively manage our business affairs. Our failure to assimilate the new members of management, the failure of the new members of management to perform effectively, or the loss of any of new members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Food Service Industry\nOur business is affected by changes in consumer preferences.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food and beverage products, our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers and what we believe is an emerging trend in consumer preferences toward fast casual restaurants. We depend on consumers who prefer made-to-order food in a sophisticated environment and are willing to pay a premium price for our products. We also depend on trends toward consumers eating away from home more often. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or cuisine, our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business and future profitability.\nNatural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or other armed conflict, or the threat of such actions, on the United States or international economies may cause a decline in discretionary consumer spending, which would negatively affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic and political conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Discretionary consumer spending may decline in the event of a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism or other armed conflict. Accordingly, we may experience a decline in sales during periods of uncertainty like the one that followed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. In addition, economic uncertainty due to military action overseas, such as the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other military, diplomatic or financial responses, may lead to further declines in sales. Any decline in consumer spending or economic conditions could reduce customer traffic or impose practical limits on pricing, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business and financial condition. In the event of a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, or the threat of either, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many well-established food service companies on the basis of taste, quality and price of product offered, customer service, atmosphere, location and overall customer experience. We compete with other sandwich retailers, specialty coffee retailers, bagel shops, fast-food restaurants, delicatessens, cafes, bars, take-out food service companies, supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change with each daypart (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack), ranging from coffee bars and bakery cafes during the breakfast and lunch dayparts to casual dining chains during the dinner daypart. Aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our sales and profit margins.\nMany of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing and the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can. As competitors expand their operations, we expect competition to intensify. We also compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may be subject to higher labor costs.\nChanges in food and supply costs and availability could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur restaurants receive frequent deliveries of products. Most of these deliveries are made by distributors who are part of a national network of independent distributors with whom we have a distribution agreement. These independent distributors supply us with approximately 80% of our food and paper products under an agreement which expires in December 2020. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs, such as the volatility in certain commodity markets we experienced in recent years. Certain commodities, such as wheat, coffee, poultry, beef, fresh produce, and dairy and dairy-related products, have experienced significant\nfluctuations in the recent past. These types of increases could have an adverse effect on us during fiscal 2016 and in future fiscal years. Although many of our products are made to our specifications, we believe that alternative distribution sources are available for the majority of our ingredients and products.\nWe believe that we have adequate sources of supply for our ingredients and products to support our restaurant operations and, if necessary, we can make menu modifications to address any material supply issues. However, there are many factors which can cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and products, including weather, unanticipated demand, labor, production or distribution problems, quality issues and cost, some of which are beyond our control, and any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nHealth concerns relating to the consumption of beef, poultry, produce or other food products could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry, produce, and other food products, consumer preferences and our results of operations and stock price.\nOutbreaks of avian flu (bird flu) or other food-borne illnesses, such as \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d E.coli, salmonella, or hepatitis A, could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other food products. As a result, we could experience a significant increase in cost of food.\nIn addition, like other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of poultry, beef, or produce, the key ingredients in many of our menu items, or by negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury generally, such as negative publicity concerning, E.coli, salmonella, \u201cmad cow disease\u201d or \u201cbird flu\u201d, publication of government or industry findings about food products we serve or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from the food served in our restaurants. Our operational controls and training may not be fully effective in preventing all food-borne illnesses. Some food-borne illness incidents could be caused by food suppliers and transporters and would be outside of our control. If our food suppliers and transporters do not comply with governmental health regulations, they may not be able to deliver food products or we may be subject to food product recalls. Any negative publicity, health concerns or specific outbreaks of food-borne illnesses attributed to one or more of our restaurants, or the perception of an outbreak, could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business, financial condition and stock price.\nThe food service industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause customers to avoid our products and result in liabilities.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from buying our products. We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us or if we incur litigation costs, regardless of the result.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and employees. Increased labor costs, due to factors like additional taxes, or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs, including the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, (discussed further under \u201cRegulatory and Legal Risks - The effect of recent changes to U.S. healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results,\u201d), as well as competition, increased minimum wage requirements, paid sick leave or other paid leave or vacation accrual mandates, and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating expenses. In addition, our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff, to keep pace with our needs. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 89567, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "COSIQ"}
