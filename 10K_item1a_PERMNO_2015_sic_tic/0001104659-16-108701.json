Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business model has changed significantly several times since our inception in response to a constantly changing and evolving market, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects, and may expose us to increased risks and uncertainties.\nOur business has evolved substantially over time through organic growth, strategic acquisitions and divestitures. We started operating in the energy efficiency services business in June 2006, when we launched our commercial and industrial energy efficiency services business. In 2008, we made an acquisition that gave us access to the public sector energy efficiency market. In late 2009, we won our first utility energy efficiency contract and began to build this new business. In 2011, we scaled back our original commercial and industrial business and combined it with our public sector business, and in February 2013 we sold the public sector business. Accordingly, we have only a limited history of generating revenues under our current business model, and the future revenue potential of our current business model in the rapidly evolving energy efficiency solutions market is uncertain. As a result of our short operating history under our current business model, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our business, strategies, performance and prospects or an investment in our common stock. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history under our current business model and the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies with new business models. To address these risks and uncertainties, among other things, we must do the following:\n\u00b7 maintain and expand our current utility relationships and develop new relationships;\n\u00b7 maintain, enhance and add to our existing energy efficiency solutions;\n\u00b7 execute our business and marketing strategies successfully;\n\u00b7 attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and\n\u00b7 respond to competitive developments.\nWe may be unable to accomplish one or more of these objectives, which could cause our business to suffer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, accomplishing many of these goals might be very expensive, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any predictions about our future operating results may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history under our current business model.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced annual losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception and we currently have an accumulated deficit. We must continue to increase sales while maintaining or\nimproving our margins to operate profitably and sustain positive operating cash flows. We may be required to reduce the prices of our services in order to win new contracts or retain existing contracts. If we reduce prices, we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to achieve acceptable profit margins. As we strive to grow our business, we have spent and expect to continue to spend significant funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, marketing, recruiting and hiring additional personnel. To the extent that our revenues do not increase as quickly as these costs and expenditures, our results of operations and liquidity will be adversely affected. If we experience slower than anticipated revenue growth or if the margins we earn on our sales are lower than expected or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, we may not achieve profitability in the future or if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital to fund future operating losses.\nBecause of our negative cash flow, we have funded our operations through the issuance of common and preferred stock and debt. Our ability to continue to operate until our cash flow turns positive on a consistent basis may depend on our ability to continue to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt. We may not be able to raise additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are not successful in raising any needed additional funds, we might have to significantly scale back or delay our growth plans, seek to sell the Company or cease operations altogether. Any reduction or delay in our growth plans could materially adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace, take advantage of business opportunities and develop or enhance our services and technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating us and the results of that investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation of our revenue recognition practices and financial reporting in September 2012. If, as a result of that investigation, the SEC takes action against us or our officers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt is difficult for us to estimate our future quarterly operating results.\nDespite the sale of our public sector business in 2013, our revenues have remained somewhat seasonal. Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the last two quarters of each year. In addition, utility contracts can be subject to changes in budget allocations for the programs. In the past, we experienced a situation where funds allocated for a program we were operating under were diverted to other uses with no warning, reducing our expected revenue under the program. As a result, we may be unable to forecast our revenue accurately, and a failure to meet our revenue or expense forecasts could have an immediate and negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and if we are unable to compete successfully our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe energy efficiency solutions market is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase and intensify as the energy efficiency solutions market continues to evolve. We face strong competition primarily from other providers of energy efficiency solutions, local electrical and mechanical contractors and engineering firms, lighting and lighting fixture manufacturers and lighting fixture distributors. We compete primarily on the basis of client service and support, quality and scope of services and products, including proprietary technology, cost of services and products, name recognition and our performance track record for services provided.\nIn addition to our existing competitors, new competitors such as large national or multinational engineering and/or construction companies could enter our markets. Many of these current and potential competitors are better capitalized than we are, have longer operating histories and strong existing client relationships, greater name recognition, and more extensive engineering, technology and sales and marketing capabilities. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy efficiency solutions that may be potentially more attractive to clients than our products or services. In addition, we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity. Our competitors may also offer energy efficiency solutions at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain clients, require us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive, and reduce our revenue and profitability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain other skilled personnel, and the loss of their services or our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business or to maintain profitable operations.\nOur future success will depend largely on the skills, efforts, and motivation of our executive officers and other senior managers. The loss of the service of executive officers and other senior managers or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business, implement our strategy or maintain profitable operations.\nIn addition, to execute our growth strategy and maintain our margins, we must attract and retain other skilled personnel with an extensive understanding of the energy efficiency regulatory framework and an effective sales force that can accurately price and manage our clients\u2019 energy efficiency solution contracts. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense. If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend upon a limited number of utility contracts to generate substantially all of our revenue.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from thirteen utility contracts. In 2015, four of these contracts generated 69% of our total revenues. While these contracts are typically multi-year, the utilities are required to re-bid them at the end of their terms; therefore, our ability to retain these contracts is not assured. It is also possible that utilities could have a change of strategy for achieving their energy efficiency goals, de-emphasizing the small-business direct install programs under which we currently operate. A utility could also decide to reduce the incentives available to small businesses under a program, thereby reducing the effectiveness of our sales efforts. The loss of, or substantial reduction in, sales to any of our utility clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of our subcontractors to properly and effectively perform their services in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our energy efficiency solutions.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide quality, reliable energy efficiency solutions in a timely manner, which in part requires the proper removal and installation of lighting, mechanical and electrical systems and other products by the subcontractors upon which we depend. Almost all of our energy efficiency solutions are installed by contractors or subcontractors. Any delays, malfunctions, inefficiencies or interruptions in the installation of our energy efficiency solutions caused by our subcontractors could put us at risk of a utility terminating a contract prematurely, jeopardize our ability to\nretain a contract when it comes up for renewal, and harm our reputation in the marketplace. Such delays could also result in additional costs that could affect the profit margin of our projects.\nIf our information technology systems fail, or if we experience operation interruptions, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems generally to manage the day-to-day operation of our business, manage relationships with our clients and maintain our financial and accounting records. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain and enhance our information technology systems, or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our information technology systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, disrupt our business and make us unable, or severely limit our ability, to respond to client demands. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7 earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7 employee or other theft;\n\u00b7 attacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u00b7 power outages; and\n\u00b7 computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, client dissatisfaction and lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nProduct liability and personal injury claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face exposure to product liability and personal injury claims in the event that our energy efficiency solutions cause bodily injury or property damage. Since the majority of our products use electricity, it is possible that the products we sell could result in injury, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, we face exposure to personal injury claims in the event that an individual is injured as a result of our negligence or the negligence of one of our subcontractors. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. A successful product liability or personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials and at times requires that our contractors or subcontractors work in hazardous conditions, either of which could give rise to a claim against us.\nWhen we retrofit a client\u2019s facility, we assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We utilize licensed and insured hazardous waste disposal companies to remove and/or dispose of such components. Failure to properly handle, remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability against us, or could expose our workers, our subcontractor\u2019s workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us. Further, our workers and subcontractor\u2019s workers are sometimes required to work in hazardous environments that present a risk of serious personal injury which could result in claims against us. A successful personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of\nour available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to additional limitation, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We have sold or otherwise issued shares of our common stock in various transactions sufficient to constitute an ownership change, including our public offering in 2009, the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock (as discussed below), and the conversion of all of our outstanding Series A & B preferred stock in 2014 and the conversion of all of our then-outstanding convertible notes in 2014. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards, which amounted to $140 million as of December 31, 2015, to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will likely result in increased future tax liability. Future shifts in our equity ownership, including transactions in which we may engage, may cause additional equity ownership changes, which could have the effect of imposing additional limitations on our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards. In addition, these limitations could cause us not to pursue otherwise favorable acquisitions or other transactions involving our capital stock, or could reduce the net benefits to be realized from any such transactions.\nAcquisitions and dispositions may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have made significant acquisitions and dispositions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions and dispositions. We may face significant competition for acquisition opportunities and there can be no assurance that anticipated acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk. These transactions may also affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThese transactions also involve risks, including:\n\u00b7 an acquisition may not result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;\n\u00b7 we may fail to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our operations and internal controls;\n\u00b7 the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or we may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks;\n\u00b7 any disposition may result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow; and\n\u00b7 use of cash for acquisitions may adversely affect cash available for capital expenditures and other uses.\nOur failure to comply with covenants contained in our loan agreements could trigger prepayment obligations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur loan agreements with our creditors, Heritage Commerce Bank (\u201cHeritage Bank\u201d) and Bison Capital Partners IV, L.P. (\u201cBison\u201d), contain various business and financial covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, dispose of or sell our assets, consolidate or merge with other entities; incur additional indebtedness, create liens on our assets, make investments, etc. In the future, we may also enter\ninto other loan agreements or debt arrangements containing similar or different restrictive covenants. Complying with these covenants could limit our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur loan agreements also require us to comply with certain minimum consolidated EBITDA covenants, but our ability to meet these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Failing to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the loan agreements, which could result in us being required to repay the amounts outstanding thereunder prior to maturity. These prepayment obligations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor further discussion of our debt arrangements with Bison, including recent modifications affecting our financial covenants with Bison, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Recent Developments-Amendment of our Subordinated Convertible Note Issued to Bison Capital.\u201d\nWe may require additional capital and credit in the future that may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nWe have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes, which has allowed us to continue to execute our business plan. Most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities, either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements.\nOur ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds. The actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the amount, timing and profitability of future revenues, working capital requirements, the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts, among other things.\nIf our sources of available liquidity are insufficient for the Company to fund its obligations and continue to operate, we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings in the future, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain adequate capital or credit could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results and we may be required to scale back operations or cease operations altogether.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe future trading market for our common stock may not be active on a consistent basis and the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.\nTrading in our common stock has been limited and, at times, volatile since our shares were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market in February 2008. The trading volume of our common stock in the future depends in part on our ability to increase our revenue and reduce or eliminate our operating losses. If we are unable to achieve these goals, the trading market for our common stock may be negatively affected, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of our common stock may also fluctuate as a result of:\n\u00b7 variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements by us, our competitors or others of significant business developments, changes in client relationships, acquisitions or expansion plans;\n\u00b7 analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, ratings and research reports;\n\u00b7 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press;\n\u00b7 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as sales promotions or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 actions by institutional and other stockholders;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u00b7 domestic and international economic factors and trends, some of which may be unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets, in general, periodically experience volatility that is sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the past, following a period of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company. Because of the potential volatility of our common stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. If we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could become subject to securities litigation.\nOur business is somewhat seasonal and can be affected by cyclical factors outside of our control. Our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter in the future. You should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, these fluctuations in our revenue may result in volatility in our results of operations and/or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. If the price of our common stock falls significantly we may be the target of securities litigation. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, and our reputation could be damaged, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. As a result of our restatement of prior financial statements, which we completed in July 2013, substantially all of the analysts that were following us ceased covering our Company and did not publish reports on us. If we do not receive adequate coverage by reputable securities analysts, we could fail to achieve visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our stock to stagnate or decline. If one or more analysts do pick up coverage on us, but subsequently downgrades their estimates or evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nDue to the concentration of holdings of our stock, a limited number of investors may be able to control matters requiring common stockholder approval or could cause our stock price to decline through future sales because they beneficially own a large percentage of our common stock.\nAs of March 30, 2016, there were 9,612,062 shares of our common stock outstanding and 10,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock convertible into an additional 4,166,666 shares of common stock that\nvote on an as converted basis, of which three investors own 74.3%. As a result of their significant ownership, these investors may have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over our business and corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors, a sale of substantially all of our assets, a merger between us and another entity or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation. This concentration of ownership could delay, defer or prevent a change of control and could adversely affect the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Also, in the event of a sale of our business, these investors could be able to seek to receive a control premium to the exclusion of other common stockholders.\nA significant percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the shares beneficially owned by these holders, can be sold in the public market from time to time, subject to limitations imposed by federal securities laws. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our presently outstanding shares of common stock by these investors or other stockholders in the public market or due to the perception that these sales could occur. This could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our equity securities or for you to sell your shares if you choose to do so.\nThe large concentration of our shares held by these three stockholders could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market.\nRaising additional capital or consummation of additional acquisitions through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities could dilute your ownership interest.\nIt is possible that we may find it necessary to raise capital again sometime in the future or to consummate additional acquisitions through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities. In the event we propose to issue new securities (subject to certain exceptions), we must allow Bison to purchase a proportion of the new securities equal to the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by Bison divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Our common stockholders do not have a corresponding right. If we raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, our existing common stockholders will likely experience dilution of their present equity ownership position and voting rights. Depending on the number of shares issued and the terms and conditions of the issuance, new equity securities could have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Depending on the terms, common stockholders may not have approval rights with respect to such issuances.\nProvisions of our charter and by-laws, in particular our \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent or discourage an acquisition of our Company that would benefit our stockholders.\nProvisions of our charter and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company, even when a change-in-control would benefit our stockholders. In particular, shares of our preferred stock may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval, upon terms and conditions, and with rights, privileges and preferences, as our Board of Directors may determine. In the past, we have issued preferred stock with dividend and liquidation preferences over our common stock, and with certain approval rights not accorded to our common stock, and which was convertible into shares of our common stock at a price lower than the market price of our common stock. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock we may issue in the future. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in pursuing possible additional equity financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. This could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and discourage these investors from acquiring a majority of our common stock. In addition, the price that future investors may\nbe willing to pay for our common stock may be lower due to the conversion price and exercise price granted to investors in any such private financing.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions, including the application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts our ability to engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of our capital stock. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nIssuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of certain convertible securities could dilute current stockholders.\nWe have issued 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d), which are presently convertible into 4,166,666 shares of common stock. We have also issued convertible notes in an aggregate amount of $11.75 million, which are convertible into shares of common stock upon the occurrence of certain events and/or the passage of time. Our existing common stockholders will likely experience dilution of their present equity ownership position and voting rights upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock or such convertible notes.\nThe terms of our Series C Preferred Stock include a liquidation preference as well as significant control rights.\nThe holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a liquidation preference equal to $10 million plus any unpaid dividends that have accrued to the Series C Preferred Stock upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company or upon any change of control event. Accordingly, the holders of our common stock may receive significantly less than their pro rata share of the proceeds in the event we are acquired.\nIn addition, the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock must provide their consent before we may take certain actions, including incurring certain amounts of indebtedness, entering into transactions with related persons, entering into new lines of business, modifying the provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock, and issuing any securities that are pari passu or senior to the Series C Preferred Stock. As a result of the foregoing, the requisite holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may be able to block the proposed approval of any of the above actions, which blockage may prevent us from achieving strategic or other goals dependent on such actions including, without limitation, additional capital raising or pursuing opportunities in new market segments.\nAll of the foregoing rights may limit our ability to take certain actions we deem to be in the interest of all of our stockholders but as to which the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock have control rights.\nA forced redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock may reduce cash available to fund our operations.\nAt any time after December 31, 2018, a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has the right to require us to redeem all or a portion of its Series C Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the original issue price of the Series C Preferred Stock plus all unpaid dividends accrued thereon. Any such redemption may significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund operations and invest in our business.\nBison may require a sale of the Company if our common stock is not sufficiently liquid.\nIf, on the fifth anniversary of the date we issued the Series C Preferred Stock or any succeeding anniversary of such date, ten percent (10%) of the average daily trading volume of our common stock is less than the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by Bison divided by 240, then Bison may require the Company to initiate a sale process. The holders of a majority of our capital stock have\nagreed to vote in favor of and otherwise support such a sale. If such a sale is not consummated within nine (9) months, Bison has the right to require the Company to purchase all or any portion of its Series C Preferred Stock or the common stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock has converted.\nAny such sale of the Company may not be in the interests of all of our stockholders. Additionally, if such sale is not consummated and Bison requires the Company to purchase its Series C Preferred Stock (or the common stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock has converted), this may significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund operations and invest in our business.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had reserved approximately 1,267,036 shares of common stock for issuance under outstanding options and approximately 4,166,666 shares issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act, and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, have imposed substantial requirements on public companies, including with respect to public disclosure, internal control, corporate governance practices and other matters. Our management and other personnel are devoting substantial amounts of time and resources to comply with these evolving laws, regulations and standards. Moreover, these laws, regulations and standards have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, we could incur significant costs to remediate any material weaknesses we identify through these efforts. We currently are evaluating and monitoring development with respect to these evolving laws, regulations and standards, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new regulatory requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities, which could harm our business prospects and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88850, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "LIME"}
