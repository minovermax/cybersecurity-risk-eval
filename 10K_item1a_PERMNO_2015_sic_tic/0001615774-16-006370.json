RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Only those investors who can bear the risk of loss of their entire investment should invest in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nBecause our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations, in which case you could lose your investment.\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their report on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Our historical operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not achieve profitability and do not have other sources of financing for our business, we may have to curtail or cease our business plans and operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment. We had no revenues for the year ended March 31, 2016, and our operating expenses were $3,979,000 and we incurred a net loss of $3,746,944. Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2016 was $13,846,171 and we have had recurring losses from operations. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time we can generate significant revenues, and/or reduce operating costs.\nWe have not yet established revenues sufficient to cover our current level of operating costs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to meet our total liabilities of $4,987,584 as of March 31, 2016, and to continue as a going concern, is dependent on us obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. We can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet our needs, or that any such financing will be obtained on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail our commercial activities. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $36,898 and accumulated deficit of $13,846,171 in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs a result of our going concern qualification, there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future. There can be no assurance that sufficient equity and/or debt financing will be available at all or, if available, that such financing will be at terms and conditions acceptable to us. Should we fail to obtain additional debt financing or raise additional capital, we may not be able to achieve our longer term business objectives and may face other serious adverse consequences. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, investors may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and the newly-issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility and may require us to provide collateral to secure the loan. In addition, in a liquidation, debtholders will be entitled to repayment before any proceeds can be paid to our equityholders.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur results may be affected by the outcome of current and any future litigation. Unfavorable rulings in such legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings. For example, an unfavorable ruling against us in the current case with respect to the Petition filed by Mr. Bengough, or a determination by the judge presiding over the Petition to force OCL into bankruptcy proceedings, would have a material adverse impact on our financial results, business and operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a detailed discussion of the Petition.\nIn addition, from time to time in the future we may be subject to various claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil or criminal) or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties, as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor. If the results of these investigations, proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third-party lawsuits, we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are heavily dependent on certain key personnel, namely Mr. Ellin, our Executive Chairman, President and controlling stockholder, who has extensive knowledge with respect to our business and thus, the loss of Mr. Ellin may adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the expertise of our key officer and director, Mr. Ellin, who has extensive knowledge about our business and our operations, and the loss of Mr. Ellin would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We do not maintain key-person insurance policy for Mr. Ellin. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees in the entertainment, medial and live events industries. In addition, as we continue to develop the business of LXL, it will need to hire additional personnel. Competition for personnel with the required knowledge, skill and experiences is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel. We currently do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Ellin as described herein (see Item 11. Executive Compensation - Employment Agreements). The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel, or assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition in the live music industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists, and, in the markets in which we promote music concerts; we face competition from other promoters and venue operators. Our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOther variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, leading to decreases in overall revenue, the number of sponsors, event attendance, ticket prices and fees or profit margins include:\n\u00b7 unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u00b7 competitors\u2019 offerings that may include more favorable terms than we offer in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate;\n\u00b7 technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer, which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events;\n\u00b7 other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u00b7 unfavorable changes in labor conditions which may require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees; and\n\u00b7 unfavorable shifts in population and other demographics which may cause us to lose audiences as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence, or which may cause sponsors to be unwilling to pay for sponsorship and advertising opportunities if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective.\nThe occurrence of any of such variables leading to an adverse effect on our financial performance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nWe incurred a net loss in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and may experience future net losses.\nWe incurred a net loss of approximately $3,600,000 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and had negative cash flows from operations for the same period. As of March 31, 2016, we had accumulated deficit of $13,846,171. We may face reduced demand for our live music events, our streaming platform and related services and other factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. We also expect to incur substantial development, marketing and general and administrative expenses related to our operations LXL and, to date, we have devoted most of our financial resources to development, marketing and general business activities of LXL. We expect to incur losses from LXL\u2019s operations for the foreseeable future and these losses could increase as we continue our business activities, as well as continue to attempt to increase marketing and engagement of LXL. If we are unable to generate profits and increased cash flow, including from LXL\u2019s ongoing operations, we may not become profitable in the future periods. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain such profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on entertainment and leisure events and factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. In addition, during past economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures. The impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue. The risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment and leisure events.\nOur business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. Many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results. Business conditions, as well as various industry conditions, including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels, can also significantly impact our operating results. These factors can affect attendance at our events, premium seat sales, sponsorship, advertising and hospitality spending, concession and merchandise sales, as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues, events and the industry. Negative factors such as challenging economic conditions, public concerns over terrorism and security incidents, particularly when combined, can impact corporate and consumer spending, and one negative factor can impact our results more than another. There can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions, or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.\nWe own 50% of KOKO.\nWe own 50% of the shares of capital stock of OCHL. OCHL is the sole owner of OCL which owns and operates KOKO. As 50% owner of OCHL, we have the right to appoint half of the members of the board of directors of OCHL and, as a result of the OCHL Shareholders Agreement, as amended, of OCL as well. Following the Merger, the Board of Directors of OCHL is comprised of Messrs. Ellin and Bengough and both manage OCHL pursuant to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and the Variation Agreement. Pursuant to the OCHL Shareholder Agreement discussed above under the heading \u201cMaterial Contracts Impacting Our Business - The OCHL Shareholder Agreement,\u201d and the Variation Agreement, discussed above under the heading \u201cMaterial Contracts Impacting Our Business - Variation to Shareholder\u2019s Agreement,\u201d we are subject to shared control of OCHL and thus of KOKO with regard to the management of KOKO so long as the OCHL Shareholder Agreement and the Variation Agreement are in effect and we control 50% or less of the shares of capital stock of OCHL. In the absence of holding a majority of voting rights, neither we nor the other owner of 50% of OCHL, Mr. Bengough, can unilaterally implement decisions pertaining to the operation or disposition of KOKO.\nWe continue to co-operate OCHL with Mr. Bengough and will seek expansion through other means such as acquisition of other live concert or event or media companies, licensing opportunities and hiring skilled personnel in the concert venue, media and night-club operations industries. We may not be able to fully leverage its strategies or to direct the expansion of the KOKO brand or enter into licensing or promotional arrangements, or to exploit the KOKO venue, without the consent of Mr. Bengough.\nOur directors and officers do not hold the majority of voting rights to control or to submit to stockholders for approval matters related to the operations of OCHL, OCL or KOKO.\nPursuant to the OCHL Shareholder Agreement and the Variation Agreement, we are restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL without the written consent of Mr. Bengough, and Mr. Bengough\u2019s consent is required for most material actions to be taken by OCHL and OCL, so long as the OCHL Shareholder\u2019s Agreement and the Variation Agreement remain in effect. This severely limits the power of our shareholders to vote to take actions with respect to KOKO\u2019s business. Therefore, our management needs to make decisions relating to the operations of KOKO in consultation with Mr. Bengough and subject to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders Agreement and the Variation Agreement.\nOur business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to maintain our attractiveness and reputation.\nOur business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on our ability to maintain the attractiveness of our venue and reputation as a place where shows can be successfully promoted and performed.\nOur business depends on relationships between key promoters, executives, agents, managers, artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships, as executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists, agents, promoters and managers in order to secure the rights to live music performances and events which are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business, the loss of any of OCL\u2019s or our officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business. We can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts, including musical artists.\nSimilarly, OCL depends upon the Mint Group Holdings Limited (\u201cMint Group\u201d) for management services including oversight of operational, financial and marketing activities. OCL\u2019s contract with the Mint Group is of 1-year duration. It is generally renewed each year but there is no assurance that at the end of any given one-year term, it will be renewed. If it were not renewed, OCL would have to hire employees or enter a contract with a different service provider. As of May 20, 2016, Mint Group terminated such management services agreement with OCL. The termination of the agreement occurred in connection with the filing of the Petition by Mr. Bengough after numerous attempts and extensive efforts by us to amicably resolve the disputes between the parties. As more fully discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below, in connection with the proceedings underlying the Petition, Mint Group agreed to resume providing services to OCL pending the resolution of the Petition or earlier stoppage of such services. There is no assurance that Mint Group will continue to provide any services to OCL or that OCL would be able to successfully find another service provider or within a time period that would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnother important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing relationships and to build new relationships with third-party distribution channels, advertisers, sponsors and service providers. Any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities. In the event of future acquisitions, we could, among other things:\n\u00b7 use a significant portion of our available cash;\n\u00b7 issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7 incur substantial debt;\n\u00b7 incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;\n\u00b7 incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and\n\u00b7 incur large accounting write-offs.\nSuch actions by us could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOCL currently operates in the London market, but we plan to expand internationally which may expose us to risks not found doing business in the United Kingdom.\nOCL currently provides services in the United Kingdom but we expect to expand our presence internationally. We expect to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations, including:\n\u00b7 political instability, adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic conditions in our current market and in new markets into which we may expand;\n\u00b7 more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the music and live entertainment industries, which could result in increased compliance costs and/or otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services;\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings;\n\u00b7 adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7 any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties;\n\u00b7 operating in foreign countries subjects us to risk from currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u00b7 diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 lower levels of internet usage, credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the United Kingdom; and\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with (i) business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by U.S. or British law and our internal policies and procedures, and (ii) management and operational systems and infrastructures, including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions, staffing and managing of foreign operations, which we might not be able to do effectively, or if so, on a cost-efficient basis.\nSince Mr. Bengough has failed to close on the exchange agreement to transfer his shares of OCHL to KoKo UK, we will need to seek expansion through other means such as acquisition of other live concert or event or media companies, seeking out licensing opportunities and hiring skilled personnel in the concert venue, media and night-club operations industries.\nIf the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term, significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period.\nOCL and/or LXL may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nOCL and/or LXL may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties. We regard our and OCL/LXL\u2019s intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property (as applicable) as critical to our success.\nOCL and LXL rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, domain names, or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.\nOCL and LXL have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used. OCL and LXL consider the protection of their trademarks and service marks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While OCL and LXL vigorously protect their trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which OCL and LXL may operate, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. As we expand internationally, we may become aware of third parties in other jurisdictions that already own prior rights to the KOKO and LiveXLive trademarks. Depending on the circumstances, we may deem it appropriate, for instance, to acquire a license or a consent from any such prior mark owners, or we may determine to operate under a different mark in that jurisdiction. Also, OCL and LXL have generally also registered and continue to reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate. Not every variation of a domain name may be available, however, or OCL or LXL may determine not to register it, even if available. Our or OCL\u2019s or LXL\u2019s failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations.\nBecause we own, through OCL, assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations, we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.\nThere is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with OCL\u2019s live music events, which could subject us or OCL to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at OCL\u2019s live music events, causing a decrease in our revenue.\nThere are inherent risks involved with producing live music events. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. Incidents in connection with OCL\u2019s live music events at any of our venues could also result in claims, reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue. While we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management\u2019s judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at OCL\u2019s venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nActivities or conduct, such as illegal drug use, at OCL\u2019s properties or the events OCL produces may expose OCL to liability, cause OCL to lose business licenses or government approvals, result in the cancellation of all or a part of an event or result in adverse publicity.\nOCL is subject to risks associated with activities or conduct, such as drug use at our events or venue that are illegal or violate the terms of our OCL\u2019s business licenses. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our events or venue may result in negative publicity, adverse consequences (including illness, injury or death) to the persons engaged in the illegal activity or others, and litigation against us. OCL has developed policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that the operation of each event is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. Additionally, OCL has a \u2018\u2018no tolerance\u2019\u2019 policy on illegal drug use in or around its facilities, and OCL continually monitors the actions of entertainers, fans and our employees to ensure that proper behavioral standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, cannot provide absolute assurance that the policies\u2019 objectives are achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. The consequences of these acts may increase our costs, result in the loss or termination of the lease for OCL\u2019s venue by the property owner, result in our inability to get the necessary permits and locations for our events, or lead to the cancellation of all or part of an event. These consequences may also make it more difficult for OCL to obtain or retain sponsorships, lower consumer demand for OCL\u2019s events, subject OCL to liability claims, divert management\u2019s attention from OCL\u2019s business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors. These outcomes could have the effect of lowering our revenue, profitability and/or our stock price.\nCosts associated with, and our ability to obtain, adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nHeightened concerns and challenges regarding property, casualty, liability, business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weather-related conditions and incidents. As a result, OCL may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable rates, including coverage for acts of terrorism and weather-related property damage. OCL has a material investment in property and equipment at its existing venue and may have material investments at future venues, which are located in or near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans.\nThese operational, geographical and situational factors, among others, may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable. OCL cannot assure that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact its profitability, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.\nWe cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits, including insurance coverage for property, casualty, liability and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism, would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues, or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages. We cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available, offered at reasonable rates, or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness. The occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting our existing venue or any one or more of our future venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and/or company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages.\nCosts associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nGrowth or maintenance of OCL\u2019s existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in its venue. Therefore, OCL expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet long-term increasing demand, value and revenue. OCL frequently may have a number of significant capital projects underway. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond OCL\u2019s control, may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements, including:\n\u00b7 availability of financing on favorable terms;\n\u00b7 advances in technology and related changes in customer expectations;\n\u00b7 unforeseen changes in design;\n\u00b7 increases in the cost of materials, equipment and labor;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u00b7 litigation, accidents or natural disasters;\n\u00b7 national or regional economic changes; and\n\u00b7 additional venue acquisition costs.\nThe amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year. In addition, actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials, equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change. Construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which, if changed, could materially affect the ultimate cost.\nOCL is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOCL\u2019s operations are subject to national statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, both domestically and internationally, which are subject to change at any time, governing matters such as:\n\u00b7 construction, renovation and operation of our venues;\n\u00b7 licensing and planning laws, including those relating to noise, security and playing copyrighted music and sound recordings;\n\u00b7 human health, safety and sanitation requirements;\n\u00b7 the service of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u00b7 working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, immigration and employment laws;\n\u00b7 compliance with the DDA, DDR and regarding any operations in the US, the ADA;\n\u00b7 listed building regulation;\n\u00b7 compliance with United States FCPA, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries;\n\u00b7 advertising regulation;\n\u00b7 hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws;\n\u00b7 sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;\n\u00b7 privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;\n\u00b7 marketing activities via post, telephone, text and online; and\n\u00b7 the timely filing of corporate documentation with the Company Registrar (including in relation to financial accounts).\nOCL\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While OCL attempts to conduct its business and operations in a manner that it believes to be in compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to OCL\u2019s current understanding of the law or regulation. In addition, the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nOur primary strategy for the growth of LXL is dependent upon our ability to acquire and develop live music festival streaming rights, and any inability to fund the significant up-front cash requirements associated with our live music streaming platform could result in the inability to secure and retain such festival rights.\nIn order to secure live music festival streaming rights, we are often required to advance cash to the festival promoter prior to the sale of any advertising or sponsorships or for that festival. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or available capacity to advance the necessary cash for any given festival, we would not be able to retain the rights for that festival and our live music streaming business would be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop and grow LXL\u2019s user base, or if ad engagement on our platform declines, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nThe size of LXL\u2019s user base is critical to our success. LXL will need to develop and cultivate a strong user base. We expect to generate revenue based upon subscription fees from our users and ads that we display. If people do not perceive our products and services to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract users to subscribe to our services and/or increase the frequency of their engagement with our platform and the ads that we display. A number of consumer-oriented websites that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our user base. A number of factors could potentially negatively affect user growth and engagement, including if:\n\u00b7 users engage with other products, services or activities as an alternative to ours;\n\u00b7 influential users, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands or certain age demographics conclude that an alternative product or service is more relevant;\n\u00b7 we are unable to convince potential new users of the value and usefulness of our products and services;\n\u00b7 there is a decrease in the perceived quality of our content;\n\u00b7 we fail to introduce new and improved products or services or if we introduce new or improved products or services that are not favorably received or that negatively affect user engagement;\n\u00b7 technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products or services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, including issues with connecting to the Internet;\n\u00b7 users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products or services on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n\u00b7 users believe that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, relevance and prominence of ads that we display;\n\u00b7 there are user concerns related to privacy and communication, safety, security or other factors;\n\u00b7 there are adverse changes in our products or services that are mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;\n\u00b7 we fail to provide adequate customer service to users; or\n\u00b7 we do not maintain our brand image or our reputation is damaged.\nIf we are unable to develop and grow our user base, or if these metrics decline, our products and services could be less attractive to potential new users, as well as to advertisers and platform partners, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf LXL is unable to compete effectively for users and advertiser spend, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetition for users of LXL\u2019s products and services is intense. Although LXL is developing a new platform for streaming live music events in real time, LXL faces strong competition in its business. LXL will compete against many companies to attract and engage users, including, (i) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers such as Clear Channel and CBS and satellite radio providers such as Sirius XM, (ii) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as Apple\u2019s iTunes Music Store and Apple Music, RDIO, Rhapsody, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Amazon that allow listeners to stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase and (iii) other forms of entertainment, including Facebook (including Instagram), Google, Twitter (including Periscope), Yahoo, and Meerkat which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. To the extent users choose to watch satellite or cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Hulu, VEVO or YouTube or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than use the LXL service, these content services pose a competitive threat. We believe that LXL\u2019s ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 the timing and market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u00b7 the adoption of our products and services domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7 our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services;\n\u00b7 the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain relationships with platform partners that integrate with our platform;\n\u00b7 changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees, particularly engineers, designers and product managers;\n\u00b7 acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and\n\u00b7 our reputation and the brand strength relative to our competitors.\nLXL also will face significant competition for advertiser spend. We expect the substantial majority of LXL\u2019s advertising revenue will be generated through festival sponsorships and ads on the LXL mobile app and website, and LXL competes against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and print, for advertising budgets. LXL also will compete with advertising networks, exchanges, demand side platforms and other platforms, such as Google AdSense, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, Yahoo Ad Exchange, AOL\u2019s Ad.com and Microsoft Media Network, for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. In order to grow LXL\u2019s revenue and improve LXL\u2019s operating results, LXL must increase its share of spending on advertising relative to its competitors, many of which are larger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of LXL\u2019s larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain additional share of advertising budgets.\nIf LXL is not able to compete effectively for users and advertisers spend our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nLXL\u2019s products and services may contain undetected software errors, which could harm our business and operating results.\nLXL\u2019s products and services incorporate complex software and we encourage employees to quickly develop and help us launch new and innovative features. Our software, including any open source software that is incorporated into our code, may contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Any errors, bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of platform partners, loss of advertisers or advertising revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nLXL\u2019s products and services contain open source software, and LXL licenses some of its software through open source projects, which may pose particular risks to LXL proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative effect on our business.\nLXL uses open source software in its products and services and will use open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which LXL is subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on LXL\u2019s ability to provide or distribute its products or services. Additionally, LXL may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that LXL developed using such software, which could include LXL proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require LXL to make its software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until LXL can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and LXL may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe will require substantial amounts of capital to develop, launch and operate LXL, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nWe will require substantial amounts of capital to develop, launch and operate LXL. Our ability to obtain financing, if and when required, will depend on investor and lender demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors, and we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns, and there can be no assurance that such advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits.\nSuch marketing activities include, among others, promotion of events and ticket sales, premium seat sales, hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel. There can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits.\nWe are vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth.\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we expect to achieve organically and through acquisitions and the demands and additional responsibilities that our growth will place on our management.\nThe following factors could present us with difficulties in managing our growth:\n\u00b7 a lack of sufficient executive-level personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability to successfully develop, expand and monetize our digital music, video and other content offerings;\n\u00b7 an increased administrative burden on our employees;\n\u00b7 the inability to attract, train, manage and retain the qualified personnel necessary to manage and operate a greater number of venues, events and other business activities; and\n\u00b7 the inability to integrate acquired businesses.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges associated with our anticipated growth, our growth itself may fail to materialize, we may grow without achieving profitability, we may have difficulty with our internal controls and procedures and the quality of our events and other offerings may decline, among other things. Any of these could harm our business and financial results.\nOCL and/or LXL may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks.\nThe occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents, natural disasters or similar events, may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events, which may decrease OCL\u2019s and/or LXL\u2019s revenue or expose them to substantial liability. The terrorism and security incidents in the past, military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities.\nFollowing past terrorism actions, some artists refused to travel or book tours, which adversely affected our business. The occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, military actions by the United States or others, contagious disease outbreaks, natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries where we may do business in the future.\nTo service OCL\u2019s lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures, OCL will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOCL\u2019s ability to service its lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control. This is, to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that OCL\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to OCL in an amount sufficient to enable OCL to pay its lease obligations or to fund its other liquidity needs. If OCL\u2019s future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay its obligations as they occur or to fund its liquidity needs, it may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets or obtain additional equity capital.\nThese measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting OCL to meet scheduled lease obligations. It may be unable to restructure or refinance its obligations and obtain debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. Capital markets have been volatile in the recent past; a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise. As a result, the inability to meet OCL\u2019s lease obligations could cause it to default on those obligations. Any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nYou could lose all of your investment.\nAn investment in our shares of our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in our Company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in our Company will fully reflect its underlying value. You could lose your entire investment.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to the seasonality of our business and other factors related to our business;\n\u00b7 our loss of or inability to obtain significant popular artists;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7 the publication by securities analysts of financial estimates or reports about our business;\n\u00b7 changes by securities analysts of earnings estimates or reports, or our inability to meet those estimates or achieve any goals described in those reports;\n\u00b7 the disclosure of facts about our business that may differ from those assumed by securities analysts in preparing their estimates or reports about us;\n\u00b7 media reports, whether accurate or inaccurate;\n\u00b7\t receptivity of the capital markets to our efforts to expand into the live music festival streaming business;\n\u00b7 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7 overall market fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the conversion or exercise of currently outstanding convertible securities or the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,800,000 warrants to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, which are exercisable at $0.01, outstanding with the warrants issued to Trinad Management subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.\nIn addition, we may issue in the future our authorized but previously unissued common stock or other equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of our shares offered hereby. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 75,000,000 shares of our common stock and 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes.\nThe conversion of such notes, the exercise of such warrants and/or future issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to meet our working capital needs and/or debt obligations, and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for your stock or below the conversion price of such debenture or the exercise prices of such warrants.\nIn addition, we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy. These acquisitions may involve the payment of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities. Any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time. In addition, future financing transactions through the sale of additional shares of our common stock at or below market prices may adversely affect our stock prices. The price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock.\nMr. Ellin, our Executive Chairman, President and controlling stockholder, and his affiliated entities own a substantial amount of our capital stock, and he may make decisions that you do not consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAs of June 30, 2016, Mr. Ellin, our and Executive Chairman and President, beneficially owns approximately 42.4%% of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Ellin would have the ability to significantly impact the election of our Board of Directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of our Company.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of our Company. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of our Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to our Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent managers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nThere is currently a very limited public market for shares of our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active public market will ever develop. Failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.\nThere is currently a very limited public market for shares of our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active market will never develop. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol \u201cLIVX.\u201d Each of the OTC Markets (of which OTC Pink is a part of) is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. We may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which is often a more widely-traded and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders\u2019 equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains quoted on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur stock may be traded infrequently and in low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares.\nUntil our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the OTC Pink. In those venues, however, the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our shares of common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, which could affect its market price.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth, development and expansion of our business and/or to repay existing indebtedness. Accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The declaration, payment and amount of future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of Nevada law. Accordingly, holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, we are required to:\n\u00b7 maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7 maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7 prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u00b7 institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u00b7 involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on an audit committee which we expect to establish.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm will have to attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. Based upon the last evaluation conducted as of March 31, 2016, our management at the time concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. While our management believes that our control environment is substantially improved, we continue at the present time not to have an audit committee, sufficient separation of accounting personnel or sufficient personnel to make disclosure controls and procedures effective.\nWhile we intend to diligently and thoroughly document, review, test and improve our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404, management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and (if required in future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group or an audit committee, and we will need to retain the services of additional accounting and financial staff or consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404. We intend to review the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and make any changes management determines appropriate, including to achieve compliance with Section 404 by the date on which we are required to so comply.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nThere have been changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, regulations promulgated by the SEC and rules promulgated by the OTC Markets and the national securities exchanges. These new or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we could be subject to liability under applicable laws or our reputation may be harmed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n***\nThe risks above do not necessarily comprise of all those associated with an investment in our Company. This Annual Report contains forward looking statements that involve unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those set out above.", "PERMNO": 17323, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LIVX"}
