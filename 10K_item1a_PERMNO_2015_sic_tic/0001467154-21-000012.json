{"cik": "1467154", "company": "Novan, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to, those described below, each of which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report. The realization of any of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation, business, including our financial condition, results of operations and growth, which we refer to collectively in this section as our business, and ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Current Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We will need significant additional funding to continue our business operations and for the advancement of our product development programs. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs, or our commercialization efforts.\nWe are a clinical development-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history. Investment in biotechnology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, obtain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a drug on a commercial scale, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing drugs. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not and have never been profitable and have incurred losses in each period since inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, we reported a net loss of $29.3 million and $30.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $249.3 million, and $220.0 million, respectively, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues, if any. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nRaising additional capital, including through the issuance of shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital pursuant to the July 2020 Aspire CSPA, may cause significant dilution to our existing stockholders, reduce the trading price of our common stock, require us to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of shares authorized under our certificate of incorporation and/or authorize us to issue additional shares of common stock (which approval(s) may not be obtained), restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, our ability to continue to operate our business, including our ability to advance our development programs, is dependent upon our ability to access additional capital through non-dilutive sources, including partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships, and/or through the issuance of debt or equity securities (including any common stock issued to Aspire Capital pursuant to the July 2020 Aspire CSPA).\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had 145,700,091 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had reserved 16,903,031 shares of common stock for future issuance related to (i) outstanding warrants to purchase common stock, (ii) outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights, and (iii) future issuance under the 2016 Plan (as defined below). As of December 31, 2019, we had 26,734,800 shares of our common stock outstanding, with an additional 13,177,766 reserved for future issuance. Our common stock consists of 200,000,000 authorized shares as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Under our certificate of incorporation, increasing the number of shares authorized under our certificate of incorporation would require the approval of our stockholders, and there can be no assurance that our stockholders would provide such approval, as additional issuances pursuant to such authorization would result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. Without such approval, or without implementing a reverse stock split that would reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common\nstock and thereby increase the shares available for issuance, we may not have the ability to raise additional capital as needed to support development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have outstanding and exercisable warrants and options that if exercised may result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders and may reduce the trading price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we have warrants to purchase approximately 13.8 million shares of common stock outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.48 per share. In addition, we had outstanding and exercisable options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020 with a weighted average exercise price of $3.26 per share.\nAny issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants requiring that we place liens on some or all of our assets or limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, effecting a change in control or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have entered into and rely on, and may enter into and rely on other, strategic relationships for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates, and if we are unable to enter into such relationships on favorable terms or at all, or if such relationships are unsuccessful, if disputes arise between us and our strategic partners or if we fail to trigger contingent payments under such strategic relationships, we may be unable to realize the potential economic benefit of those product candidates.\nWe have entered into and rely on, and may enter into and rely on other, strategic relationships for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, in 2019 we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek and the Funding Agreement with Ligand, and we are currently exploring and intend to advance certain clinical-stage dermatological product candidates through partnerships, collaborations or other strategic relationships. We intend to continue to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to develop and commercialize our product candidates, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish such collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, or that our current or future collaborative arrangements will be successful. If we are unable to reach successful agreements with suitable collaborators for our product candidates, we would face significant incremental costs, we may be required to limit the scope and number of our product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them or we might fail to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found. Our current and future collaboration partners may not dedicate sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their development and commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, we may incur additional product development and commercialization expenses and our operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we breach or fail to comply with any provision of a collaboration agreement, a collaborator may have the right to terminate, in whole or in part, such agreement or to seek damages. Some of our collaboration agreements are complex and involve sharing of certain data, know-how and intellectual property rights amongst the parties. Additionally, these potential collaborators may not accept the transfer of critical methods and processes in order for development and commercialization work for our product candidates to take place. Our collaborators could interpret certain provisions differently than we do, which could lead to unexpected or inadvertent disputes with our collaborators. Any one of our collaborators could breach obligations, covenants or restrictions in our agreements, leading us into disputes and potential breaches of our agreements with other collaborators, which could have direct or indirect financial implications. If a strategic relationship terminates or is otherwise unsuccessful, we may need to identify and establish an alternative arrangement. This may not be possible, or we may not be able to do so on terms which are acceptable to us, in which case, it may be necessary for us to cease the development of the applicable product candidate or candidates, or conduct the remaining clinical development or commercialization on our own and with our own funds.\nOur process of considering financial and strategic alternatives could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have announced that we are in the process of considering financial and strategic alternatives to deliver value to our stockholders. Such alternatives might include, among other things, out-licensing some or all of our product candidates, the sale of some or all of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, or a sale of our company, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us. We may pursue such alternatives at the same time as we seek to secure additional funding. This process could disrupt and create uncertainty concerning our business, regardless of whether we are able to obtain additional funding or complete any strategic alternatives, and poses other risks to our business, including:\n\u2022potential uncertainty in the marketplace concerning our ongoing viability as a business\u037e\n\u2022the possibility of disruption to our business and operations, including diversion of significant management time and resources towards the pursuit of funding and strategic alternatives\u037e\n\u2022impairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel who are necessary to the operation of the business and the development of its product candidates\u037e\n\u2022restrictions on our business operations and ability to explore other strategic alternatives under any definitive agreement we may enter into as a result of this process; and\n\u2022potential future stockholder litigation relating to the strategic process that could prevent or delay the strategic process, and the related costs of such litigation.\nIf any of the foregoing risks were realized, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our business operations and clinical trials and could continue, directly or indirectly, to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our business operations and we continue to monitor applicable government recommendations. We have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing certain of our employees to work remotely and conducting our laboratory operations at reduced capacity. Notwithstanding these measures, the COVID-19 pandemic could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the third parties whom we expect have taken or will take similar measures. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from shelter-in-place policies and other restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs.\nThe extent and severity of the impact on our business and clinical trials will be determined largely by the extent of delays in the conduct and recruitment of current and future clinical trials and potentially higher rates of drop-out of subjects from ongoing studies, delays in site entry of study data into the data base, delays in monitoring of study data because of restricted physical access to study sites, delays in site responses to queries, delays in data-base lock, delays in data analyses, delays in time to top-line data, and delays in completing study reports. For example, as discussed below, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to have an impact on the execution of our B-SIMPLE4 study for SB206.\nIn addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of the FDA and other health authorities may delay potential approvals of our clinical trial protocols.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to estimate the entirety of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, operations and employees, our contract manufacturers, our clinical research contractors, and our collaborators in clinical research, any continued spread of COVID-19, measures taken by governments, actions taken to protect employees from this disease, and the broad impact of the pandemic on all business activities and financial markets, may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.\nThe way in which we utilize our late-stage clinical dermatology product candidates to secure needed operating capital may significantly impact our business strategy, future operations and financial position.\nWe may engage in one or more potential transactions that could result in the licensing, sale or divestiture of some or all of our clinical-stage dermatology product candidates and related proprietary technologies. In certain potential scenarios, the counterparty(ies) to such a transaction may assume responsibility for the planning, execution, or oversight of the clinical development and regulatory requirements for the associated product candidates and/or the ultimate commercialization of the product candidates. If we decide to engage in such a transaction and, as a result, no longer have significant involvement or responsibility for late-stage clinical development activities or commercialization, we would adjust our business strategy, operating plans, resources and capabilities accordingly. Alternatively, we may pursue a transaction in which the counter-party agrees to finance the continued development of one or more product candidates in exchange for future milestone or royalty payments. Absent any such transaction and resulting change in strategic direction, we anticipate continuing to progress our late-stage dermatology product candidates through our existing business model to the extent funding is available. We cannot provide any commitment as to the timing of any such transaction or change in strategy we may adopt. If we determine to change our business strategy or to seek to engage in a strategic transaction, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different from those in historical periods or projected by our management. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change in our existing business strategy.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness could continue to adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for a significant and unusual transaction related to the warrants we issued in connection with a public offering of common stock and accompanying warrants completed on January 9, 2018, or the January 2018 Offering. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our warrant liability, change in fair value of warrant liability, additional paid-in capital, accumulated deficit and related financial disclosures for certain periods in 2019 and 2018. Any failure to maintain such internal control could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to timely file will cause us to be ineligible to utilize short form registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-4, which may impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion to execute our business strategies or issue shares to effect an acquisition. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding going concern, and we will need additional financing to execute our business plan, to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception, we have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows and we expect to continue to generate operating losses and consume significant cash resources in the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern without additional financing. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included explanatory paragraphs in its report on our 2020 consolidated financial statements, with respect to this uncertainty. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nAlthough our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. We are required to meet specified requirements to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, including, among other things, a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On February 19, 2020, we received notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department, or the Staff, of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, notifying us that for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the minimum bid price of our common stock had not exceeded $1.00 per share, or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We were provided a period of 180 calendar days, which was tolled until November 2, 2020, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In response, we filed an application to transfer the listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of receiving approval of that application from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq, we were provided an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 3, 2021, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On January 29, 2021, we received written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that over the previous ten consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock had closed at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, Nasdaq confirmed that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance and thus could be subject to delisting from Nasdaq in the future.\nIf our common stock is delisted and there is no longer an active trading market for our shares, it may, among other things:\n\u2022cause you difficulty in selling your shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell your shares at all;\n\u2022substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or\n\u2022result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nA delisting would also reduce the value of our equity compensation plans, which could negatively impact our ability to retain key employees.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of our Current and Future Product Candidates\nWe specialize solely in developing nitric oxide-based therapeutics to treat a range of diseases with significant unmet needs, and if we do not successfully achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or successfully commercialize them, all of which is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and outcomes, we may not be able to continue as a business.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety profile or meet the efficacy endpoints despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Notwithstanding any potential promising results in earlier testing, we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical development is completed for any of our product candidates, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nOn January 2, 2020, we announced top-line results from the Phase 3 B-SIMPLE program with SB206 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Statistical significance was not achieved for the primary endpoint in either B-SIMPLE1 or B-SIMPLE2, however multiple sensitivity analyses, including post-hoc assessments, were consistent across both studies and we believe support a potential path forward for further development of the asset. After a Type C meeting with the FDA in April 2020, we have initiated our B-SIMPLE4 trial for SB206, however, we cannot assure you that B-SIMPLE4 or any additional clinical trials we may conduct for the SB206 Phase 3 program or any of our other product candidates will achieve results that are sufficient to support an NDA submission for the applicable product candidates or regulatory approval of the product. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing sufficient to advance development of one or more of our product candidates. In addition, our ongoing or future preclinical studies may not prove successful in demonstrating proof-of concept, or may show adverse toxicological findings, and even, if successful, may not necessarily predict that subsequent clinical trials will show the requisite safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Moreover, all of our clinical development efforts to date have focused on the development of nitric oxide-based topical therapies. There can be no assurance that the intended or anticipated results from the use of nitric oxide-based therapies will be reaped, and that we, or our existing or potential future commercial partners, will successfully bring our product candidates to market. Because all of our current product candidates are based on nitric oxide and our Nitricil technology, the failure of our Nitricil technology to be safe or efficacious generally will have adverse implications for our entire product candidate pipeline. If, for any reason, our intended use of nitric oxide does not materialize, we may not be able to redeploy our resources to alternative components or raw materials, efficiently or at all.\nDelay or termination of planned clinical trials for our product candidates, including as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, would result in unplanned expenses and significantly adversely impact our remaining developmental activities and potential commercial prospects with respect to, and ability to generate revenues from, such product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in completing ongoing trials and initiating planned trials and we cannot be certain whether these trials or any other future clinical trials for our product candidates will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to:\n\u2022the FDA disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites and prospective strategic partners, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs, trial sites and partners;\n\u2022obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022adverse events occurring in clinical studies of our product candidates;\n\u2022recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022clinical sites deviating from trial protocol;\n\u2022how we address patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022utilizing an adequate container and delivery device for the product candidate; or\n\u2022changes to our financial priorities or insufficient capital available to fund clinical trials.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for a variety of reasons.\nIf we encounter difficulties or delays enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities would be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends on, among other things, the ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022the proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u2022the design of the trial;\n\u2022our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022our ability to obtain patient consents; and\n\u2022the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the timing and execution of trial initiation of our B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial for SB206, and we are assessing any further impact of COVID-19 on the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial for SB206. We may face difficulties and/or delays related to the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial for SB206 or our other planned preclinical or clinical trials if (i) the prevalence of molluscum contagiosum is reduced as a result of the various measures implemented by authorities to try to contain COVID-19, (ii) the patient populations that are eligible for our planned clinical trials are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or (iii) if healthcare resources continue to be prioritized toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the greatest incidence of molluscum is in children aged one to 14 years, school and child care center closures or reliance on virtual learning could impact our ability to conduct the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial for SB206. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect the business of the FDA or other health authorities, which could result in delays in our interactions with the FDA related to our planned clinical trials.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may compete for the recruitment of patients with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us, to the extent patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors.\nIf we experience delays in enrollment for or the completion, or termination, of our ongoing and any future clinical trials for our product candidates, we may experience increased costs, have difficulty raising capital through non-dilutive or dilutive sources, and have to slow down our product candidate development and regulatory approval process timelines. Further, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates could be delayed or not realized at all. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial\ncondition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our preclinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, or are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe currently do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies that comply with the regulatory requirements known as good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements. We also do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials on our product candidates properly and on time. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our GLP preclinical studies and our GCP clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical studies and GCP clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. In addition, if any of our third parties terminate their involvement with us for any reason, we may not be able to enter into similar arrangements with alternative third parties within a short period of time or do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nMany of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. In addition, since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. If the third parties conducting our GLP preclinical studies or our GCP clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols, GLPs or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated. As a result, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIn addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA of any NDA we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our future product candidates.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue one or more product candidates or indications within our product development strategy, which has and may continue to change over time, and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of their potential both to gain regulatory approval and to achieve commercialization. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or in other indications with greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.\nOur product candidates may pose safety issues, cause adverse events, have side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nWe, any partner with whom we may collaborate in the future, or the FDA may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various reasons, including the discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or other safety issues experienced by trial participants. In addition, adverse events caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events or unexpected characteristics. To date, patients treated with our product candidates have experienced instances of drug-related cutaneous intolerability observations, including dryness, scaling, burning, erythema, itching, pain or irritation, and adverse events, including irritation and contact dermatitis.\nIf safety issues or unacceptable adverse events arise in the development of our product candidates, we, the FDA, the IRBs at the institutions in which our trials are conducted, or the DSMB could suspend or terminate our clinical trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Treatment-related adverse events could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these adverse events may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. Any of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and may result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable and have been and may be disrupted by the COVID 19 pandemic, and if we, or a potential future partner, are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis or at all, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future ourselves or with a potential future strategic partner will ever obtain regulatory approval. Neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. For example, there are multiple methodologies for handling missing data and other statistical considerations to take into account that the FDA may utilize when analyzing the robustness of any data set during NDA review. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including:\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022unfavorable or ambiguous results from our clinical trials;\n\u2022results that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n\u2022serious and unexpected drug-related adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indication;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s disagreement regarding the formulation, container, dosing delivery device, labeling or the specifications of our product candidates;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u2022the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA approval process and become commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of outcomes from future clinical trials may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nEven if we or a potential future partner, eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA or foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, or the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. The FDA also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020, and subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInterim, top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, top-line, or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a full analyses of all data related to the particular trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, top-line, or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between interim, top-line, or preliminary data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our business in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, product candidate or our business. If the interim, top-line, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.\nRegulatory approval of our product candidates by foreign regulatory authorities may be delayed or denied. We, or our current or potential future partners, may be subject to pricing controls imposed by foreign governments and regulatory authorities.\nWe, or any current or potential future partners, may seek regulatory approval of our product candidates from foreign regulatory authorities. Such regulatory authorities may impose additional regulations and guidelines that differ in form and substance from those imposed by their counterparts in the United States and with which we are more familiar. Accordingly, the regulatory approval of our product candidates in those foreign jurisdictions could be delayed, limited or denied altogether. This could limit the scope of or prevent the commercialization of our products in the future and adversely affect our financial performance. Further, in some countries, the pricing of pharmaceutical prescriptions is subject to governmental control, including, for example, Japan. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after coverage and reimbursement have been obtained. Reference pricing used by various countries and parallel distribution or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries can further reduce prices. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our current or potential future partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, which is time-consuming and costly. If coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed.\nWe may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any adverse events, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. We cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits in the future, nor can we assure you that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our liability under any such cases. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into\ncontact with our product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in circumstances that are materially adverse to our business, including:\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022decreased enrollment rates of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022product recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022substantial costs of any related litigation or similar disputes;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention and other resources from our primary business;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants against us that may not be covered by insurance; or\n\u2022loss of revenue.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage, with an aggregate limit of $10,000,000, for clinical trials. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse events. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. We will need to increase our product liability coverage if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, which will be costly, and we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash, negatively impact our statement of operations and harm our financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Potential Future Commercialization of Our Product Candidates, if such Product Candidates Complete Development and Receive Regulatory Approval\nOur product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical industry and the markets in which our approved product candidates, if any, would compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. In addition, certain of our product candidates, if approved, may compete with other products, including OTC treatments, for a share of some patients\u2019 discretionary budgets and for physicians\u2019 attention within their clinical practices. To compete successfully in the marketplace, our approved products, if any, will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of such products provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates.\nDue to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available for use in those international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we expect our product candidates will face more competition in these markets than in the United States.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates or any future product candidate that receives regulatory approval, either through a commercial partner or internally, we may not be successful in commercializing and generating potential revenues from those product candidates, if approved.\nWe do not currently have a sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure in place. To achieve commercial success for any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales, marketing and distribution framework internally or through a commercial partner or other form of strategic relationship for commercialization. In the future, we may build a focused sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to market any of our product candidates in the United States. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay market uptake. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, which could decrease our revenue and our profitability. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into such arrangements with third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may not have adequate control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. In addition, such third parties will be subject to the commercialization risks described above. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nAdditionally, we have entered into an exclusive license agreement in Japan with Sato relating to SB204 and SB206 for the treatment of acne vulgaris and viral skin infections, respectively, and we expect to continue to evaluate strategic partnerships to commercialize our dermatology products in select international markets. We may not be sufficiently familiar or have the requisite resources to penetrate international markets where some of our competitors have already achieved broad recognition and have established commercialization strategies in place. Moreover, we may not succeed in targeting healthcare providers, including physicians, who may not be familiar with our product candidates.\nEven if our current product candidates or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications. Our product candidates may not be commercially successful. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our product as compared to other available therapies;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors for any of our product candidates that may be approved;\n\u2022the cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of patients;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022physician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications;\n\u2022overcoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications;\n\u2022patient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product candidates and overall treatment experience;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay for certain of our product candidates relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u2022the revenue and profitability that our product candidates may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our product candidates;\n\u2022any FDA requirement to undertake a REMS;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u2022potential product liability claims.\nIf any of our current or future product candidates are approved for use but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption necessary for commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nIf we, or a potential future partner, receive regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, our relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors, as well as our general business operations, may be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and failure to comply with such regulations could expose us to penalties including criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, customers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we, or a potential future partner, may obtain marketing approval. Future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and customers and general operations may expose us, or a potential future partner, to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we, or a potential future partner, market, sell and distribute any product candidates for which we, or a potential future partner, obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n\u2022the federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the United States federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to certain payments or other \u2018\u2018transfers of value\u2019\u2019 made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to\nreport annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u2018\u2018transfers of value\u2019\u2019 to such physician owners; and\n\u2022analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or report marketing expenditures and pricing information.\nEfforts to ensure that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom will recommend, purchase or prescribe our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which would adversely impact our statement of operations and cash flows.\nOur product candidates may cause side effects which could delay or prevent their commercialization.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or other companies developing other nitric oxide-based therapies, later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022we may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u2022additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u2018\u2018black box\u2019\u2019 warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022we may be required to implement a REMS or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such adverse events for distribution to patients;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022the product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nWe expect to educate and train medical personnel so they know how to use our product candidates to understand their potential side effect profiles. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in patient injury.\nEven if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval, the products may become subject to unfavorable third-party coverage or reimbursement policies, which would harm our business.\nThe success of our product candidates, if approved, depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations. Patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs\nassociated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement that will be provided. Coverage decisions may depend on clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product in their formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement, or otherwise restrict patient access through formulary controls or otherwise to a branded product when a less costly generic equivalent or alternative is available. Coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.\nAssuming that we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement rates might not be adequate to cover our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution, or achieve or sustain profitability, or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for a product can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, obtaining and maintaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nGovernmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available, limited, or adequate in either the United States or international markets.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Manufacturing\nDelays or disruptions in the qualification of manufacturing facilities and processes or in the manufacture of our (i) APIs, including NVN1000 or any other Nitricil NCEs, or (ii) clinical trial materials or commercial supplies of any approved product candidates, whether by us or any third-party manufacturer with whom we contract, including any delays in the transfer of technology to such manufacturers, could adversely affect our development and commercialization timelines and result in increased costs of our development programs or in our breaching our obligations to others.\nWe have manufactured the NVN1000 API, one of our Nitricil NCEs, for all of our current clinical stage product candidates internally, and at this stage, we intend to pursue a dual strategy of identifying and designating a partner to become the primary third-party external supplier of our proprietary berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) drug substance to support short-term and long-term manufacturing needs, while developing internal capabilities to provide optionality and support certain small-scale and short-term manufacturing needs, including potential manufacture of registration batches to support an SB206 NDA submission and initial commercialization inventory. Any delays or disruptions in our third-party manufacturers performing and completing the required technology transfer of the manufacturing processes and analytical methods for API development and commercial manufacturing under cGMP guidelines and regulations, or our inability to develop such capabilities internally, could impact the development and commercialization timelines of our product candidates, as well as increase costs. Further, if we do not appropriately coordinate with, project manage, or provide adequate internal expertise, resources and documentation to a third-party API manufacturer, we may not be successful, or may be delayed, in transferring the activities, processes, capabilities and services. For example, we recently terminated our existing statements of work, including the related technology transfer, under a master contract manufacturing agreement previously entered into with a third-party full-scale manufacturer to produce our API. While the master services agreement remains in place with this third-party API manufacturer for potential longer term needs, we are in active discussions with other third-party full-scale API manufacturers with the goal of identifying and qualifying a new third-party full-scale API manufacturer to assist with near-term and long-term manufacturing needs. If we are not able to timely engage and successfully complete the required technology transfer with a new partner to become the primary\nthird-party external supplier of our proprietary berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) drug substance, we will need to be able to produce sufficient quantities internally in order to support an NDA submission for SB206 and, if approved, material to support a commercial launch.\nWe believe increased utilization of and reliance upon third-party vendors and strategic partners for the performance of activities, processes and services can ultimately provide enhanced capabilities and operating efficiencies for us and any potential partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships we may enter. However, there can be no assurance that the technology transfer process with any of these potential API manufacturing partners, or with Orion, with whom we have formed a strategic alliance to enable Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on behalf of our global strategic partners, will be successful or that it will take place within the time period needed to meet our targeted timeframe for an SB206 NDA submission. For instance, we may not be successful in realizing the intended operating efficiencies from these arrangements based on a number of factors, including (i) delays or failures, including delays in our ability to transition applicable technology and processes to our vendors or partners, (ii) reduced quality, (iii) delayed receipt of goods or services, (iv) increased and unexpected costs on the part of the third-party vendors or strategic partners, (v) our requested near-term reduction in transfer activities, in an effort to reduce our near-term cash utilization, and (vi) certain incremental and discrete costs to effect this strategy upon resumption of the manufacturers\u2019 transfer activities. If we are unsuccessful in partnering with third-party manufacturers, we could experience delays in the development and commercialization timelines of our product candidates, as well as increased costs, in connection with shifting a greater portion of manufacturing to our internal resources or entering into new third party manufacturing arrangements. For example, we have a limited number of personnel who have experience in drug substance manufacturing and possess the expertise necessary to manufacture NVN1000.\nThe FDA requires API and finished drug product to be manufactured in accordance with cGMP and be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we, or a potential future partner, submit an NDA to the FDA. Orion has been inspected by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities, and we anticipate that any future third-party API manufacturer will have been similarly inspected, but future inspections could identify findings that could require remediation actions and cause delays to our regulatory approval process. Additionally, in connection with developing our internal capabilities, we will be required to qualify such space with the FDA to use it for small-scale manufacturing in order to ensure a safe operating environment, which will need to be evaluated by outside vendors. The tests performed by outside vendors include raw materials and product handling, process chemistry, air quality and waste disposal and containment. If our facilities, or the facilities of a third-party manufacturer, are found to be noncompliant with our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, we or our third-party manufacturers may be required to take remedial actions, causing further delays and increased costs. Moreover, the timing for conducting and reporting any results of such FDA inspections may be delayed or otherwise impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, except for the terms and conditions specified in our contractual arrangements with our contract manufacturers, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our API or drug products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nIf our existing inventories of API are depleted or damaged, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials, causing longer timelines, increased costs and delays in the development and commercialization of drug products, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nWe currently contract with multiple labeling and packaging materials suppliers for our drug products. If we or our labeling and packaging materials suppliers were unable to manufacture and provide the necessary drug product supplies to conduct our clinical trials, we may not be able to contract with another third party in a timely manner to meet our product candidate specifications and supply needs. As a result, we could experience delays in the development and commercialization timelines of our product candidates, as well as increased costs.\nChanges to our leadership team or operational resources could prove disruptive to our operations and have adverse consequences for our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we undergo changes and transitions among the ranks of senior executives and other senior-level managers, including during 2019 and 2020, when we announced several changes to our executive leadership team, and in 2021, as two senior-level managers are departing the Company in the first quarter of 2021. Managing transitions with senior executives or other senior-level managers may divert our existing management team\u2019s attention from our core operations, and the recent\ntransitions we have experienced may make it more difficult for us to retain existing employees. In addition, the recent transitions we have experienced have increased our dependency on the remaining members of the senior executive team and other senior-level managers within the organization. We have incurred costs related to transitions in our management team, including severance payments, and have required departing executives to agree to certain obligations in their separation agreements. We also expect to incur recruitment costs related to the hiring of new executives or engaging other operational resources from time to time.\nMoreover, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given our current financial position, recent actions taken to align our resources with our operating strategy, and the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. For instance, in 2018, our board approved and established the Tangible Stockholder Return Plan, or the Performance Plan, which is a performance-based long-term incentive plan, to incentivize employees, but there can be no assurance that we will achieve either or both share price targets during the term of the Performance Plan, that we will have sufficient cash on hand to pay cash bonuses under the Performance Plan at the time any share price target is achieved or within the time frames required for payment of the bonuses, or that we will receive stockholder approval to pay bonuses in shares of our common stock in lieu of some or all of such cash payment, if sought. These factors may impact our ability to retain key employees. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe rely on third parties to supply raw materials necessary to manufacture our API and drug products. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines for raw materials, we may be unable to manufacture API or drug product which could jeopardize the start of preclinical studies or clinical trials and potentially delay or cause failure to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the raw materials necessary to produce the API and drug products we require. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, including nitric oxide, that are used in the manufacture of our product candidates, drugs (once approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authority) or the drug products we supply to others, and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials, importantly nitric oxide, necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately for commercial sale, or to satisfy our obligations to others. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current suppliers or with any alternate suppliers. We currently obtain our raw material supplies for finished drug products through individual purchase orders. With future third-party manufacturers of our product candidates, we will not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials, including nitric oxide. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of the raw material components to manufacture drug products for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a raw material supplier could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we or our future third-party manufacturers are unable to purchase these raw materials, including nitric oxide, after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nUnexpected results in the analysis of raw materials, the API or drug product or problems with the quality systems supporting analytical work, whether conducted internally or by third-party service providers, could adversely affect our development and commercialization timelines and result in increased costs of our development programs.\nWe currently rely on third parties to test most of the raw materials necessary to produce our API and drug products. In the future, third parties engaged directly by us or by our API and drug product contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, may test all such raw materials. It is a regulatory requirement that raw materials are tested and there are a limited number of suppliers for testing these raw materials. There may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the supply of these raw materials for the manufacture of API or drug product. Additionally, the analytical equipment used by these third-parties must be maintained and operational. Except for the terms established within our, or our CMOs\u2019, contracts with the third parties responsible for testing raw materials, we have limited ability to control the process or timing of their testing work. Additionally, if the results do not meet specifications, then obtaining additional raw materials may jeopardize the CMOs\u2019 ability to manufacture API and/or drug product and the start or overall conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials which could result in the delay of developing or commercializing our product candidates. We currently perform internal tests, and in the future our CMOs will perform tests, to ensure the API and drug product meets quality specifications. The analytical equipment used by us or our CMOs to perform these tests must be maintained, qualified, calibrated and operational. If there are equipment problems or if the results of the analytical testing do not meet our quality specifications, then manufacturing\nadditional API or drug product may increase costs and may jeopardize our or the CMOs\u2019 ability to manufacture API and/or drug product and the start or overall conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials which could result in the delay of developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party suppliers and manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur manufacturing activities, and the manufacturing activities of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates such as nitric oxide and other hazardous compounds. Further, our manufactured drug substance and drug products may be considered hazardous materials under applicable laws and regulations. Our manufacturing activities, whether conducted by us or our third party suppliers and manufacturers, like all manufacturing processes that utilize hazardous materials, including those under high pressures, must be properly controlled to avoid unintended reactions or other accidents that could cause injury or damage to personnel, equipment or property. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are transported and stored at our suppliers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending use and disposal. We and our suppliers and manufacturers cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, injury to our service providers and others and environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the manufacturing controls and safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for handling, transporting and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk (i) that the laws and regulations will not restrict our or our third-party suppliers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 ability to use, manufacture, store, transport, handle or dispose of such materials or (ii) of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials and processes. If these risks were to materialize, we could experience an interruption of our business operations and we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our financial resources.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could expose us to liability and hurt our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) FDA laws and regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, (ii) manufacturing standards, (iii) federal, state and foreign data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations.\nWe have recently taken actions to reduce our internal resources, and we may encounter difficulties in managing our business as a result of these actions, or the attrition that may occur following these actions, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits from these actions.\nFrom time to time, including in November 2018 and February 2020, we have taken actions intended to reduce our internal resources in order to align with our business and operating strategy. We have experienced additional employee attrition following these actions. These actions and any further actions and/or attrition that may occur in the future, result in the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain roles and responsibilities across the organization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the actions we have taken and may take in the future may not achieve anticipated benefits or may not enable achievement of our operating strategy. Our management may\nneed to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day strategic and operational activities, and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these organizational changes. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage our operations or recruit and retain qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and operations, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. If our management is unable to effectively manage the business with current internal resources, our expenses may be more than expected, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, and we may be subject to penalties, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or the conditions of approval or contain requirements for potentially costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, and continued compliance with cGMP and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may fail to obtain any marketing approvals, lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of executive orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these or future executive actions will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded or replaced under the Biden Administration. The policies and priorities of the Biden Administration are difficult to predict and could materially impact the regulation governing our product candidates. In addition, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in the United States, any such approval will be limited to the specific indication authorized by the FDA. If we are found to be in violation of FDA and other regulations restricting the promotion of any approved products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to criminal penalties, substantial fines or other sanctions and damage awards.\nIf our clinical trials are successful, we intend to seek approval for our product candidates for various indications for use. If we obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates with an indication statement for the treatment of one or more of these indications, we will likely be prohibited from marketing any approved products for uses outside of those for which we have received approval.\nThe regulations relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses are complex and subject to substantial interpretation by the FDA and other government agencies. Products may not be promoted for uses that are not approved in the labeling by the FDA or EMA. Physicians may, following FDA approval, nevertheless prescribe our products off-label to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. We intend to implement compliance and training programs designed to ensure that our sales and marketing practices comply with applicable regulations. Notwithstanding these programs, the FDA or other government agencies may allege or find that our practices constitute prohibited promotion of our products for unapproved uses. We also cannot be sure that our employees will comply with company policies and applicable regulations regarding the promotion of products for unapproved uses, but we may nevertheless be deemed responsible for their marketing activities.\nIn recent years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Many of these investigations originate as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions under the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim, or caused a false claim to be submitted, to the government for payment. The person bringing a qui tam suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement. Qui tam suits, also commonly referred to as \u201cwhistleblower suits,\u201d are often brought by current or former employees. In a qui tam suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone.\nIf the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to warning letters, untitled letters, substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law. Since its enactment, however, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a United States District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and, therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how or when it will rule on the case. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law or our business in the future.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may, among other things, result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nWe are subject to governmental economic sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nAs a United States company, we are subject to United States import and export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, and we are required to import and export our product candidates, technology and services in compliance with those laws and regulations, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic embargo and trade sanction programs administered by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. United States economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by United States sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent doing any business, directly or indirectly, with countries, governments and persons targeted by United States sanctions and to ensure that our product candidates, if approved, are not exported or used by countries, governments and persons targeted by United States sanctions, such measures may be circumvented. Furthermore, if we export our product candidates, if approved, the exports may require authorizations, including a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorization. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Failure to comply with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may expose us to government investigations and penalties. If we are found to be in violation of United States sanctions or import or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, including possible incarceration for those individuals responsible for the violations, the loss of export or import privileges and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we may conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we commercialize our product candidates and eventually commence international sales and business, we may engage with collaborators and third-party intermediaries to sell our products abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nChanges in and failures to comply with United States and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our collaborators\u2019, service providers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon \u201ccovered entities\u201d (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, or PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA and many of which may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CRO, and contractors must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA and United Kingdom, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. Member states of the EEA may impose further obligations relating to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information. Further, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual\nclauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. In addition, the GDPR provides for robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, following January 1, 2021, we will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. If we fail to comply with any such data protection laws, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices, and/or enforcement actions, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. As we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our, or our potential future commercial partners\u2019, commercialization efforts for our product candidates.\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into may impose, various development, commercialization, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees (including through specific provisions in employment contracts), corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be materially impaired.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture any of our current or future product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may adversely impact our business.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage, for reasons including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022others may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to certain of our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our trade secret or similar rights;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for our existing stockholders.\nOur stock price has in the past been, and is likely to be in the future, volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. During the period from January 1, 2020 to February 10, 2021, the closing sales price of our common stock ranged from a high of $3.11 per share to a low of $0.22 per share. As a result of this volatility, our existing stockholders may not be able to sell their stock at a favorable price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including reports of clinical trial results, steps in the regulatory approval process and the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and emerging growth companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Any actual or perceived negative operational developments or market or industry fluctuations may compound each other\u2019s negative impacts on the price of liquidity of our common stock.\nWe, and certain of our directors and current and former officers, have in the past been named as parties to putative stockholder class action lawsuits and may be subject to litigation or other claims again in the future, and such litigation or other claims could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business and financial condition, results of operations to suffer.\nPutative stockholder class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers in 2017. The court dismissed those putative stockholder class actions with prejudice, and we have concluded that these matters are closed. We currently have no other pending litigation against us, but we may face additional claims in the future. If we face similar litigation or other claims again in the future, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and their ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we expect insurance to cover certain costs associated with defending such litigation, insurance coverage may be insufficient and could require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation or claims made against us and/or our directors and officers that could negatively affect perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions include those establishing (i) a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors, (ii) no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates and (iii) other provisions.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and/or our directors, officers, or employees or agents.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or agents to us and/or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These choice of forum provisions do not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our choice of forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us and/or our directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees or agents.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had NOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes of $187.3 million and $186.8 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2028 and 2023 for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Our ability to utilize NOL carryforward amounts to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including if future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carryforward amounts prior to their expiration. Additionally, our ability to fully utilize these United States tax assets can also be adversely affected by \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, in a three-year period. Any ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by \u201c5% stockholders,\u201d as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382 of the Code in any three-year period. Although we have not completed a full analysis under Section 382, our initial public offering, or IPO, combined with our subsequent equity offerings may have resulted in an ownership change as defined in Section 382. Further, we may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of further shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us and/or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our regulatory clearance timelines, clinical trial results or operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, we expect capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. Additionally, any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, we expect capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock is expected to be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur internal computer systems, or those of any of our existing or potential future collaborators, CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our increased reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to applicable data privacy and security law and regulations. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, including financial assets or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could be subject to material legal claims and incur liability or other negative consequences, including increased cybersecurity protection costs, damage to our reputation, disruption of our internal operations and delays in the further development of and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Morrisville, North Carolina, near major hurricane and tornado zones. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as enterprise financial systems, manufacturing resource planning or enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Our manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 facilities are located in multiple locations, where other natural disasters, pandemics or similar events, such as blizzards, tornadoes, fires, explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt their operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, pandemic illness and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our collaborators, manufacturers or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our collaborators\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. Any of the above could result in delays in the regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be impaired.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, however, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our technology platform or product candidates before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We\nmay not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to or from third parties. In particular, certain patents and patent applications covering our core technology platform are exclusively licensed from the University of North Carolina, or UNC, and under our license agreement with UNC, we rely on UNC to prosecute and maintain such patents and applications. Therefore, these patents and applications, and any other patents and applications that we may license from or to third parties, may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our current or any future product candidates, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned and licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our owned and licensed patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection while patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nChanges to patent laws in the United States or other countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, changes to the United States patent system have come into force under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, which was signed into law in September 2011. The Leahy-Smith Act included a number of significant changes to United States patent law. Under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position. While we cannot predict with certainty the impact the Leahy-Smith Act or any potential future changes to the United States or foreign patent systems will have on the operation of our business, the Leahy-Smith Act and such future changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, the first to file system under the Leahy-Smith Act may incentivize companies like us in the biopharmaceutical industry to file patent applications as soon as possible, and filing applications as soon as possible runs the risk that the application will not have the supporting data to claim the broadest protection possible in the United States.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our owned and licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or\nlimit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nFinally, certain of our activities and our licensors\u2019 activities have been funded, and may in the future be funded, by the United States federal government. When new technologies are developed with United States federal government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the United States government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to United States industry. In addition, United States government-funded inventions must be reported to the government, United States government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products in the United States.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our owned and licensed patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent directed to our product candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our owned and licensed patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources than we do. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent or other intellectual property rights litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other product candidates. There could also be public announcements of the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage\npatent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our technology platform or product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in United States patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nThe United States has recently enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances, modifying some legal standards applied by the USPTO in examination of patent applications or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents, increase the likelihood of challenges to patents we obtain or license or weaken our ability to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could impair our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our invention in such countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our owned and licensed patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our owned and licensed patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our owned and licensed patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nMany countries, including EU countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may not be able to obtain licenses to third-party intellectual property. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our existing licenses may be terminated or may not be renewed, which could hurt our business.\nIn addition, our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product candidates or other business activities may be subject to\nclaims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We have conducted searches for information in support of patent protection and otherwise evaluating the patent landscape for nitric oxide releasing materials and products, and, based on these searches and evaluations to date, we do not believe that there are valid patents which contain granted claims that could be asserted with respect to our nitric oxide-based product candidates.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to redesign our infringing products or obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Moreover, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies or universities. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, materially harming to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks, including with respect to our Nitricil technology and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOutside of the United States we cannot be certain that any country\u2019s patent or trademark office will not implement new rules that could seriously affect how we draft, file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications.\nWe cannot be certain that the patent or trademark offices of countries outside the United States will not implement new rules that increase costs for drafting, filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications or that any such new rules will not restrict our ability to file for patent protection. For example, we may elect not to seek patent protection in some jurisdictions or for some product candidates in order to save costs. We may be forced to abandon or return the rights to specific patents due to a lack of financial resources.", "PERMNO": 16303, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NOVN"}
