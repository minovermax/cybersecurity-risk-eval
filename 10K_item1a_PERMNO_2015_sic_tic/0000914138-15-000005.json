{"cik": "914138", "company": "MIDDLEBURG FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to various risks, including the risks described below. The Company\u2019s (\u201cWe\u201d or \u201cOur\u201d) operations, financial condition, performance and, the market value of our securities could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known or risks that we currently deem immaterial.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, is based upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nopen new financial service centers;\n\u2022\nattract deposits to those locations; and\n\u2022\nidentify attractive loan and investment opportunities.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future. Our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth, maintain cost controls and asset quality and successfully integrate any new financial service centers into our organization.\nAs we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new financial service centers, we expect to incur construction costs and increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. We generally must absorb those higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, our plans to grow could depress our earnings in the short run, even if we efficiently execute this growth.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nOur banking subsidiary faces vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies and credit unions for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Our non-banking subsidiary faces competition from money managers and investment brokerage firms.\nTo a limited extent, our banking subsidiary also competes with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRevenue from our mortgage lending segment is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates, the competitive and regulatory environment or new legislation and may adversely impact our profits.\nThe revenue stream from mortgage lending is dependent upon our ability to originate loans. We sold our ownership interest in Southern Trust Mortgage on May 15, 2014, but continue to originate mortgage loans internally as well as through a business arrangement with Southern Trust Mortgage whereby the Bank acts as an investor in purchasing loans originated by the mortgage company. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates and decreased refinancing activity. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect mortgage originations and, consequently, reduce income from mortgage lending activities. Deteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages.\nCFPB regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB rules requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing and fees. The rule also contains new disclosure requirements at mortgage loan origination and in monthly statements. These requirements will likely require significant personnel resources and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur profitability will depend upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the pricing of securities, loans and deposits, the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value we can recognize on the sale of mortgage and home equity loans in the secondary market. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but we will be unable to eliminate it. Based on our asset/liability position at December 31, 2014, a rise in interest rates would increase our net interest income slightly in the short term. Our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside of our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally.\nNew regulations could adversely impact our earnings due to, among other things, increased compliance costs or costs due to noncompliance.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that satisfy this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d safe-harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact our growth or profitability.\nAdditionally, on December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, adopted final rules (the \u201cFinal Rules\u201d) implementing the Volcker Rule embodied in Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Rules prohibit banking entities from, among other things, (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (\u201ccovered funds\u201d). The Final Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The Final Rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Community banks, such as Middleburg Bank, have been afforded some relief under the final rules. If such banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. government, agency, state and municipal obligations, they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures. The Final Rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period has been extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2017. In 2014, the Company sold certain securities in its portfolio to conform with the Volcker Rule and we believe that we are in full compliance with the Rule.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market area. A major change in the real estate market, such as deterioration in the value of collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect our clients\u2019 ability to repay these loans, which in turn could negatively impact us. While we are in one of the fastest growing real estate markets in the United States, risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result credit losses may occur in the future.\nWe may be adversely affected by further deterioration of economic conditions in our market area.\nOur banking operations are located primarily in the Virginia counties of Loudoun, Fairfax, Fauquier and Prince William and also in the Town of Williamsburg and the City of Richmond. Because our lending is concentrated in this market, we will be affected\nby the general economic conditions in these areas. Changes in the economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing. A further decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact the demand for banking products and services generally, which could negatively affect our financial condition and performance.\nA loss of our senior officers could impair our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our business.\nMany community banks attract customers based on the personal relationships that the banks\u2019 officers and customers establish with each other and the confidence that the customers have in the officers. We depend on the performance of our senior officers. These officers have many years of experience in the banking industry and have numerous contacts in our market area. The loss of the services of any of our senior officers, or the failure of any of them to perform management functions in the manner anticipated by our board of directors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success will be dependent upon the board\u2019s ability to attract and retain quality personnel, including these individuals. We do not carry key man life insurance on our senior officers.\nIf we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth, we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable. This could negatively affect our performance and the value of our common stock.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. We anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at new branch locations as well as investment opportunities. However, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time. We may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed.\nOur profitability and the value of your investment may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. Recently enacted, proposed and future banking legislation and regulations have had, and will continue to have, or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry. These regulations, which are intended to protect depositors and not our shareholders, and the interpretation and application of them by federal and state regulators, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. Our success depends on our continued ability to maintain compliance with these regulations. Some of these regulations may increase our costs and thus place other financial institutions that are not subject to similar regulation in stronger, more favorable competitive positions.\nBanking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors, and not investors.\nBank regulations, and the interpretation and application of them by regulators, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and can be expected to influence earnings and growth. In addition, these regulations may limit the Company\u2019s growth and the return to investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on depositors and the creation of financial service centers. Information on the regulations that impact the Company are included in Item 1., \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d. Although these regulations impose costs on the Company, they are intended to protect depositors, and should not be assumed to protect the interest of shareholders. The regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interest of investors.\nTrading in our common stock has been sporadic and volume has been light. As a result, shareholders may not be able to quickly and easily sell their common stock.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market and a number of brokers offer to make a market in common stock on a regular basis, trading volume to date has been limited and there can be no assurance that an active and liquid market for the common stock will develop.\nOur directors and officers have significant voting power.\nOur directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 5.00% of our common stock and may purchase additional shares of our common stock by exercising vested stock options. By voting against a proposal submitted to shareholders, the directors and officers may be able to make approval more difficult for proposals requiring the vote of shareholders such as mergers, share exchanges, asset sales and amendment to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation.\nAn inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce our earnings.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nactual loan loss history;\n\u2022\nvolume, growth, and composition of the loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe amount of nonperforming loans and the value of their related collateral;\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values;\n\u2022\nthe effect of current economic conditions on a borrower\u2019s ability to pay; and\n\u2022\nother factors deemed relevant by management.\nThese determinations are based upon estimates that are inherently subjective, and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events; therefore, realized losses may differ from current estimates. Changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which are generally beyond our control, could increase actual loan losses significantly. As a result, actual losses could exceed our current allowance estimate. We cannot provide assurance that our allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover actual loan losses should such losses differ significantly from the current estimates.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our methodology for assessing our asset quality will succeed in properly identifying impaired loans or calculating an appropriate loan loss allowance. We could sustain losses if we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers or fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb losses, or if bank regulatory authorities require us to increase the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process, our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nGovernment measures to regulate the financial industry, including the Dodd-Frank Act, subject us to increased regulation and could aversely affect us.\nAs a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the state and federal levels. As a result of the financial crisis and related global economic downturn that began in 2007, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, increased public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of our financial services practices. The Dodd-Frank Act includes significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. Because the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on future regulatory rulemaking and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations implemented thereunder limit debit card interchange fees, restrict ownership of covered funds, increase FDIC assessments, impose new requirements on mortgage lending, and establish more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies. As a result of these and other provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, we will experience additional costs, restrictions on allowable investments, as well as limitations on the products and services we offer and on our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, which may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Basel III capital framework will require higher levels of capital and liquid assets, which could adversely affect the Company's net income and return on equity.\nThe Basel III capital framework represents the most comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. banking capital framework in over two decades. This new capital framework and related changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and create additional compliance burdens, especially for community banks. The Basel III Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, to maintain significantly more capital as a result of higher required capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk weightings and calculations. As a result of the Basel III Capital Rules, many community banks could be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios, in order to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. The Company believes that it maintains sufficient levels of Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 capital to comply with the Basel III Final Rules, as currently scheduled to be effective and implemented. However, the Company can offer no assurances with regard to the ultimate effect of the Basel III Capital Rules, and satisfying increased capital requirements imposed by the Basel III Capital Rules may require the Company to limit its banking operations, retain net income or reduce dividends to improve regulatory capital levels, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital in the Company and in our subsidiaries. The ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends to us is limited by the bank\u2019s obligations to maintain sufficient capital, earnings and liquidity and by other general restrictions on their dividends under federal and state bank regulatory requirements. In September 2014, we increased the dividend to $0.10 per share from $0.07 per share. We cannot be certain as to when, if ever, the dividend may be increased further, nor can we be certain that future reductions of the dividend will not be made.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) on our financial condition. These guidelines also require that we review our net income for the current and past four quarters, and the level of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 Capital instruments for those periods, as well as our projected rate of earnings retention.\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy, the board of directors of a bank holding company should also consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to the organization\u2019s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company\u2019s dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the current period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements or the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe Basel III rules require us to maintain a capital conservation buffer above well capitalized capital levels. If we fail to maintain the capital conservation buffer, we may be subject to restrictions on discetionary payouts including the payment of dividends.\nFurther, we cannot pay any dividends on the common stock, or acquire any shares of common stock, if any distributions on our trust preferred securities are in arrears.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may cause our earnings to decrease.\nThe limit on FDIC coverage has been increased to $250,000 for all accounts. In addition, the costs associated with bank resolutions or failures have substantially depleted the DIF. As a result, the FDIC has implemented a new methodology by which it will assess premium amounts. The FDIC adopted a final rule in 2011, to change the FDIC\u2019s assessment rates as well as providing that the assessment base will be the institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. Although the burden of replenishing the DIF will be placed primarily on institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, we expect higher annual deposit insurance assessments than we historically incurred before the financial crisis began several years ago. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or special assessments could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 88635, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MBRG"}
