Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s businesses, operations, liquidity and financial condition are subject to various risks. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be significantly affected by the risks below or additional risks not presently known to the Company or by risks that the Company presently deems immaterial, such as changes in the economy, disruptions due to terrorist activity or manmade or natural disasters, or changes in law or accounting standards. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that the Company considers material.\nEconomic and political risks\nThe Company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected by market conditions and by global and economic conditions and other factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is affected by general economic factors, the strength of retail economies and political conditions that are beyond its control. Retail economies are impacted by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which in turn, are affected by general economic factors. These general economic factors include, among other factors:\n\u2022\nrecession, inflation, deflation, unemployment and other factors adversely affecting consumer spending patterns generally;\n\u2022\nconditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending in the home retail industry specifically;\n\u2022\nconditions affecting the housing markets;\n\u2022\nconsumer credit availability and consumer debt levels;\n\u2022\nmaterial input costs, including fuel and energy costs and labor cost inflation;\n\u2022\nforeign currency translation;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and the ability to hedge interest rate risks;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies including tax policies relating to value-added taxes, import and export duties and quotas, antidumping regulations and related tariffs, import and export controls and social compliance standards;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters, conflicts and terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nunfavorable economic conditions in the United States, the U.K., continental Europe, Asia and elsewhere; and\n\u2022\nunstable economic and political conditions, lack of legal regulation enforcement, civil unrest and political activism, particularly in Asia.\nThe occurrence of negative events related to any of the foregoing may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s U.K. operations and sales may be materially adversely affected by the exit of the U.K. from the European Union.\nThe referendum held in the U.K. on June 23, 2016 resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the European Union. Such an exit from the European Union would be unprecedented and it is unclear what impact this would have on the U.K.\u2019s access to the EU Single Market and on the legal and regulatory environment in which the Company operates, as well as its effect on the global macroeconomic environment. Net sales attributable to U.K. domiciled businesses were $92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and represent approximately 13% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales for the period.\nSignificant uncertainty remains regarding the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit and its consequences could adversely impact the U.K. economy, customers and investor confidence. Such uncertainty may contribute to additional market volatility, including volatility in the value of the U.K. pound and European euro, and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs and other trade policies implemented by the U.S. and other governments.\nRecently, the U.S. government has announced and, in some cases, implemented additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including finished products and raw materials such as steel and aluminum. These tariffs and potential tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and may limit the amount of these goods and materials that may be imported into the U.S.\nA majority of the Company\u2019s products are sourced from vendors in China, and in 2018 tariffs were imposed by the United States Trade Representative on certain finished products imported by the Company into the U.S. from China. The tariffs have been implemented in multiple phases, with effective dates of July and August 2018, for a 25% tariff on certain products, and with an effective date of September 2018 for a 10% tariff on certain other products, which may increase to 25%. In response to the tariffs, the Company may seek to increase prices to its customers, which may diminish demand for its products. Additionally, if the Company is unable to increase prices, this may result in the lowering of the gross margin that the Company realizes from the sale of its products. The results of either eventuality could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the imposition of further policies restrictive on trade by the U.S. government, or the imposition of retaliatory policies or tariffs by other governments, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity and financial risks\nThe Company has substantial indebtedness and the highly seasonal nature of the Company\u2019s business impacts its borrowing needs.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness and is dependent on the availability of its bank loan facilities to finance its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $315.0 million of consolidated debt, including $42.1 million under its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Agreement\u201d) and $272.9 million outstanding under a senior secured term loan credit facility (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d and, collectively with the ABL Agreement, the \u201cDebt Agreements\u201d). The ABL Agreement provides for, among other things, a maximum aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million and will mature on March 2, 2023. The Term Loan will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, which payments commenced June 30, 2018. At December 31, 2018, borrowings under the Debt Agreements represented approximately 44.5% of total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders\u2019 equity). The maximum borrowing amount under the ABL Agreement may be increased to up to $200.0 million if certain conditions are met. One or more tranches of additional term loans (the \u201cIncremental Facilities\u201d) may be added under the Term Loan if certain conditions are met. The Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) $50.0 million plus (ii) an unlimited amount so long as, in the case of (ii) only, the Company\u2019s secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan, is no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 subject to certain limitations and for the period defined.\nThe Company utilized the proceeds of borrowings under the Debt Agreements (i) to repay in full all existing indebtedness for borrowed money under its former credit agreement and (ii) to finance, in part, the acquisition of Filament, the refinancing of certain indebtedness of Filament and its subsidiaries, and the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Company may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to, its indebtedness. In addition, the Company\u2019s business is seasonal with a significant amount of its revenue realized during the latter portion of the year. Therefore, the Company\u2019s borrowing needs fluctuate widely based upon its seasonal working capital requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s leverage and the effects of seasonal fluctuations in its cash flow, borrowing requirements and ability to borrow could have significant negative consequences on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nimpairing the Company\u2019s ability to meet the financial covenants, if and when applicable, contained in the ABL Agreement or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under its Debt Agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or sell equity to fund the Company\u2019s working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service, strategic initiatives or for other obligations or purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy, the markets, regulatory requirements, its operations or business;\n\u2022\nmaking the Company more highly leveraged than some of its competitors, which may place the Company at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nmaking the Company more vulnerable to downturns in the economy or its business;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for the Company to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022\nrisking credit rating downgrades of the Company, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; and\n\u2022\npreventing the Company from borrowing additional funds as needed or taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nTo the extent the Company incurs additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, the Company\u2019s actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. The Company\u2019s cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service its outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and the Company may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance its debt.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet certain covenants or comply with other requirements of its Debt Agreements may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s assets, financial position and cash flows.\nThe ABL Agreement, under certain circumstances, requires the Company to maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result of this and other covenants within the Debt Agreements, the Company may be limited in its ability to incur additional debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing and may prevent the Company from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the covenants or requirements in its Debt Agreements may be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under the Debt Agreements, which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of the Company\u2019s other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Company\u2019s Debt Agreements, after the expiration of any grace periods, the Company\u2019s lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Company\u2019s debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, the Company cannot assure that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full the amounts due under the Debt Agreements or the Company\u2019s other indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings, and discount rate applied to sale of receivables, are subject to interest rate fluctuations and an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings bear interest at floating rates. An increase in interest rates would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability. To the extent that the Company\u2019s access to credit may be restricted because of its own performance, its bank lenders\u2019 performances or conditions in the capital markets generally, the Company would not be able to operate normally.\nThe Company\u2019s Receivables Purchase Agreement also depends upon LIBOR, as it is a component of the discount rate applicable to the agreement. If LIBOR increases, the Company may not be able to rely on the Receivables Purchase Agreement, which could have a material and adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances and/or integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company has historically achieved growth through acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. The Company seeks acquisition opportunities that complement and expand its operations, some of which are based outside the United States. The Company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the business of Filament or future acquired businesses into its existing business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. Potential difficulties the Company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to successfully combine businesses in a manner that permits the Company to achieve the cost synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the consummation of the acquisition and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to integrate acquired companies\u2019 products and services;\n\u2022\nchallenges leveraging the customer information and technology of the two companies;\n\u2022\nchallenges effectuating the Company\u2019s diversification strategy, including challenges achieving revenue growth from sales of each company\u2019s products and services to the clients and customers of the other company;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks, and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, clients, employees, lenders, and other constituencies; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in diversion of the attention of each company\u2019s management, which could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, clients, employees, and other constituencies or the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could reduce each company\u2019s operating results or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nForeign exchange variability and currency controls could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect the Company\u2019s sales and profitability and can result in exchange losses because the Company has operations and assets located outside the United States. The Company, especially its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily U.K. pounds, and to a lesser degree, Chinese renminbi, Euros, Hong Kong dollars, Mexican peso and Canadian dollars. Such transactions affect the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Foreign operations expose the Company to foreign currency fluctuations, for both transactions and financial reporting translation purposes. In the consolidated financial statements, local currency financial results are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rates prevailing during the reporting periods. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and earnings of the Company\u2019s international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. As described below, during times of a weakening U.S. dollar, the Company\u2019s costs related to the supplies and inventory it sources internationally will increase.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s inventory is purchased from Chinese suppliers in U.S. dollars, including inventory purchased by the Company\u2019s international operations. As a result, the gross margin from international operations is subject to volatility from movements in exchange rates, which could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations and profitability from international operations. The Company has entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge the volatility of exchange rates related to a portion of its international inventory purchases. The Company cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. If the Chinese renminbi should appreciate against the U.S. dollar, the costs of the Company\u2019s products will likely rise over time because of the impact the strengthening renminbi will have on the Company\u2019s cost of sales, and the Company may not be able to pass on these price increases to its customers. The Company is also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations. Currency controls may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert currencies into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as needed, to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in countries imposing such controls, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nIf the Company expands its international operations, it will be subject to increased foreign exchange variability which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain large fixed costs that can affect its profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain large distribution facilities in its key markets, which represent high fixed rental costs relating to its leased facilities. In addition, significant portions of the Company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses, including leased showrooms, are fixed, as they neither increase nor decrease proportionally with sales. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s gross margins depend, in part, on its ability to spread sourcing costs, of which a significant portion are fixed, over its products sold. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company\u2019s ability to absorb certain sourcing costs and adversely affect its results of operations. This is exacerbated by the high degree of seasonality impacting the Company, which results in lower demand during the first two quarters of the year, while many of the operating costs remain fixed, which further affects profitability.\nCost reduction efforts may not be successful and restructuring benefits may not be realized.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, the Company may announce restructuring plans from time to time, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense savings. The implementation of restructuring plans could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, result in higher than anticipated charges and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to complete restructuring plans and achieve the anticipated benefits from a plan is subject to estimates and assumptions and may vary materially from the Company\u2019s expectations, including as a result of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Furthermore, following completion of a restructuring plan, the business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan.\nIf the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-term assets become impaired, the Company will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s long-term assets consists of goodwill recorded as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisitions; other identifiable intangible assets, including trade names; and fixed assets. At December 31, 2018, goodwill, net of impairment totaled $91.7 million. The Company does not amortize goodwill but rather reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its current fair value as determined based on the discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit or comparable market sales and earnings multiples, the goodwill or intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a decline in economic conditions and/or a slow, weak economic recovery, as well as sustained declines in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of the Company\u2019s products, adverse changes in interest rates, further corporate income tax reforms or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that the Company expects. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit includes developing estimates which are highly subjective and incorporate calculations that are sensitive to minor changes in underlying assumptions. Management\u2019s assumptions change as more information becomes available. Changes in these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reported earnings. If future operating performance of one or more of the Company\u2019s operating segments does not meet expectations, the Company may be required to record a significant charge during the period in which any impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-term assets is determined.\nIn 2018, the Company\u2019s European tableware business experienced a decline in operating performance and management reduced its expectations for future cash flows. The Company performed an interim impairment assessment in the third quarter of 2018, which resulted in a $2.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Events and circumstances indicated that $22.9 million of assets of the European tableware reporting unit might be impaired; however, the Company\u2019s estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be recovered. Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value.\nAs of October 1, 2018, the excess of fair value of the European kitchenware reporting unit, which carries goodwill of $10.0 million, was approximately 7% over its carrying value. Management\u2019s projections used to estimate the cash flows include increasing net sales and operational improvements expected as a result of the consolidation of locations in the U.K. As a result of the European restructuring plan, the European kitchenware and tableware reporting units were combined into one reporting unit as of January 1, 2019. Changes in any of the significant assumptions, including the identified restructuring activities, used in the valuation of the reporting unit could materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could potentially result in a material non-cash impairment charge.\nAs of October 1, 2018, the fair value of the U.S. reporting unit, which carries goodwill of approximately $81.6 million was approximately 9% over its carrying value. Management\u2019s projections used to estimate fair value included increasing net sales and the realizations of the savings expected from the Company\u2019s acquisition of Filament. Changes in any of the significant assumptions used in the valuation of the reporting unit could materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could potentially result in a material non-cash impairment charge.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition of Filament was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 805, which established a new basis of accounting for all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of March 2, 2018. The long-term assets acquired consist of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including trade names. If the future operating performance of Filament does not meet expectations, the Company may be required to record a significant charge during the period in which any impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-term assets is determined.\nThe Company is not currently aware of any negative changes in its assumptions that could lead to the fair value of the reporting units being less than the carrying value.\nThe recognition of an impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or any of the Company\u2019s assets would negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.\nThe Company\u2019s projections of product demand, sales and net income are highly subjective in nature and the Company\u2019s future sales and net income could vary materially from the Company\u2019s projections.\nFrom time to time, the Company may provide projections to its stockholders, lenders, the investment community, and other stakeholders of the Company\u2019s future sales and net income. Since the Company does not have long-term purchase commitments from customers and the customer order and shipment process is very short, it is difficult for the Company to accurately predict the demand for many of its products, or the amount and timing of the Company\u2019s future sales and related net income. The Company\u2019s projections are based on management\u2019s best estimate of sales using historical sales data and other information deemed relevant. These projections are highly subjective since sales can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of retail customers and due to other risks described in this Annual Report. Additionally, changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make the Company\u2019s inventory management more difficult. Because the Company\u2019s ability to forecast product demand and the timing of related sales requires significant subjective input, future sales and net income could vary materially from the Company\u2019s projections.\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company self-insures a substantial portion of the costs of employee healthcare and workers compensation. This could result in higher volatility in the Company\u2019s earnings and exposes the Company to higher financial risks. The Company\u2019s medical costs in recent years have generally increased and an aging workforce and other employee demographics could result in an increase in medical costs beyond what the Company has experienced or expects. The Company has stop-loss coverage in place for catastrophic events, but the aggregate impact of a high number of claims up to the Company\u2019s stop-loss limit may have an effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls.\nThe Company does not expect that its disclosure controls or the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls are revised, as necessary, due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Based on the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the Filament business combination that is disclosed in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the Company has revised its controls relating to the review of the valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. If in the future the Company\u2019s controls become inadequate, it could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, its reputation may be adversely affected, its business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of its stock could decline.\nCustomer risks\nThe Company faces intense competition from other companies worldwide and if the Company is unable to compete successfully, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products are intensely competitive with the principal competitive factors being product innovation, brand name, product quality, aesthetic appeal to customers, packaging, breadth of product offerings, distribution capability, delivery time and price. Advantages or disadvantages in any of these competitive factors may be sufficient to cause the customer to consider changing providers of the kinds of products that the Company sells. The Company competes with many other suppliers, some of which are larger than the Company, have greater financial and other resources or employ brands that are more established, have greater consumer recognition or are more favorably perceived by consumers or retailers than the Company\u2019s brands. Some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with the Company. As a result of this competition, the Company could lose market share and sales, or be forced to reduce its prices to meet competition. If the Company\u2019s product offerings are unable to compete successfully, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s customer purchasing practices could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s wholesale customers include mass merchants, specialty stores, national chains, department stores, warehouse clubs, supermarkets, off-price retailers and Internet retailers. Unanticipated changes in purchasing and other practices by the Company\u2019s customers, including a customer\u2019s pricing and payment terms, inventory destocking, limitations on shelf space, more extensive packaging requirements, changes in order quantities, use of private label brands and other practices, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. While the Company generally orders products substantially in advance of the anticipated time of their sale by the Company, this trend may require the Company to shorten its lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand, which may require the Company to carry additional inventories. The Company\u2019s annual earnings and cash flows also depend to a great extent on the results of operations in the latter half of the year due to the seasonality of its sales. The Company\u2019s success and sales growth is also dependent on its evaluation of consumer preferences and changing trends.\nAs certain online retailers grow they may continue to demand lower pricing, special packaging, shorter lead times for the delivery of products, smaller more frequent shipments, or impose other requirements on product suppliers. The cost of compliance with customers\u2019 demands could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of the Company\u2019s wholesale customers are significantly larger than the Company, have greater financial and other resources and also purchase goods directly from vendors in Asia and elsewhere. Decisions by large customers to increase their purchases directly from overseas vendors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes or financial difficulties, including consolidations of ownership, restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations or other events that affect retailers, could result in fewer retailers selling the Company\u2019s products, reliance on a smaller group of customers, an increase in the risk of extending credit to these customers or limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts due from these customers. Although the Company has long-established relationships with many of its customers, the Company does not have any long-term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases. Purchases by the Company\u2019s customers are generally made using individual purchase orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control or change other terms of their business relationship with the Company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRetailers place great emphasis on timely delivery of products for specific selling seasons, especially during the third fiscal quarter, and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year. The Company cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to retailers. Failure to deliver products to the Company\u2019s retailers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and brands and result in a loss of customers or reduced orders.\nChanges at the Company\u2019s large customers, or actions taken by them, and consolidation in the retail industry could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn 2018, Walmart accounted for approximately 14% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales, and the Company\u2019s top ten customers accounted for approximately 56% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales. A material reduction in sales to Walmart or other top customers in the aggregate, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operating results. In addition, pressures by such customers that would cause the Company to materially reduce the price of its products could result in reduced operating margin. Any significant changes or financial difficulties that affect these customers, such as reduced sales by such customers (whether for reasons that affect a particular customer or the retail industry in general) may also result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company would also be subject to increased credit risk with respect to such customers. In particular, the concentration of the Company\u2019s business with Walmart extends to its international business, including in China, as well as through Vasconia in Mexico and the Company\u2019s strategic alliance in Canada, due to the market presence of Walmart in these foreign countries. Any changes in purchasing practices or decline in the financial condition, of Walmart or other large customers may have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s large customers also have significant purchasing leverage. Customers may demand lower pricing, special packaging, shorter lead times for the delivery of products or impose other requirements on product suppliers like the Company. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease or eliminate their purchases from the Company. These risks could be exacerbated if such large customers consolidate, or if the Company\u2019s smaller customers consolidate to become larger customers, which would increase their purchasing leverage. A reduction in the purchases of the Company\u2019s products by its wholesale customers or the costs of complying with customer business demands could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers could carry products that directly compete with the Company\u2019s products for retail space and consumer purchases. There is a risk that these customers could give higher priority to products of, or form alliances with, the Company\u2019s competitors. The failure of customers to provide the Company\u2019s products with similar or better levels of promotional support and retail space as competitors receive could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe rapidly changing retail environment could result in the loss of, or a material reduction in, sales to the Company\u2019s brick-and-mortar customers, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe retail environment is highly competitive. Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring online and through mobile commerce applications. If the Company\u2019s brick-and-mortar retail customers fail to maintain or grow their overall market position through the integration of physical retail presence and digital retail, these customers may experience financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could, in turn, substantially reduce the Company\u2019s revenues, increase credit risk and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively manage Filament\u2019s and the Company\u2019s existing Internet business, its reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nThe success of Filament\u2019s and the Company\u2019s Internet business depends, in part, on factors over which the Company may have limited control. The Company must successfully respond to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to Internet usage. The Company is also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues as the Company upgrades its website software; computer viruses; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; security breaches; data breaches; and consumer privacy concerns. In addition, the Company must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of improved technology, creative user interfaces and other Internet marketing tools such as paid search, which may increase its costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting customers. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in its Internet business, as well as damage the Company\u2019s reputation and brands.\nDemand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth.\nNew product introductions and product innovation are significant contributors to the Company\u2019s growth strategy and the Company\u2019s long-term success in the competitive retail environment depends in part on the Company\u2019s ability to develop and market a continuing stream of innovative new products that meet changing consumer preferences. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company\u2019s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.\nSupply chain risks\nInternational suppliers subject the Company to regional regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency exchange risk that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company sources its products from suppliers located principally in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company\u2019s vendors in Asia, from whom a substantial majority of the Company\u2019s products are sourced, are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company\u2019s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company\u2019s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China, where labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risen in some regions and labor in China may not continue to be available to the Company at costs consistent with historical levels. Changes in labor or other laws may be enacted, in China or in other countries in which the Company does business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and/or those of the Company\u2019s suppliers. Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the Company and its overseas vendors\u2019 profitability and business prospects. The Company does not have access to its vendors\u2019 financial information and the Company is unable to assess its vendors\u2019 financial condition, including their liquidity. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company\u2019s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s international trade subjects it to transportation risks.\nThe Company imports its products for delivery to its distribution centers, as well as arranges for its customers to import goods to which title has passed overseas or at a port of entry. For purchases that are to be delivered to its distribution centers, the Company arranges for transportation, primarily by sea, from ports in Asia and Europe to ports in the United States, principally New York/Newark/Elizabeth and Los Angeles/Long Beach, and in the U.K., principally Felixstowe. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risks incidental to such transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel costs, fuel shortages, the availability of ships, increased security restrictions, work stoppages, weather disruptions and carriers\u2019 ability to provide delivery services to meet the Company\u2019s shipping needs. Transportation disruptions and increased transportation costs could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of its products, which presents quality control risks to the Company.\nWith the exception of the Company\u2019s sterling silver products, the Company sources almost all of its products from suppliers located outside the United States, primarily in China, which restricts the Company\u2019s ability to monitor and control their manufacture of the Company\u2019s goods.\nAlthough the Company has agreements with its third party manufacturers regarding quality standards and regularly audits the facilities of its manufacturers through its quality control program, the third party manufacturers may not continue to meet the Company\u2019s quality standards, social standards regarding its workforce that are expected in the United States or legislation and regulations that apply to the products the Company contracts to manufacture. Failure by the Company\u2019s manufacturers to meet these standards could, in turn, increase order cancellations, returns and price concessions and decrease customer demand for the Company\u2019s products. Non-compliance with the Company\u2019s product standards, regulatory requirements or product recall (or other regulatory actions) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s product costs are subject to price fluctuation.\nVarious commodities comprise the raw materials used to manufacture the Company\u2019s products. The prices of these commodities have historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and have often depended on a variety of factors over which the Company has no control. Additionally, labor costs represent a significant component of the Company\u2019s supplier\u2019s manufacturing costs and the Company\u2019s suppliers may increase the prices they charge the Company if they experience rising labor costs. The cost of producing and distributing the Company\u2019s products is also sensitive to energy costs, duties and tariffs. The selling prices of the Company\u2019s products have not always increased in response to raw material, labor or other cost increases, and the Company is unable to determine to what extent, if any, it will be able to pass future cost increases through to its customers. The Company\u2019s inability to come to favorable agreements with its suppliers or to pass increased costs through to the Company\u2019s customers could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nIntellectual property risks\nThe loss of certain licenses or material changes in royalty rates could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating margin and cash flow.\nSignificant portions of the Company\u2019s business are dependent on trade names, trademarks and patents, some of which are licensed from third parties. In 2018, sales of licensed brands accounted for approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s gross sales. The Company\u2019s licenses for many of these brands require it to pay royalties based on sales. Many of these license agreements are subject to termination by the licensor, if, for example, the Company fails to satisfy certain minimum sales obligations or breaches the terms of the license. The loss of significant licenses or a material increase in the royalty rates the Company pays or other new terms negotiated upon renewal of such licenses could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s operating margins and cash flow from operations or otherwise adversely affect its business.\nThe Company holds certain rights to use the Farberware brand for kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears and certain other products which together represent a material portion of its sales, through a fully-paid, royalty-free license for a term that expires in 2195, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances. The licensor is a joint venture of which the Company is a 50% owner. The other 50% owner of the joint venture has the right to terminate the Company\u2019s license if the Company materially breaches any of the material terms of the license and fails to cure the material breach within 180 days of notice of the breach, if it is determined in an arbitration proceeding that money damages alone would not be sufficient compensation to the licensor and that the breach is so egregious as to warrant termination of the license and forfeiture of the Company\u2019s rights to use the brand under that license agreement. If the Company were to lose the Farberware license for kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears and other products through termination as a result of an uncured breach, its business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nSales of KitchenAid branded products, to a lesser extent, also represent a material portion of the Company\u2019s sales. The Company\u2019s license to use the KitchenAid brand is subject to a license agreement that has a three-year term that will expire in December 2021. The Company originally entered into a licensing arrangement for use of the KitchenAid brand in 2000, and has renewed the license, typically for three-year periods, since that time. Although it expects to be able to renew its current KitchenAid license prior to its expiration, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so on reasonable terms, or at all, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately establish or protect its intellectual property rights, and the infringement or loss of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could harm its business.\nTo establish and protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, the Company relies upon a combination of U.S., foreign and multi-national patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, together with licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. The measures that the Company takes to protect its intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating the Company\u2019s intellectual property, or from breaching their contractual obligations to the Company.\nThe Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark, service mark and patent registrations, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional marks, patents or other intellectual property, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of its pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if such applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose, declare invalid or otherwise challenge these registrations. Failure to obtain registrations for the Company\u2019s intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit the Company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property rights and impede the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and operations in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend its intellectual property rights. If a competitor or collaborator files a patent application claiming technology also claimed by the Company, or a trademark application claiming a trademark, service mark or trade dress also used by the Company, in order to protect the Company\u2019s rights, the Company may have to participate in opposition or interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\nor a similar foreign agency. The Company cannot guarantee that the operation of its business does not infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, and the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. The costs associated with protecting intellectual property rights, including costs associated with litigation or administrative proceedings, may be material and there can be no assurance that any such litigation or administrative proceedings will be successful. Any such matters or proceedings could be burdensome, divert the time and resources of the Company\u2019s personnel and the Company may not prevail. Furthermore, even if the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, or other parties such as the Company\u2019s competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company\u2019s technology.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future do not protect, and the governments of certain foreign countries do not enforce, intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and government of the U.S., which may negate the Company\u2019s competitive or technological advantages in such markets. Moreover, any repeal or weakening of intellectual property laws or enforcement of those laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing the Company\u2019s rights. If the Company is unable to establish or adequately protect its intellectual property rights, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the Company is unable to protect the confidentiality of its proprietary information and know-how, the value of the Company\u2019s technology, products and services could be harmed significantly.\nIn addition to registered intellectual property, the Company relies on know-how and other proprietary information in operating its business. If this information is not adequately protected, then it may be disclosed or used in an unauthorized manner. To the extent that consultants, vendors, key employees or other third parties apply technology independently developed by them or by others to the Company\u2019s proposed products in the absence of a valid license or suitable non-disclosure or assignment of inventions provisions, disputes may arise as to the ownership of or rights to use such technology, which may not be resolved in the Company\u2019s favor. If other parties breach confidentiality or other agreements, or if the Company\u2019s registered intellectual property is not protected in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, this could harm the Company by enabling the Company\u2019s competitors and other entities, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use the Company\u2019s proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies.\nThe Company\u2019s brands are subject to reputational risks and damage to the Company\u2019s brands or reputation could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s brands and its reputation are among its most important assets. The Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon external perceptions of the Company, the quality of its products and its corporate and management integrity. The consumer goods industry is by its nature more prone to reputational risks than other industries. This has been compounded in recent years by the free flow of unverified information on the Internet and, in particular, on social media. Damage to the Company\u2019s brands or reputation or negative publicity or perceptions about the Company could adversely affect its business.\nOperational and regulatory risks\nInterruptions in the Company\u2019s operations caused by outside forces could cause material losses.\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operations could be subject to natural and man-made disasters, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, conflicts, acts of terrorism, health epidemics and other business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business, revenue and financial condition and increase the Company\u2019s costs and expenses. If the Company\u2019s or its manufacturers\u2019 warehousing facilities or transportation facilities are damaged or destroyed, the Company would be unable to distribute products on a timely basis, which could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s back-up operations may be inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses that may occur.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations present special challenges that the Company may not be able to meet, and this could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company conducts business outside of the United States through subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures. These entities have operations and assets in the U.K., Mexico, Canada, China and Hong Kong. Therefore, the Company is subject to increases and decreases in its investments in these entities resulting from the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These entities also bear risks similar to those risks faced by the Company. However, there are specific additional risks related to these organizations, such as the failure of the Company\u2019s partners or other investors to meet their obligations and higher credit and liquidity risks related to thinly capitalized entities. Failure of these entities or the Company\u2019s vendors to adhere to required regulatory or other standards, including social compliance standards, could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nIn addition, the Company sells its products in foreign countries and seeks to increase its level of international business activity. Accordingly, the Company is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nU.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries;\n\u2022\nforeign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced);\n\u2022\nimport regulations and duties;\n\u2022\nexport regulations (which require the Company to comply with stringent licensing regimes);\n\u2022\nanti-dumping regulations;\n\u2022\nprice and currency controls;\n\u2022\nexchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndividend remittance restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of assets;\n\u2022\nwar, civil uprisings and riots;\n\u2022\ngovernment instability;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations;\n\u2022\nlegal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied;\n\u2022\nunanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a global enterprise.\nAny significant violations of regulations or the occurrence of the events listed above could result in civil or criminal sanctions or the loss of export or other licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s organizational structure may limit its ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company operates in a regulated environment that imposes significant compliance requirements. Non-compliance with these requirements could subject the Company to sanctions and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject in the ordinary course of its business, in the United States and elsewhere, to many statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations that, if violated by the Company or its affiliates, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company is required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws adopted in many of the countries in which the Company does business which prohibit the Company from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and also require maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions. Under the FCPA, companies operating in the United States may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. The U.K. Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the FCPA. Civil and criminal penalties may be imposed for violations of these laws. In many of the countries in which the Company operates, particularly those with developing economies, it is or has been common for government officials and businesses to engage in business practices that are prohibited by these laws. If the Company does not properly implement and maintain practices and controls with respect to compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws, or if the Company fails to enforce those practices and controls properly, the Company may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on the Company\u2019s business and capital raising activities, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s employees, distributors, dealers and other agents could engage in conduct that is not in compliance with such laws for which the Company might be held responsible. If the Company\u2019s employees, distributors, dealers or other agents are found to have engaged in illegal practices, the Company could suffer substantial penalties and the reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company could be materially adversely affected.\nNew and future laws and regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce. These existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolutions of these issues could diminish the demand for the Company\u2019s products on the Internet and increase the cost of doing business.\nOn June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, (the \u201cWayfair Decision\u201d), a case that challenged existing law under which online retailers are not required to collect sales tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. The Wayfair Decision established that a state may enforce or adopt laws requiring online retailers to collect and remit sales tax if there is a substantial nexus between the online retailer\u2019s activity and the state, even if the retailer has no physical presence within the taxing state. If additional states enact and enforce laws requiring the Company to start calculating, collecting and remitting sales taxes in those states, the Company could incur substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state internet retailers could also create additional administrative burdens on the Company. This decision and the enactment and enforcement of laws resulting from this decision could also impact where the Company is required to file state income taxes. As a result, the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate, the cost of the Company\u2019s e-commerce business, and the growth of its e-commerce business, could be materially adversely effected by the Wayfair Decision and other new laws or regulations governing the internet and e-commerce. This potential negative impact on the Company\u2019s e-commerce business could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure in or compromise of the Company\u2019s operating systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and cause losses.\nThe Company relies on many information technology systems for the operation of its principal business functions, including, but not limited to, the Company\u2019s enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, inventory forecast and ordering and call center systems. In the case of the Company\u2019s inventory forecast and ordering system, most of the Company\u2019s orders are\nreceived directly through electronic connections with the Company\u2019s largest customers. Additionally, the success of certain product categories in a competitive marketplace is dependent upon the creation and launch of new, innovative products. Accordingly, to keep pace within a competitive retail environment, the Company uses and will continue to evaluate new technologies to improve the efficiency of designing new innovative products. The failure or compromise of any of these systems or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in efforts to minimize those risks and to comply with regulatory standards.\nThe Company employs information technology systems and operates websites which allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding the Company\u2019s customers, employees and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. The Company has made significant efforts to secure its computer network to mitigate the risk of possible cyber-attacks, including, but not limited to, data breaches, and is continuously working to upgrade its existing information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts security of the Company\u2019s computer networks could be compromised which could impact operations and confidential information could be misappropriated, which could lead to negative publicity, loss of sales and profits or cause the Company to incur significant costs to reimburse third- parties for damages, which could adversely impact profits.\nAdditionally, the Company must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect businesses and personal data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. GDPR is a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, effective in 2018, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to consumers who reside in the European Union, and imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act creates new data privacy rights, effective in 2020. Any failure to comply with GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other regulatory standards, could subject the Company to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company sells consumer products which involve an inherent risk of product liability claims.\nThe marketing of certain of the Company\u2019s consumer products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims or recalls or other regulatory or enforcement actions initiated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, by the Office of Fair Trading in the U.K., by other regulatory authorities or through private causes of action. The Company has in the past, and may have in the future, recalls (both voluntary and involuntary) of its products. Any defects in products the Company markets could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, adversely affect its relationship with its customers and decrease market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products and the strength of the brand names under which the Company markets such products. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage (which is subject to self-insured retention amounts) and could materially damage the Company\u2019s business and its financial condition. Additionally, the Company\u2019s product standards could be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives.\nThe Company may incur material costs due to environmental liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, foreign and multi-national laws and regulations relating to the environment. These include laws and regulations that govern:\n\u2022\ndischarges to the air, water and land;\n\u2022\nthe handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes; and\n\u2022\nremediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at the Company\u2019s facilities and at off-site disposal locations.\nThe Company may incur material costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies. Moreover, there are proposed international accords and treaties, as well as federal, state and local laws and regulations, which would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. In the event that the U.S. government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations, compliance with applicable laws or regulations may result in increased manufacturing costs for the Company\u2019s products, such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of the Company\u2019s products are made. The Company may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to the Company from its third-party suppliers. Although the Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at its facilities, the Company may not always be in compliance with such laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWallace Silversmiths de Puerto Rico, Ltd. (\u201cWSPR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, operates a manufacturing facility in San Germ\u00e1n, Puerto Rico that is leased from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (\u201cPRIDCO\u201d). In March 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) announced that the San Germ\u00e1n Ground Water Contamination site in Puerto Rico (the \u201cSite\u201d) had been added to the Superfund National Priorities List due to contamination present in the local drinking water supply.\nIn May 2008, WSPR received from the EPA a Notice of Potential Liability and Request for Information pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sections 9607(a) and 9604(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). In July 2011, WSPR received a letter from the EPA requesting access to the property that it leases from PRIDCO to conduct an environmental investigation, and the Company granted such access. In February 2013, the EPA requested access to conduct a further environmental investigation at the property. PRIDCO agreed to such access and the Company consented. The EPA conducted a further investigation during 2013 and, in April 2015, notified the Company and PRIDCO that the results from vapor intrusion sampling may warrant the implementation of measures to mitigate potential exposure to sub-slab soil gas. The Company reviewed the information provided by the EPA and requested that PRIDCO, as the property owner, find and implement a solution acceptable to the EPA. While WSPR did not cause the sub-surface condition that resulted in the potential for vapor intrusion, in order to protect the health of its employees and continue its business operations, it has nevertheless implemented corrective action measures to prevent vapor intrusion, such as sealing the floors of the building and conducting periodic air monitoring to address potential exposure.\nOn August 13, 2015, the EPA released its remedial investigation and feasibility study (\u201cRI/FS\u201d) for the Site. On December 11, 2015, the EPA issued the Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d) for an initial operable unit (a discrete action towards addressing problems at the Site), electing to implement its preferred remedy which consists of soil vapor extraction and dual-phase extraction/in-situ treatment. This selected remedy includes soil vapor extraction (\u201cSVE\u201d) to address soil (vadose zone) source areas at the Site, impermeable cover as necessary for the implementation of SVE, dual phase extraction in the shallow saprolite zone, and in-situ treatment as needed to address residual sources. The EPA\u2019s estimated capital cost for its selected remedy is $7.3 million. The EPA also designated a second operable unit under which the EPA has and will continue to conduct further investigations to determine the nature and extent of groundwater contamination, as well as a determination by the EPA on the necessity of any further response actions to address groundwater contamination. In February 2017, the EPA indicated that it planned to expand its field investigation for the RI/FS to a second operable unit to further determine the nature and extent of the groundwater contamination at and from the Site and to determine the nature of the remedial action needed to address the contamination. The EPA has requested access to the property occupied by WSPR to install monitoring wells and to undertake groundwater sampling as part of this expanded investigation. WSPR has consented to the EPA\u2019s access request, provided that the EPA receives PRIDCO\u2019s consent, as the property owner.\nIn December 2018, the Company, WSPR, and other identified Potentially Responsible Parties affiliated with the Site entered into tolling agreements to extend the statute of limitations for potential claims for the recovery of response costs for the initial operable unit under Section 107 of CERCLA. The tolling agreements do not constitute in any way an admission or acknowledgment of any fact, conclusion of law or liability by the parties to the agreements. WSPR never used the primary contaminant of concern and did not take up its tenancy at the Site until after the EPA had discovered the contamination in the local water supply. The EPA has also issued notices of potential liability to a number of other entities affiliated with the Site, which used the contaminants of concern.\nAccordingly, based on the above uncertainties and variables, it is not possible at this time for the Company to estimate its share of liability, if any, related to this matter. However, in the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and the impact on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations could be material. In addition, previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility or other properties that are currently or have formerly been owned, operated or used by the Company is discovered, the Company could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses. If this occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s executives and other key employees are critical to the Company\u2019s success. The loss of and/or failure to attract and maintain its highly skilled employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on the efforts and skills of its executives and other key employees. The Company\u2019s key employees are experienced and highly qualified in the housewares industry. The loss of any of the Company\u2019s executive officers or other key employees could harm the business and the Company\u2019s ability to timely achieve its strategic initiatives. The Company\u2019s success also depends, in part, on its ability to identify, hire and retain other skilled personnel. The Company\u2019s industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with successful track records. The Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so.\nUncertainties associated with the acquisition of Filament may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of Filament or the Company which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future business and operations following the acquisition.\nThe Company\u2019s success after the acquisition of Filament will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Filament or the Company. Current and prospective employees of Filament and the Company may experience uncertainty about their roles within the Company following the acquisition or other concerns regarding the Company\u2019s operations following the acquisition, any of which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees following the acquisition to the same extent that the Company has previously been able to attract or retain such employees.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Filament, Taylor Parent has significant influence over the Company and its interests may conflict with the Company\u2019s or its stockholders in the future.\nAs a result of the issuance of common stock to Taylor Parent, Taylor Parent has significant influence over the Company. Going forward, Taylor Parent\u2019s degree of control will depend on, among other things, its level of ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock and its ability to exercise certain rights under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement that the Company entered into with Taylor Parent in connection with the acquisition and merger agreement.\nUnder the Stockholders Agreement, for so long as Taylor Parent continues to beneficially own at least 50% of the shares it received at the consummation of the acquisition, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries may take any of the following actions without the approval of the directors designated by Taylor Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld: (i) enter into any agreement for a transaction that would result in a change of control of the Company; (ii) consummate any transaction for the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets; (iii) file for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11, or for liquidation pursuant to Chapter 7, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (iv) liquidate or dissolve the business and affairs of the Company; (v) take any Board of Directors action to seek an amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or approve, or recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders approve, an amendment to the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Bylaws, except as required by Delaware Law (as defined in the merger agreement) or other applicable law and other than amendments that would not materially and disproportionately affect Taylor Parent; (vi) incur additional debt in excess of $100 million in the aggregate, subject to certain exceptions; (vii) acquire or dispose of assets or a business, in each case with an individual value in excess of $100 million; (viii) terminate the employment of the Chief Executive Officer, other than for cause (in which case the Company shall consult in good faith with Taylor Parent on a replacement Chief Executive Officer); or (ix) adopt a stockholder rights plan that does not exempt as \u201cgrandfathered persons\u201d the stockholders party to the Stockholders Agreement and their affiliates from being deemed \u201cacquiring persons\u201d due to their beneficial ownership of the common stock of the Company upon the public announcement of adoption of such stockholder rights plan (it being understood that no such plan shall restrict any stockholder party to the Stockholders Agreement or its affiliates from acquiring, in the aggregate, common stock up to the level of their aggregate percentage beneficial ownership as of the public announcement of the adoption of such stockholder rights plan).\nAccordingly, Taylor Parent\u2019s influence over the Company and the consequences of such control could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and business prospects and negatively impact the trading price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 76686, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "LCUT"}
