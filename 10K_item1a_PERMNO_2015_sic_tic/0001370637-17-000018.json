{"cik": "1370637", "company": "ETSY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, our consolidated financial statements and related notes, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the other information in this Annual Report. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $29.9 million, $54.1 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $116.3 million. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we hire additional employees, increase our marketing efforts, expand our operations and continue to invest in the development of our platform, including our Seller Services and tools and technological enhancements. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses. In addition, our revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including those described in these Risk Factors.\nFurther, our revenue growth rate may continue to decelerate in the future for a number of reasons, including the gradual deceleration of our GMS growth rate. For further information about the rate of revenue and GMS growth, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Revenue.\u201d You should not rely on growth rates of prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results, as well as our key metrics, may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. These reasons include those described in these Risk Factors and the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in revenue generated from Etsy sellers on our platform, including as a result of the seasonality of market transactions and Etsy sellers\u2019 use of Seller Services;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour success in attracting and retaining Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers;\n\u2022\nour success in executing on our Markets and Seller Services strategies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new services and features we introduce;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our investment in marketing;\n\u2022\neconomic and market conditions, such as currency fluctuations and global events;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or defects in our markets, such as privacy or data security breaches or other incidents that impact the reliability of our platform;\n\u2022\nthe impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our existing business and future growth; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of our revised global corporate structure that was implemented on January 1, 2015.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems. For example, analysts or investors might change their\nmodels for valuing our common stock, we could experience short-term liquidity issues, our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise.\nIn addition, we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. For example, our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results. These seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time, which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nOur growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers.\nOur financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active sellers and active buyers. For example, our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers, seller engagement, the number of active buyers, buyer engagement and our ability to maintain trusted markets. We must continue to encourage Etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our Seller Services and encourage Etsy buyers to return and purchase items in our markets more frequently.\nWe want to create the best shopping experience for Etsy buyers and are focused on making enhancements that encourage purchase frequency. We believe that many new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers find Etsy.com by word of mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. If existing Etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform, they may stop listing items in our markets and using our Seller Services and may stop referring others to us. Likewise, if existing Etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing, whether because of a negative experience, lack of buyer-friendly features, declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by Etsy sellers or other factors, they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us. Under these circumstances, we may have difficulty attracting new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense.\nEven if we are able to attract new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to replace the ones that we lose, they may not maintain the same level of activity, and the revenue generated from new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers may not be as high as the revenue generated from the ones who leave our markets. If we are unable to retain existing Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and attract new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers who contribute to an active community, our growth prospects could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the demand for the goods listed in our markets is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures. If demand for the goods that Etsy sellers offer declines, we may not be able to attract and retain Etsy buyers and our business would be harmed. Trends in socially-conscious consumerism and buying locally could also shift or slow which would make it more difficult to attract new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue.\nThe trustworthiness of our markets and the connections within our community are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain them, our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers could suffer.\nWe have built trusted markets that embody our values-based culture. Our reputation depends upon our Etsy sellers, their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies. We establish trust in our markets in a variety of ways. For example, our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, Etsy Wholesale partners and production partners participating on our platform. We strive to give the Etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a small business that adheres to certain principles. Our Integrity team uses a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies. We also have sophisticated tools to detect fraud and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform. In addition, production partners who apply to join Etsy Manufacturing must commit to ethical expectations and to operating a safe and just workplace, with transparency and reliable customer service.\nEtsy's transparency with our community helps to support the trustworthiness of our markets. For example, we publish an annual Progress Report that details our progress toward our ideals and shares our goals for the years to come and we also release an annual Transparency Report, which, among other things, describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on our platform, or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights.\nWe also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among members of our community through our communication tools, seller stories on our website and our in-person events, which highlight personal relationships as a key part of the Etsy experience. For example, Etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories and use tools,\nsuch as shop videos, to reach Etsy buyers on our platform and on social media. We also recognize that sometimes transactions don\u2019t go as planned. When that happens, our Case System provides a way for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes.\nWe also encourage our employees to build meaningful connections with other members of our community. For example, we ask employees to perform support rotations to help foster connections with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs.\nThe trustworthiness of our markets and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business. Many things could undermine these cornerstones, such as:\n\u2022\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform or our policies and guidelines, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\n\u2022\nan inability to gain the trust of prospective buyers;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or defects in our markets, such as privacy or data security breaches or other incidents that impact the reliability of our platform;\n\u2022\nlack of awareness of our policies;\n\u2022\nchanges to our policies that members of our community perceive as inconsistent with our values or that are not clearly articulated;\n\u2022\na failure to enforce our policies effectively, fairly and transparently, including, for example, by allowing the widespread listing of prohibited items in our markets;\n\u2022\na failure to respond to feedback from our community; or\n\u2022\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values.\nIf we are unable to maintain trustworthy markets and encourage connections among members of our community, then our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected.\nAdherence to our values and our focus on our mission and long-term sustainability may negatively influence our short- or medium-term financial performance.\nOur values are integral to everything we do. Accordingly, we intend to focus on the long-term sustainability of our business and work toward our mission to reimagine commerce and expand the Etsy Economy. We may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and the Etsy Economy and, therefore, our stockholders over a longer period of time, even if those actions do not maximize short- or medium-term financial results. However, these longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may choose to prohibit the sale of items in our markets that we believe are inconsistent with our values even though we could benefit financially from the sale of those items;\n\u2022\nwe may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our community in the long term even though the changes may be perceived unfavorably; or\n\u2022\nwe may take actions, such as investing in alternative forms of shipping or locating our servers in low-impact data centers, that reduce our environmental footprint even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives.\nWe are a Certified B Corporation. The term \u201cCertified B Corporation\u201d does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. Our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our choice or by our failure to meet B Lab\u2019s certification requirements, if that change in status were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corporations. For example, since we do not intend to reorganize as a public benefit corporation\nunder Delaware law, our future status as a Certified B Corporation may be affected. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corporation score declines and that created a perception that we have slipped in our satisfaction of the Certified B Corporation standards. Similarly, our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with our values.\nIf we are not able to enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, our growth prospects may be harmed.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing customer demands. We spend substantial time and resources understanding the needs of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and responding to them. For example, we enhance our Seller Services, search and discovery functionality and the member experience on a regular basis. We also regularly launch new products and services. For example, in 2016, we launched a new Seller Service, Pattern, which enables Etsy sellers to create their own custom website. We also introduced a number of tools, such as Google Shopping, which allows sellers to reach audiences off of Etsy by advertising their listings in Google search results. In 2017, we plan to launch a new craft supplies market, Etsy Studio, to serve our craft supplies sellers and help them reach a broader audience of craft supplies buyers around the world. Our effectiveness in enhancing our current offerings and introducing new offerings may impact our revenue growth and our operating results.\nEtsy sellers and Etsy buyers may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs. In addition, developing new services and features is complex, and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. As a result, the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs, which may not be continued for various reasons. In addition, new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors, negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively.\nNew offerings may not drive increases in revenue, may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do.\nIf we do not continue to cost-effectively develop new offerings that satisfy Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed. In addition, new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing them.\nWe expect to continue to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective.\nMaintaining and promoting awareness of our markets and broader platform is important to our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. We believe that much of the historical growth in the number of active sellers and active buyers has originated from word-of-mouth referrals and other organic means, as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited, although increasing in recent years. We launched our first brand marketing campaign in 2016, and intend to invest significant resources in marketing in the future, particularly brand marketing focused on bringing more Etsy buyers to our platform and encouraging existing buyers to return more frequently. We anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as we continue to invest in our marketing efforts and as competition increases, and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult.\nAn important part of our markets strategy is to position Etsy's markets as go-to shopping destinations for unique items that buyers can use in their everyday lives. Our growth will depend in part on our ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing Etsy buyers and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through revenue growth. If we are not able to change our brand perception and raise awareness of the breadth and depth of items available in our markets, our business could be adversely affected. The marketing efforts we implement may not succeed for a variety of reasons, including our inability to execute and implement our plans. External factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing, affiliate marketing and display advertising, as well as search engine optimization, social media usage, mobile push notifications and email. We obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user\u2019s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed, which can negatively affect the placement of links to our markets and, therefore, reduce the number of visits to our markets. The growing use of online ad-blocking software, including on mobile devices, may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more Etsy buyers to our platform. We also obtain a significant number of visits through email advertising. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, or if Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers do not open our emails, whether by choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam, or for other reasons, our business could be adversely affected. Social\nnetworking websites, such as Facebook and Pinterest, are another important source of visits to our markets. As online commerce and social networking evolve, we must continue to maintain a presence within these networks.\nIf the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our platform could decline.\nPurchases made on mobile devices by consumers, including Etsy buyers, have increased significantly in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing. Etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform. If we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, Etsy sellers\u2019 ability to manage and scale their businesses may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer. Further, although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device, we depend on Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers using our mobile apps for the optimal mobile experience. Visits to our markets through a mobile website may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through our mobile app or through desktop, which could result in less revenue for us. Additionally, although conversion rates have continued to increase across mobile websites, mobile apps and desktop, these rates may slow or stall, which could also have a negative impact on revenue.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources.\nThe success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as:\n\u2022\nactions taken by providers of mobile operating systems or mobile app download stores;\n\u2022\nunfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to distribute or use our mobile apps; or\n\u2022\nchanges in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive products.\nIf Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices, or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected.\nExpanding our community outside of the United States is an important part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed.\nOur vision is global and local and we are focused on expanding outside of the United States. Although we have a significant number of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers outside of the United States, we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the United States and may not execute our strategy successfully. Operating outside of the United States also requires significant management attention, including managing and staffing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, and adapting our platform to local markets.\nDespite our execution efforts, the goods that Etsy sellers list on Etsy.com may not appeal to non-U.S. consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the United States. In addition, non-U.S. buyers are not as familiar with the Etsy brand as buyers in the United States and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy. Also, visits to Etsy.com from Etsy buyers outside the United States may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the United States, including due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that a majority of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our success outside the United States will be linked to our ability to attract local Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to our markets. If we are not able to expand outside of the United States successfully, our growth prospects could be harmed. An inability to develop Etsy's community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the United States on a cost-effective basis could adversely affect our GMS, revenue and operating results.\nCompetition is also likely to intensify outside of the United States, both where we operate now and where we plan to expand our operations. Local companies based outside the United States may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, their local markets. Some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will.\nContinued expansion outside of the United States may also require significant financial investment. These investments include marketing , enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language, forming relationships with third-party service providers, supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the United States and integrating those companies with our operations. Our investment outside of the United States may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses.\nFurther expansion outside of the United States will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad.\nDoing business outside of the United States subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as:\n\u2022\ncomplying with different (and sometimes conflicting) laws and regulatory standards (particularly including those related to the use and disclosure of personal information, online payments, intellectual property, consumer protection, online platform liability and taxation of goods and services);\n\u2022\nfluctuations of foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotentially heightened risk of fraudulent transactions;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and export control laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, trade controls and sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nvarying levels of internet, e-commerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce contracts and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States; and\n\u2022\nbarriers to international trade, such as tariffs, customs or other taxes.\nEtsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders. Even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders, if Etsy sellers are not, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the United States and cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets.\nOur payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations.\nEtsy buyers primarily pay for purchases using Direct Checkout or PayPal. In the United States and other countries where Direct Checkout is available, Etsy buyers can use Direct Checkout on our platform to pay with credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, PayPal and, in certain markets, Apple Pay, Android Pay and Etsy Gift Cards, rather than being directed to a third-party payment platform. A significant portion of our GMS, approximately 78%, is processed through Direct Checkout, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from Direct Checkout.\nWe have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying compliance, card processing and payment disbursing, currency exchange, identity verification and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate, Etsy sellers\u2019 ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. For example, third-party service providers may experience service outages from time to time that impact Etsy. In July 2016, a third-party payment processor experienced a technical issue that caused payment processing delays and complications for purchases through Direct Checkout, which required Etsy to develop a short-term manual solution. These payment processing delays and complications did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. If a third-party payment processor has significant outages in the future and we do not have alternative payment processors in place or are unable to provide our own solution, our business could be harmed. In addition, if our third-party providers increase the fees they charge us, our operating expenses could increase. If we respond by increasing the fees we charge to Etsy sellers, some Etsy sellers may stop using Direct Checkout, stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether.\nThe laws and regulations related to payments are complex, evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities or could force us to stop offering Direct Checkout. Additionally, changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments system less profitable. For example, any significant change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, may negatively impact Direct Checkout.\nAs we expand the availability of Direct Checkout or offer new payment methods to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements.\nFurther, through our agreements with our third-party payment processors, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are subject to change. Failure to comply with these rules and certification requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our third-party payment processors and could result in potential fines. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. In addition, similar to a potential increase in costs from third-party providers described above, any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules could lead to increased fees for Etsy or Etsy sellers, which may negatively impact Direct Checkout usage and our markets.\nOur business could be adversely affected by economic downturns, natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other unexpected events.\nMacroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business. If general economic conditions deteriorate in the United States or other markets where we operate, consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available in our platform may be reduced. This would cause sales in our markets and Seller Services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if recent trends supporting self-employment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse, the number of Etsy sellers offering their goods in our markets could decline and the number of goods listed in our markets could decline. In addition, we believe that currency exchange rates are dampening the demand from buyers outside the United States for goods denominated in U.S. dollars, which is impacting our GMS. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 88% of our GMS was denominated in U.S. dollars.\nNatural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions, public health crises, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability or other unexpected events, could disrupt our operations, internet or mobile networks, or the operations of one or more of our third-party service providers. For example, when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, our headquarters in Brooklyn was closed for five days, and we experienced a heavy volume of support requests from Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, which required us to devote additional resources to handle those requests. Events of this type could impact Etsy sellers\u2019 ability to continue producing goods for sale in our markets. These events may also impact consumer perceptions of well-being and security, which may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending. If any of these events occurs, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf sensitive information about members of our community is misused or disclosed, or if we or our third-party providers are subject to cyber attacks, members of our community may curtail use of our platform, we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer.\nLike all online services, our platform is vulnerable to power outages, telecommunications failures and catastrophic events, as well as computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of our members' personal or financial information. Cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property. As we gain greater public visibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks. Although we rely on a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our third-party service providers.\nAdditionally, some of our third party service providers, such as identify verification and payment processing providers, regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive member data. If these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices, or experience a breach of their networks, our members' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\nCyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our third-party service providers\u2019 services have occurred regularly in the past, and we expect they will continue to occur in the future. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us. Existing Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers may stop listing new items for sale, decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential liability, regulatory investigation, costly remediation efforts and litigation, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted markets.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. To be successful, we need to attract and retain both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. As a result, we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors.\nWe compete for Etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses. In addition to listing her goods for sale on Etsy, an Etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers, such as Amazon, eBay or Alibaba, or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces, including through commerce channels on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our markets or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform, such as Square, Intuit and Shopify.\nWe compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy sellers based on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour brand awareness;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our Seller Services can ease the administrative tasks that an Etsy seller might encounter in running her business, wherever she chooses to pursue commerce;\n\u2022\nthe global scale of our markets and the breadth of our online presence;\n\u2022\nthe number and engagement of Etsy buyers;\n\u2022\nour seller education resources and tools;\n\u2022\nour policies and fees;\n\u2022\nthe ability to scale her business through Pattern, Etsy Wholesale or Etsy Manufacturing;\n\u2022\nour mobile apps;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our community; and\n\u2022\nour values.\nIn addition, we compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay or Alibaba, or national retail chains, such as West Elm or Target, or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. Many of these competitors offer low-cost or free shipping, fast shipping times, favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for Etsy sellers to match.\nWe compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy buyers based on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe breadth of unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our markets;\n\u2022\nour brand awareness;\n\u2022\nthe person-to-person commerce experience;\n\u2022\nour reputation for trustworthiness;\n\u2022\nour mobile apps;\n\u2022\nease of payment; and\n\u2022\nthe availability and reliability of our platform.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources, better name recognition or more customers than we do.\nThey may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do, and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do. Further, our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services, causing Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services. Additionally, we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship.\nLocal companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the United States may also have a better understanding of local customs, providing them a competitive advantage. For example, in certain markets outside the United States, we compete with smaller, but similar, local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors\u2019 actions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on Etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to Etsy buyers.\nA small portion of Etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform. For example, Etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased, that the items received were not as represented by an Etsy seller or that an Etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions.\nAlthough our Case System provides a way for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes, negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers or damage our reputation. A perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are inadequate could have similar results. In some situations, we may choose to reimburse Etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation, but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements.\nAnything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to Etsy buyers could harm Etsy sellers. Service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of Etsy sellers, such as interruptions in order or payment processing, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, inclement weather, terrorism, public health crises or political unrest. Disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of Etsy sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of Etsy buyers, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur reputation may be harmed if members of our community use illegal or unethical business practices.\nOur emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by Etsy sellers or other members of our community. Our policies promote legal and ethical business practices, such as encouraging Etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor, who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions. However, we do not control Etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies. If members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so, we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed.\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\nAlthough we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our markets, those measures may not always be effective.\nFor example, Etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data. Under current credit card practices, we could be held liable for orders placed through Direct Checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent\ntransactions, we may not be able to do so effectively. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. We could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our markets.\nNegative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and damage our reputation.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks.\nEtsy sellers and Etsy buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our markets. Internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access. Mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps.\nInternet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform. In 2015, rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission went into effect that prohibit internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain \u201cfast traffic\u201d lanes; however, the rules are subject to pending legal challenges and if they are overturned, or if the current Federal Communications Commission revokes or changes the rules, our business could be adversely impacted. Outside of the United States, government regulation of the internet, including the idea of network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. As a result, we could face discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and Etsy sellers\u2019 growth prospects, increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform.\nThe reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. As the number of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, volume of traffic, number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. The operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability. The investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our business and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce profitability in the near term.\nWe also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products.\nThird-party providers host much of our technology infrastructure. Any disruption in their services, or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our markets could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide. If we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully, then our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers could be adversely affected, which could harm our growth prospects and our business.\nOur ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success.\nWe strive to attract, retain and motivate employees, from our office administrators to our management team, who share our dedication to our community and our mission. As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the employees we need to maintain our competitive position.\nSome of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include:\n\u2022\npreserving our company culture as we grow;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to attract and retain employees who share our values;\n\u2022\npromoting existing employees into leadership positions to help sustain and grow our culture;\n\u2022\nhiring employees in multiple locations globally;\n\u2022\nresponding to competitive pressures and changing business conditions in ways that do not divert us from our values; and\n\u2022\nintegrating new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nOur ability to attract, retain and motivate employees, including our management team, is important to our success. In general, our employees, including our management team, work for us on an at-will basis. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees, such as our CEO or CFO, could adversely affect our business. Other companies, including our competitors, may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms.\nFilling engineering, product management and other technical positions in the New York City area is particularly challenging, especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture. Qualified individuals are limited and in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract, develop and motivate them. Even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits, people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we are not able to maintain our engineering culture and broader company culture, then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed.\nThe growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our business, such as in headcount, the number of Etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future, both in the United States and abroad. For example, our headcount has grown from 251 employees on December 31, 2011 to 1,043 employees on December 31, 2016. The growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure. For example, we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures. As we continue to grow, our operating expenses will increase. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed.\nWe may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses, which may divert management\u2019s attention and/or prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. For example, in September 2016 we acquired Blackbird Technologies, Inc. Acquisitions may divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. Acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash, issue stock, incur debt or other liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur write-offs of goodwill or other assets. In addition, integrating an acquired business or technology is risky. Completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with:\n\u2022\nintegrating new businesses and technologies into our infrastructure;\n\u2022\nconsolidating operational and administrative functions;\n\u2022\ncoordinating outreach to our community;\n\u2022\nmaintaining morale and culture and retaining and integrating key employees;\n\u2022\nmaintaining or developing controls, procedures and policies (including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures); and\n\u2022\nassuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before and after the acquisition, including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, cyber attacks, taxes and other matters.\nMoreover, we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect, or in the time frame we expect. We also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition, which could cause dilution to our stockholders. Finally, acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts, investors or the members of our community.\nOur business is subject to a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. laws, many of which are evolving.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and around the world, including those relating to traditional businesses, such as employment laws and taxation, and laws and regulations focused on internet service providers and online commerce, such as online payments, privacy, anti-spam, data security and protection, online platform liability, intellectual property and consumer protection. In light of our international operations, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-corruption and export control laws. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort.\nAdditionally, it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by internet service providers or online commerce. For example, laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions. Federal, state and non-U.S. governmental authorities, as well as courts interpreting the laws, continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements relating to the use of third-party \u201ccookies,\u201d \u201cweb beacons\u201d and other methods of online tracking. The United States, the European Union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could (i) significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools and (ii) require internet service providers to disclose user information to regulatory authorities.\nSome providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or have announced plans to implement, ways to block tracking technologies which, if widely adopted, could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective. Any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of Etsy buyers, increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on cost-effective terms. As a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn some cases, non-U.S. privacy, data security and protection, consumer protection, e-commerce and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States and are actively enforced. For example, the European Union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations and provided for more onerous penalties under such laws than the United States. Consequently, the expansion of our operations internationally may require changes to the ways we display, collect and use consumer information and may necessitate unfavorable product changes for our non-U.S. users.\nExisting and future laws and regulations enacted by federal, state or non-U.S. governments could impede the growth of internet service providers or online commerce. It is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform. If we are restricted from operating in one or more countries, our ability to attract and retain Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, but they may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties, our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services, which could negatively affect our business.\nAdditionally, if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies, those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that items listed in our markets are counterfeit, infringing or illegal.\nAlthough we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our markets by Etsy sellers, we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our markets infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. We have intellectual property complaint and take-down procedures in place to address these communications, and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our markets. We follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action, which may include removal of the item from our markets and, in certain cases, closing the shops of Etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies.\nOur procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability. In particular, we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by Etsy sellers on our platform, especially outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Under current U.S. copyright law and the Communications Decency Act, we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on\nour platform by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. However, trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions, and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions. These safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably. In that event, we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of Etsy sellers.\nRegardless of the validity of any claims made against us, we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them. If a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by Etsy sellers on our platform, we could face regulatory, civil or criminal penalties. Successful claims by third-party rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items. These types of claims could force us to modify our business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our costs or make our platform less user-friendly. Moreover, public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our markets, even if factually incorrect, could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nCompanies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or misused others\u2019 intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third-parties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters.\nIn addition, some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights in one or more jurisdictions where Etsy does business. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business.\nWe may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming.\nIn addition to intellectual property claims, we may become involved in other litigation matters, including class action lawsuits. For example, as described further in \u201cNote 14-Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming Etsy and certain of our officers and/or directors as defendants. Under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors, officers and underwriters, in connection with the litigation described in this Annual Report and in connection with any future lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately.\nOur intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. To establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. We generally do not elect to register our copyrights, relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property, which may not be sufficient. We rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks, which may not always be comprehensive in scope. In addition, our copyrights and trademarks, whether or not registered, and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged, and may be of limited territorial reach. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. To\nthe extent we do seek patent protection, any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies.\nIn addition, we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. The legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world, and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our intellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed.\nOur software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u201ccontinuous deployment,\u201d meaning that we typically release software code many times per day. This practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of our community members, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business.\nWe are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software.\nThe software powering our markets incorporates software covered by open source licenses. In addition, we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and we anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses relied upon by Etsy and the internet and technology industries generally have not been interpreted by U.S. courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our markets. Under certain open source licenses, if certain conditions were met, we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses. To avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. In addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, while we may benefit from the contributions of others, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and our Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, provincial taxes, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours and to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers is a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to Etsy sellers\u2019 businesses. One or more states, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet, and are considering related legislation. New legislation could require us or Etsy sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, remittance and audit requirements, which could make selling in our markets less attractive and could adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments, which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits. At any one time, multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions, changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business.\nIn January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the United States. Our new corporate structure changed how we use our intellectual property and implemented certain intercompany arrangements. We believe this may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate over the long term and other operational efficiencies; however, the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation, and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure. Moreover, these tax laws are subject to change. Tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons, we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business.\nOur insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities, such as general liability, property coverage, errors and omissions liability, employment liability, business interruptions, data breaches, crime, product liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability. For certain types of business risk, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums and/or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any claims that we make.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, our management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The rules and regulations of Nasdaq also apply to us. As part of these requirements, we have established and maintained effective disclosure and financial controls and made changes to our corporate governance practices. We expect that continued compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nMost of our management and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings. In addition, our management and other personnel divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company. In particular, we have incurred significant expense and devoted substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. It also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although our management has determined, and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2016, we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control in the future.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, it could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our SEC reporting obligations or Nasdaq listing requirements , adversely affect our reputation, cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements. Further, if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls, such as Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nThe terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nWe do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility. However, our credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as:\n\u2022\ndisposing of assets;\n\u2022\ncompleting mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nencumbering our properties or assets;\n\u2022\npaying dividends or making other distributions;\n\u2022\nmaking specified investments; and\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately. Such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments. Moreover, any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may need additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments, such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue. We may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Borrowing funds would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit our operations. It is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation.\nThe price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. For example, since January 1, 2016, our common stock's daily closing price on Nasdaq has ranged from a low of $6.36 to a high of $15.81 through February 24, 2017. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons, many of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results and other financial and operational metrics, including the key financial and operating metrics disclosed in this Annual Report, as well as how those results and metrics compare to analyst and investor expectations;\n\u2022\nforward-looking statements related to our financial guidance or projections, our failure to meet or exceed our financial guidance or projections or changes in our financial guidance or projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock or a negative view of our financial guidance or projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new services or enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements or other developments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of mergers or acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors, management or other key personnel;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our markets due to hardware, software or network problems, security breaches or other issues;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the global economy or the economy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, currency fluctuations, and market conditions in our industry and those affecting members of our community;\n\u2022\nthe trading activity of our largest stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock that are available for public trading;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims against us;\n\u2022\nstockholder activism;\n\u2022\nthe performance of the equity markets in general and in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe operating performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in legal requirements relating to our business; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in this Annual Report.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. Stock prices of many technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. For example, as described further in \u201cNote 14-Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming Etsy and certain of our officers and/or directors as defendants. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price. Any securities litigation, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf analysts do not publish research about our business, or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock, so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility. As a result, stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity in the future. We also issue common stock to our employees, directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws;\n\u2022\nrestrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our\nmanagement. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 of the DGCL imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 15291, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ETSY"}
