{"cik": "754673", "company": "SUFFOLK BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s results may be adversely affected if it suffers higher than expected losses on its loans or is required to increase its allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk from the possibility that it will suffer losses because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties fail to perform under the terms of their loans. Management tries to minimize and monitor this risk by adopting and implementing what management believes are effective underwriting and credit policies and procedures, including how the Company establishes and reviews the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is determined by continuous analysis of the loan portfolio and the analytical process is regularly reviewed and adjustments may be made based on the assessments of internal and external influences on credit quality. Those policies and procedures may still not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results. Weak economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of collateral securing those loans. In addition, deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in regulation and regulatory interpretation and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. (See also Part II, Item 7, Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses and Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for further discussion related to our loan portfolio and our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.)\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and its operations and income may be affected adversely by changes in laws and regulations governing its operations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Company may engage. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, limit growth rates, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or growth prospects. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nRecent financial reforms and related regulations may affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. For a description of the Dodd-Frank Act see Part I, Item 1. Business, Supervision and Regulation contained in this Form 10-K. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations will impact the Company\u2019s business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations have resulted in and will likely continue to result in additional costs and these additional costs may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nAs a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its banking subsidiary, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends upon the results of operations of the Bank and its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to limits imposed by law and regulation.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s activities are conducted through the Bank, and the Company receives substantially all of its funds (other than the net proceeds of any capital raising transactions that the Company may undertake) through dividends from the Bank. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its stockholders.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is income that remains after deducting from total income generated by earning assets the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets. Income from earning assets includes income from loans, investment securities and short-term investments. The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors including the volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of the change in interest rates and the levels of non-performing loans. The cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets, the rates paid to attract and hold deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, at different times, to changes in market interest rates. Management expects that the Company will periodically experience gaps in the interest-rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Management is unable to predict changes in market interest rates which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other governmental monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets. Net interest income is not only affected by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve, relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates, as well as balance sheet growth, client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables.\nManagement attempts to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate-sensitive assets and interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Management reviews the Company's interest rate risk position and modifies its strategies based on projections to minimize the impact of future interest rate changes. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with taxation that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe amount of income taxes the Company is required to pay on its earnings is based on federal, state and city laws and regulations. The Company provides for current and deferred taxes in its financial statements, based on its results of operations, business activity, legal structure, interpretation of tax statutes, assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit and application of financial accounting standards. The Company may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain. The Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority assesses additional taxes that have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its anticipated effective tax rate either due to a change in tax law, a change in regulatory or judicial guidance or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits. The new tax provisions of New York State Article 9A allow banking corporations to exclude from income 160% of the dividends it has received from subsidiaries such as a REIT, which is now included in the mandatory combined group. Going forward, the Company may not realize the benefits of the exclusion from income of 160% of the dividends received from the REIT, if the bank\u2019s assets were in excess of $8 billion, resulting in a higher effective state income tax rate. The occurrence of any of these tax-related risks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the economy, as well as competition from other banks. Changing economic conditions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and increase the credit risk of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s primary market area includes Suffolk County, Nassau County and New York City. Adverse economic conditions in that market area could reduce the Company\u2019s rate of growth, affect customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and result in higher levels of loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the values of the collateral (including residential and commercial real estate) securing the Company\u2019s loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, competition in the banking industry is intense and the Company\u2019s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio has a high concentration of commercial real estate loans (inclusive of multifamily and mixed use commercial loans) and its business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with commercial real estate and a decline in property values.\nAt December 31, 2015, $1.2 billion, or 72% of the Company\u2019s total gross loan portfolio, was comprised of commercial real estate (inclusive of multifamily and mixed use commercial loans). This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Although real estate prices have shown signs of improvement, a decline in real estate values may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase the risk that the Company would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nThe Company expects to depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of deposits as the primary source of funding for its lending activities. The Company\u2019s future growth will largely depend on its ability to maintain a strong core deposit base. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which would increase the Company\u2019s funding costs. If deposit clients move money out of bank deposits and into other investments (or into similar products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), the Company could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in reduced loan originations, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to significant operational risks that could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions and breaches of internal control systems. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through its outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nA failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in financial losses or in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including client information.\nAs a financial institution, the Company may be the target of fraudulent activity that may result in financial losses to the Company and its clients, privacy breaches against its clients or damage to its reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, unauthorized intrusion into or use of the Company\u2019s systems and other dishonest acts. The Company provides its customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. The Company\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of cybersecurity breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or viruses. Given the volume of Internet transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent cybersecurity breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject the\nCompany to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage. The Company\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and the Company\u2019s plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to its customers.\nThe Company depends on its key employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success will, to some extent, depend on the continued employment of its executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on the Company\u2019s business. No assurance can be given that these individuals will continue to be employed by the Company. The loss of any of these individuals could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity risk could impair the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the banking industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against the Company. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking or financial services industries.\nThe Company may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nThe Company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. At some point, the Company may need to raise additional capital. If the Company raises additional capital, it may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, its common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to new stockholders would be dilutive to the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and cause significant reputational harm to the Company.\nThe Company is subject to litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly regulated nature of the banking industry. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the large or indeterminate damages that may be sought, there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability the Company may incur from litigation matters. Substantial liability against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, making it difficult to resell shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at times and prices that stockholders may find attractive.\nThe Company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future. The market value of the Company\u2019s common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, as well as the other risk factors described herein:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating and financial results;\n\u2022 developments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022 dispositions, acquisitions and financings;\n\u2022 actions of the Company\u2019s current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory developments; and\n\u2022 developments related to the financial services industry.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in volatility in the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, the Company\u2019s common stock and sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the Company\u2019s operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSubject to the limitations under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the number of shares of the Company\u2019s authorized capital stock, the Company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the Company of a large number of shares of common stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of New York and federal laws and regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, despite the possible benefit to its stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions include the election of directors to staggered terms of three years, advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings and the requirement that directors fill vacancies on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. In addition, the BHC Act, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either regulatory approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the appropriate regulatory agencies and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring control of a national bank, such as the Bank. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 75509, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SCNB"}
