The following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur business is entirely dependent on the success of STAR-0215 as a potential treatment for HAE, a program that is in preclinical development.\nOur business is entirely dependent on the success of STAR-0215, which is in the preclinical stage of development, and has only produced results in preclinical and nonclinical settings. We acquired STAR-0215 in connection with our acquisition of Quellis in January 2021. We cannot give any assurance that we will generate clinical or other data for STAR-0215 sufficiently supportive to receive regulatory approval, which will be required before it can be commercialized. We have not filed an IND with the FDA for STAR-0215. We may experience issues surrounding preliminary trial execution, such as delays in filing our planned IND, delays in FDA acceptance of our planned IND, delays in filings with other regulatory authorities, include potential CTA filings in the EU, feedback from FDA and other EU regulatory authorities on our Phase 1b/2 trial design, revisions in our Phase 1a and Phase 1b/2 trial designs, and finalization of trial protocols, difficulties with patient recruitment and enrollment, quality and provision of materials and supplies necessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of drug product to meet our clinical trial needs on a timely basis, or early safety signals. STAR-0215 will require significant preclinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales.\nUntil late 2020, we were largely focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs by applying our SMART Linker drug discovery platform. With the acquisition of Quellis, we shifted our focus to STAR-0215. Unlike our prior product candidates, which were small molecules, STAR-0215 is a humanized monoclonal antibody. As a result, we face different regulatory, manufacturing, and research and discovery requirements and demands.\nThe success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of STAR-0215, which may never occur. Given that STAR-0215 is in preclinical development, it will be years before we are able to demonstrate safety and efficacy of STAR-0215 sufficient to warrant approval for commercialization, and we may never be able to do so. If we are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize STAR-0215, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business and our business would be materially harmed.\nPreclinical development is uncertain. Our preclinical programs may experience delays or may never advance to clinical trials and we may be unsuccessful in identifying any new product candidates.\nOur lead product candidate, STAR-0215, is still in the preclinical stage, and its risk of failure is high. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies that support our planned IND in the United States, or similar applications in other jurisdictions, including CTA submissions in the EU. Such studies are complex and may be subject to delays or increased costs due to our dependence upon third parties to assist us with such studies and the ability to source raw materials and the appropriate animals, including non-human primates, so that we can conduct such testing. In the event that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to complete additional preclinical studies or we are required to satisfy other FDA requests or other requests of comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to commencing clinical trials, the start of our planned clinical trials may be delayed or take longer to complete. Even after we receive and incorporate guidance from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such authorities may not agree that we have satisfied their requirements to commence any clinical trial or change their position on the acceptability of our trial design or the clinical endpoints selected, which may require us to complete additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or impose stricter approval conditions than we currently expect. We cannot be certain of\nthe timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing and studies will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications, including CTA submissions in the EU, will result in the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin or that we can meet the requirements imposed by such authorities for beginning such trials on a timely basis or at all.\nIn addition, any future research programs to identify new product candidates will require substantial technical, financial and human resources, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to identify new product candidates. If we are unable to identify suitable additional compounds for preclinical and clinical development, our ability to develop product candidates and obtain product revenues in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in preclinical studies or early development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, or any future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in preclinical studies or clinical trials of STAR-0215 or any other future product candidate, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for such product candidate, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe have limited financial and managerial resources and are focused on the preclinical and clinical development of STAR-0215 as a potential treatment for HAE, a rare disease with unmet medical need. We would expect that development of any other future product candidate would also be for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of both their potential for marketing approval and commercialization. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on STAR-0215 and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. If clinical trials of a product candidate fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulators, we, or any future collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidates.\nWe, and any future collaborators, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining approval from the FDA of a BLA, which would be required for approval of STAR-0215, or NDA. Comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, require similar approvals. We, and any future collaborators, may never receive such approvals. We, and any future collaborators, must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of any product candidate that we may choose to develop before we, or they, will be able to obtain these approvals.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials we initiate will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, or at all. In addition, in the case of STAR-0215, for which we are designing our clinical studies with the goal of demonstrating that it can be dosed in HAE patients every three months or longer, clinical trials will necessarily be longer given the length of time between doses in the trials. Further, the clinical development of product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure at any stage of drug development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. It is possible that even if a product candidate that we choose to develop has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in any clinical trials we conduct, we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by a product candidate, or mistakenly believe that a product candidate is toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case.\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates. Moreover, our prior programs were not biologics and this lack of experience may impede our ability to successfully complete clinical development of STAR-0215 or any future biologic product candidates we pursue and obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, if at all. Any inability to complete clinical development successfully could result in additional costs to us, or any future collaborators, and impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. Moreover, if (1) we, or any future collaborators, are required to modify our trial designs, such as required modifications with respect to patient populations, endpoints, comparators or trial duration, (2) we, or any future collaborators, are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of a product candidate beyond the trials and testing that we, or they contemplate, (3) we, or any future collaborators, are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of a product candidate or other testing, (4) the results of these trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable, or (5) there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with a product candidate, we, or any future collaborators, may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for such product candidate;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements, such as a REMS program; or\n\u25cf be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nGiven our early stage of development, it will be years before we are able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a treatment sufficient to warrant approval for commercialization, and we may never be able to do so. Our failure to successfully complete clinical\ntrials of a product candidate and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market any product candidate would significantly harm our business.\nAdverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, any future product candidate may be identified during development that could delay or prevent their marketing approval or limit their use.\nAdverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, any future product candidate could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of such product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any such product candidate is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nIf we, or any future collaborators, experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of any future product candidate, potential marketing approval or commercialization of such product candidate could be delayed or prevented.\nWe, or any future collaborators, may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent marketing approval or commercialization of any future product candidate, including:\n\u25cf clinical trials may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may decide, or regulators may require us or them, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate, particularly with respect to STAR-0215, which is being developed as a potential treatment for HAE, an indication which has a significant number of approved products and products in clinical development, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate;\n\u25cf the cost of planned clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors or those of any future collaborators, including those manufacturing such product candidate or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf or on behalf of any future collaborators, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us or any future collaborators in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any future collaborators or our or their investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u25cf patients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial\u2019s duration;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may have to delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate, or travel bans or other restrictions imposed by applicable governmental authorities due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may require that we, or any future collaborators, or our or their investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar drug or drug candidate;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree or subsequently find fault with our, or any future collaborators\u2019, clinical trial designs or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we, or any future collaborators, enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply, due to, among other things, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.\nIn addition, we are planning to conduct clinical trials outside of the United States, which are subject to the risks set forth above, and certain additional risks, such as unforeseen global instability, including political instability or geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, natural disasters or instability from an outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in or around any countries in which we conduct clinical trials. Such additional risks could affect our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials in these countries, prevent patients already enrolled from completing such clinical trials, and/or cause other trial delays or otherwise adversely impact such clinical trials.\nProduct development costs for us, or any future collaborators, will increase if we, or they, experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals and we, or they, may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of any future product candidate. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we, or any future collaborators, may have the exclusive right to commercialize product candidates or allow our competitors, or the competitors of any future collaborators, to bring products to market before we, or any future collaborators, do and impair our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to successfully commercialize product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any future product candidates.\nIf we, or any future collaborators, experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our or their receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe, or any future collaborators, may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for STAR-0215 or any other future product candidate if we, or they, are unable to locate and enroll, and maintain the enrollment of, a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials as required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and is affected by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for the trial;\n\u25cf the design of the clinical trial;\n\u25cf efforts to facilitate timely enrollment;\n\u25cf competing clinical trials; and\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any existing or newly approved drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nOur ability to successfully complete any future clinical trial for STAR-0215 as a potential treatment for HAE or for any other future product candidate for the potential treatment of any rare disease or any other indication will be dependent upon our ability to enroll, and maintain the enrollment of, a sufficient number of patients with such disease, which will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, rare diseases, including HAE, have small patient populations and often have only a limited number of specialist physicians that regularly treat such patients. Further, these specialized sites typically treat a range of diseases and, at any point in time, may have constrained resources and capacity to handle clinical trials. In addition, in the case of HAE, the indication on which we are currently focused, approved products are available for the rare disease, and additional products may become commercially available during the STAR-0215 clinical development, and therefore patients and their healthcare providers may feel satisfied with their treatments. As a result, patients may not feel the need to participate in a clinical trial for another product candidate for the same disease or the criteria for the trial may not allow patients on such other therapies to enroll in the trial. Additionally, in the case of HAE, diagnosis is often delayed from onset of symptoms and patients that might be eligible for enrollment in our trials may not have been diagnosed and therefore are unaware of such eligibility. Finally, other companies are and will be conducting clinical trials in HAE or may have announced plans for future clinical trials for HAE that are seeking, or are likely to seek, to enroll patients with the disease and patients are generally only able to enroll in a single trial at a time. The small population of patients, competition for these patients and the limited trial sites and their constrained resources may make it difficult for us to enroll enough patients, and to maintain the enrollment of enough patients, to complete clinical trials for any such future product candidate.\nThe clinical trials that we may conduct may also have inclusion criteria that further limit the population of patients that we are able to enroll. These inclusion criteria could further limit the available patient pool and present challenges to clinical trial enrollment.\nOur inability, or the inability of any future collaborators, to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any clinical trials, including potential clinical trials for STAR-0215 as a potential treatment for HAE, that we or they may determine to pursue could result in significant delays or may require us or them to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in any such clinical trials may result in increased development costs for the applicable product candidates, delay or halt the development of and approval processes for any future product candidates and jeopardize our, or any future collaborators\u2019, ability to commence sales of and generate revenues from any future product candidates, which could cause the value of our company to decline.\nBusiness disruptions could delay completion of future clinical trials, seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of third-party research institution collaborators, contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing operations, and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we may be partly uninsured, as well as impacts of geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), terrorist activity and unstable governments and legal systems. In addition, to the extent we determine to pursue development of future product candidates, we expect that we will rely on third-party research institution collaborators for conducting research and development of such product candidates, and they may be affected by government shutdowns or withdrawn funding. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could delay completion of any clinical trials for such product candidates, seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, significant impacts worldwide, and may delay the initiation of future clinical trials, disrupt or increase the costs of regulatory or manufacturing activities, or have other adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, this ongoing pandemic has adversely impacted economies worldwide and may disrupt the financial markets, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations and ability to raise capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, significant impacts worldwide causing many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny, and other measures. The outbreak and government measures taken in response, including widespread emergency orders requiring business and residents to curtail non-essential activities, have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The development of STAR-0215 or any other future product candidates could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for a variety of reasons, including delays of the initiation, recruitment and overall timing of clinical trials, delays at FDA and other regulatory authorities, who have been diverting resources to help address the pandemic since its inception and are likely to continue to do so, the disruption or delays of regulatory or manufacturing activities, including due to facility shut downs, capacity constraints at third party manufacturers due to the focus on vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, and increased costs or the inability to source key raw materials that are being diverted for COVID-19 efforts, or other adverse effects that negatively impact our business or operations. The future progression and unpredictability of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are highly uncertain and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the widespread use and distribution of the vaccines, the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, additional surges in the number of cases or deaths from COVID-19, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nThe pandemic also caused an initial significant disruption in the financial markets, and may cause future such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds through public offerings and may also impact the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Moreover, it is possible the pandemic will continue to significantly impact economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business and it has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approval for any future product candidate we may seek to develop.\nWe have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate. We have not yet succeeded and may never succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety for any of our product candidates in a Phase 3 clinical trial or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. For example, although we discovered and evaluated numerous compounds using our SMART Linker drug discovery platform, no product created using the SMART Linker drug discovery platform was ever approved for sale.\nIf we are able to advance STAR-0215 or any other future product candidate into late-stage development, it is possible that the FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign regulatory authority may refuse to accept for substantive review any applications that we submit for marketing approval of such product candidates or may conclude after review of our data that our applications are insufficient to obtain marketing approval of such product candidate. If the FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept or approve any applications that we submit for marketing approval, they may require that we conduct additional clinical or nonclinical studies, or conduct manufacturing validation studies, and submit that data before they will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other required studies, approval of any application that we submit may be delayed by several years or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign regulatory authority.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent us from commercializing STAR-0215 or any future product candidate, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for any future product candidates, which could significantly harm our business.\nIf any future product candidate receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability, or that of any future collaborators, to market the drug could be compromised.\nClinical trials of product candidates are conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that clinical trials for STAR-0215 and any other future product candidate, or those of any future collaborator, may indicate an apparent positive effect of such product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the drug or seize the drug;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to recall the drug, change the way the drug is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular drug;\n\u25cf we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf we may become the subject of government investigations, which would be expensive to manage and potentially result in the imposition of fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf the drug may become less competitive; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\nEven if STAR-0215 or any future product candidate receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity for the product candidate may be smaller than we estimate.\nEven if STAR-0215 or any future product candidate of ours is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies.\nEfforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of future product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If STAR-0215 or any other future product candidate of ours is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market\nacceptance of STAR-0215 or any other future product candidates of ours, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u25cf the potential advantages of the product compared to existing approved treatments or alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy and whether there is an existing standard of care;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf the product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u25cf the strength of sales, marketing, market access and distribution support;\n\u25cf the approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf availability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u25cf adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u25cf potential product liability claims.\nThe potential market opportunities for product candidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Any estimates we make as to the potential market opportunities for STAR-0215 or any future product candidates of ours will be predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. These assumptions will involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, will be inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions may not have been assessed by an independent source. If any such assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the actual markets for any such future product candidate could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing any future product candidates that we may develop if and when those product candidates are approved.\nWe currently do not have a formal sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we would need to either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We expect to use a combination of focused in-house sales and marketing capabilities and third-party collaboration, licensing and distribution arrangements to sell any products that receive marketing approval.\nWe generally expect that we would seek to retain full commercialization rights for products that we can commercialize with a specialized sales force and to retain co-promotion or similar rights when feasible in indications requiring a larger commercial\ninfrastructure. The development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities will require substantial resources, will be time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we could have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization costs. This may be costly, and our investment could be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. In addition, we may not be able to hire or retain a sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we plan to target. If we are unable to establish or retain a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, at such time as we need to, our operating results may be adversely affected. If a potential partner has development or commercialization expertise that we believe is particularly relevant to a product, then we may seek to collaborate with that potential partner even if we believe we could otherwise develop and commercialize the product independently.\nWe may collaborate with third parties for commercialization of any products that require a large sales, marketing and product distribution infrastructure. We intend to potentially commercialize product candidates through collaboration, licensing and distribution arrangements with third parties. As a result of entering into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues may be lower, perhaps substantially lower, than if we were to directly market and sell products in those markets. Furthermore, we may be unsuccessful in entering into the necessary arrangements with third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may have little or no control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing any product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nWe face substantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our operating results may suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We expect that we, and any future collaborators, will face significant competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to any product candidates that we, or they, may seek to develop or commercialize in the future.\nWe are developing STAR-0215 for the potential treatment of HAE. The key competitive factors affecting the success of STAR-0215, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nIn the United States, the FDA has approved four therapies for on-demand treatment of HAE: BERINERT, FIRAZYR, KALBITOR and RUCONEST. For long-term preventative treatment of HAE, the FDA has also approved four therapies: CINRYZE, HAEGARDA, TAKHZYRO and ORLADEYO. There are four main manufacturers of therapies for HAE: CSL Behring (BERINERT and HAEGARDA), Takeda (FIRAZYR, KALBITOR, CINRYZE and TAKHZYRO), Pharming (RUCONEST) and BioCryst (ORLADEYO). With the exception of KALBITOR, these therapies are also approved and commercially available outside of the United States (HAEGARDA is marketed as BERINERT SC outside of the United States). Historically, androgens and antifibrinolytic treatments have also been used as preventative treatment for HAE, however their use is declining with the availability of more-tolerable, HAE-specific therapies.\nOn-demand and preventative HAE therapies target one of three primary mechanisms. BERINERT and HAEGARDA, RUCONEST and CINRYZE are C1 INH replacement therapies. FIRAZYR is a Bradykinin 2 receptor antagonist, and KALBITOR, TAKHZYRO and ORLADEYO target plasma kallikrein. TAKHZYRO is a monoclonal antibody and KALBITOR and ORLADEYO are small molecule inhibitors.\nOn-demand therapies are taken as needed; BERINERT and RUCONEST are IV infusions approved for adult and pediatric patients, FIRAZYR is a SC injection, approved for adults 18 and older, and KALBITOR is a series of 3 SC injections, approved for patients 12 years and older. KALBITOR must be administered by a healthcare professional to monitor for the risk of anaphylactic reactions.\nPreventative therapies are taken chronically. CINRYZE is an IV infusion and HAEGARDA is an SC injection; both are administered twice a week and are approved for adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older. TAKHZYRO is an SC injection generally administered every two weeks; however dosing every four weeks may be considered in some patients. TAKHZYRO is approved for patients 12 years and older.\nORLADEYO is an oral capsule taken once daily with food for patients 12 years and older. Given that TAKHZYRO is an approved monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, if STAR-0215 is approved, we expect that it will compete most directly with TAKHZYRO.\nWe are aware of additional programs in development for HAE, which are focused largely on preventative approaches. For example, in Phase 3 development for preventative treatment are CSL Behring garadacimab (CSL312), a factor XIIa-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (FXIIa mAb), and Ionis Pharmaceuticals\u2019 donidalorsen (IONIS-PKK-LRx), an antisense inhibitor of prekallikrein synthesis. KalVista Pharmaceuticals has two oral small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors: sebetralstat (KVD900) for on-demand treatment of HAE, and KVD824 for preventative treatment, both of which are in Phase 2 development. Pharvaris is also developing two oral treatments, PHVS416, in Phase 2 for on-demand treatment, and PHVS719, in Phase 1 for preventative treatment, that are small molecule inhibitors of B2R. Intellia has begun Phase 1/2 trials for NTLA-2002, a CRISPR knockout of the prekallikrein gene KLKB1. BioMarin has begun Phase 1/2 trials for BMN 311, a C1INH gene therapy. In preclinical development for preventative treatment are KalVista\u2019s oral FXIIa inhibitor, Spark Therapeutics C1-INH gene therapy (SPK-10000), Regenxbio\u2019s plasma kallikrein mAb gene therapy, and Orchard Therapeutics and Pharming\u2019s ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (OTL-105).\nThe enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials for STAR-0215 may be disrupted or delayed as a result of clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of STAR-0215 in relation to commercially available therapies and other programs in development, including approved products as well as any other new products that may be approved in the future for the treatment of HAE.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, have fewer or more tolerable side effects or are less costly than any product candidates that we may develop, which could render any future product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we, or any future collaborators, may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other marketing approval for their products before we, or any future collaborators, are able to obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we, or any future collaborators, are able to enter the market.\nOur potential future competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nSTAR-0215 and any other future biologic product candidates will be regulated as biological products, or biologics, and therefore they may be subject to competition from biologic products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biologic product.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable with\u201d based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. In addition, the licensure of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still develop and receive approval of a competing biologic, so long as its BLA does not rely on the reference product, the sponsor\u2019s data or submit the application as a biosimilar application. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty, and any new policies or processes adopted by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that STAR-0215 and any of our future product candidates, we develop as a biologic product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider subject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nNonetheless, the approval of biosimilars to our product candidates, would have a material adverse impact on our business due to increased competition and pricing pressures.\nIf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any future products that receive marketing approval through the NDA pathway, or such authorities do not grant such products appropriate periods of data exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, our sales could be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201creference-listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference-listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference-listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference-listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference-listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference-listed drug is typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference-listed drug has expired. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference-listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference-listed drug.\nGeneric drug manufacturers may seek to launch generic products following the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period we obtain if our products are approved, even if we still have patent protection for such products. Competition that any such products of ours may face from generic versions of such products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. We will face an even greater risk if we or any future collaborators commercially sell any product that we may or they may develop. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of any future product candidates. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any future product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend resulting litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance of $5.0 million in the aggregate and clinical trial liability insurance of $10.0 million in the aggregate, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities that we may incur. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. We will need to increase our insurance coverage if and when we begin selling any product candidate that receives marketing approval. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of any future product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We are continuing to conduct preclinical and nonclinical studies, and ramp up manufacturing of clinical supplies, of STAR-0215, and plan to initiate Phase 1a clinical trial in the second half of 2022 and a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in 2023, and expect that our expenses will increase substantially as a result. In addition, we may in the future initiate new research, preclinical and clinical development efforts, and seek marketing approval, for other product candidates, and would expect our expenses to increase in connection with each of these activities. If we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we may incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of a future collaborator, and these activities would require substantial additional funding. In addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of our product candidates, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for any of our product candidates on suitable terms or at all. In any event, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development of any of our product candidates. Furthermore, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAccordingly, we will be required to obtain substantial additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. We do not have any committed external source of funds. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, on a timely basis or at all, impacting our ability to execute on our strategic plans. Our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms as and when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future efforts to seek approval for and commercialize products, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to support operating expenses through 2023. Our estimate as to how long we expect our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to be able to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to meet our overall timing expectations for STAR-0215;\n\u25cf the progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research, preclinical and clinical development, and manufacturing efforts for, STAR-0215 any future product candidates, including potential future clinical trials and all activities necessary to initiate and conduct clinical trials;\n\u25cf our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any additional collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf the number and characteristics of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;\n\u25cf the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, market access, distribution, supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, and scaling up the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product to clinical and commercial scale, securing all raw materials necessary to conduct such scale-up and successfully completing all other activities related thereto;\n\u25cf subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates;\n\u25cf if we obtain marketing approval of any of our products, our ability to successfully compete against other approved products that are approved or used as treatments for the indications for which our products are approved, including with respect to STAR-0215 in HAE;\n\u25cf our headcount growth and associated costs;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims;\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, business and prospects; and\n\u25cf the costs of operating as a public company.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses for at least the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur net losses were $194.9 million (including $164.4 million of in-process research and development expenses) and $37.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $455.8 million. We have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of preferred stock before we became a public company and our private placement of preferred stock in the February 2021 Financing, registered offerings of our common stock, and our at-the-market programs, and have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical development programs. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses and we may incur increased expenses if and to the extent we:\n\u25cf initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for STAR-0215 and any future product candidates;\n\u25cf seek to identify and develop any future product candidates;\n\u25cf seek regulatory and marketing approvals for STAR-0215 and any future product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials, in the United States and other markets;\n\u25cf establish sales, marketing, market access, distribution, supply chain and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any;\n\u25cf require the manufacture of larger quantities of STAR-0215 and any other future product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf hire and retain additional personnel or add information systems, equipment or physical infrastructure to support our operations.\nTo become and remain profitable, we or any potential future collaborators must develop and eventually commercialize at least one product candidate with significant market potential. This will require that we or our collaborators be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of one or more product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for one or more these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we or our collaborators may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We or our collaborators may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we or our collaborators do succeed, we or our collaborators may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company also could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in us.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to develop and commercialize STAR-0215 or to acquire, develop and commercialize any future product candidates or to pursue other strategic options. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests may be substantially diluted, and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Quellis and our February 2021 Financing, we issued an aggregate of 86,077 shares of Series X, of which 53,532 shares of Series X Preferred Stock automatically converted into 8,921,966 shares of our common stock upon the stockholder approval of the conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock into common stock in June 2021 and an additional 1,090 shares have subsequently converted into 181,698 shares of common stock. The remaining 31,455 shares of Series X Preferred Stock are convertible into 5,242,501 shares of common stock at the election of the holders thereof, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. In addition, our June 2018 and February 2019 registered offerings of common stock and common stock warrants and our January 2020 registered offering of common stock were highly dilutive to existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests. Further, exercise of the common stock warrants sold in our June 2018 and February 2019 offerings, and the warrants that we assumed in the acquisition of Quellis, could result in additional dilution upon exercise.\nDebt financing, if available, would result in periodic payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, creating liens, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, securing additional financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to oversee the development of any future product candidate.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution, licensing or royalty arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe may seek to establish collaborations and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nThe development and commercialization of product candidates require substantial cash to fund expenses. We may seek one or more collaborators for the development and commercialization of STAR-0215 or any future product candidates. Likely collaborators may include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies.\nCollaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. Further, there have been a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. In addition, any collaboration agreements that we enter into in the future may contain, restrictions on our ability to enter into potential collaborations or to otherwise develop specified compounds.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and strategic partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration or strategic partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the other party\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction and the proposed party\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the potential differentiation of ours or a partner\u2019s product candidate from competing product candidates, design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the regulatory pathway for any such approval, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the product to patients and the potential of competing products. The collaborator or strategic partner may also be considering alternative transaction types and structures that may be more attractive than the one with us.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop the product candidate or bring it to market and generate product revenue.\nIf we enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of a product candidate, our prospects with respect to such product candidate will depend in significant part on the success of those collaborations.\nIf we enter into collaborations for the development and commercialization of a product candidate, we will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators will dedicate to the development or commercialization of such product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on any future collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In addition, any future collaborators may have the right to abandon research or development projects and terminate applicable agreements, including funding obligations, prior to or upon the expiration of the agreed upon terms. Collaborations involving product candidates pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of a product candidate or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the market or competitive landscape, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in negative publicity for our product candidate and the need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nIn addition, all of the risks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section would apply to the activities of our collaborators. Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If any future collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination or a sale or other transaction involving our collaboration, it or the party with which it entered into a business combination, sale or other transaction could decide to delay, diminish or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If they do not perform satisfactorily, our business could be significantly harmed.\nWe do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of STAR-0215 or any future product candidates. We would expect to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials of any such product candidate. Any of these third parties could terminate its engagement with us under certain circumstances or encounter, for example, business challenges, such as a loss of business, the COVID-19 pandemic or the impacts of geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), or enter into transactions, such as business combinations, that temporarily or permanently impact the amount or type of resources that they are able or willing to devote to our engagement. We might not be able to enter into alternative arrangements or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays would likely occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our expected clinical development timelines and harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nFurther, our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities would limit our control over these activities, but we would remain responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards. For example, notwithstanding the obligations of a CRO for a trial of a product candidate, we would remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and most other comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, clinical trial sites and institutional review boards. If we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving a product candidate, which would delay the marketing approval process. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. Many of these risks are heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also required to register clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Other regions, including the EU, have similar requirements. The failure to comply with these registration and posting requirements can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, the third parties that may conduct clinical trials on our behalf would not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such contractors, we would not be able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time, skill and resources to our development programs, a risk that could be exacerbated during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as any such third parties try to address the impact of the ongoing pandemic on their own businesses and financial condition. Any such contractors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for the applicable product candidates. If that occurs, we would not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize such product candidates. In such an event, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidates that we seek to develop could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for any future clinical trials we may pursue. Any performance failure on the part of any such distributors or impacts from geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorist activity and unstable governments and legal systems could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any future product candidates or commercialization of any resulting products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nThe manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and, in particular, biologics, is complex and we do not have our own clinical manufacturing capabilities. We will rely on third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates.\nWe currently have no manufacturing facilities and plan to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our preclinical product candidate supplies and clinical trial product supplies. We do not own, nor do we plan to own, any manufacturing facilities. There can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development product supplies from third parties will not be limited or interrupted, or be of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. Additionally, the process of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and, in particular, biologics is complex, highly regulated, and subject to multiple risks. Manufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, other supply disruptions and higher costs. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered at the facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials, result in higher costs of drug product and adversely affect our business.\nIf the contract manufacturers we engage are unable to supply us with sufficient clinical grade quantities of our product candidates, and we are unable to timely establish an alternate supply from one or more third-party contract manufacturers, we will experience delays in our development efforts as we seek to locate and qualify new manufacturers. In particular, any replacement of our third-party contract manufacturers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements or capacity could be limited at each of the qualified replacements. We expect to obtain drug product and drug substance from single third-party contract manufacturers, which exacerbates these and other related risks for us. Additionally, contract manufacturers may rely on single source suppliers for certain of the raw materials for our preclinical and clinical product supplies. If current or future suppliers are delayed or unable to supply sufficient raw materials to manufacture product for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may experience delays in our development efforts as materials are obtained or we locate and qualify new raw material manufacturers.\nThe manufacturing process for a clinical candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with their standards, such as cGMPs. In the event that any of our manufacturers fail to comply with such requirements or to perform their obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third-party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. The transfer of the manufacturing of biologic products to a new contract manufacturer and any additional process development that may be necessary can be lengthy and involve significant additional costs. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer would negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\nFurther, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risks beyond our control, including the:\n\u25cf inability to meet our drug specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u25cf inability to initiate or continue preclinical studies or clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\u25cf delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf manufacturing and drug quality issues, including related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u25cf failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u25cf reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, potentially single sources for drug components and raw materials, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these drug components and raw materials, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our future product candidate in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u25cf lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components and raw materials that are purchased from a sole or single source supplier;\n\u25cf inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u25cf disruption of operations by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier, the issuance of an FDA Form 483 notice or warning letter or geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorist activity and unstable governments and legal systems;\n\u25cf carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control;\n\u25cf failure to deliver our drugs under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nSome of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production, any of which could result in a failure to begin our clinical trials or having to stop ongoing clinical trials. In addition, our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of waste products, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for such third parties. Based on the severity of the regulatory action, our clinical or commercial supply of drug and packaging and other services could be interrupted or limited, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers are or may be engaged with other companies to supply and manufacture materials or products for such companies, which also exposes our suppliers and manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may also affect the regulatory clearance of a contract supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s facility, which could impact the contract supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s ability to manufacture for us.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize such product candidates successfully may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to STAR-0215 and any future product candidates. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. To protect our proprietary position, we have filed an International (PCT) patent application directed to STAR-0215 and intend to file patent applications in the United States and abroad related to STAR-0215 and future novel product candidates and related technologies that are important to our business. The patent application and approval process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Failure to protect or to obtain, maintain or extend adequate patent and other intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and product candidates. The enforcement, defense and maintenance of such patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenging and costly.\nWe cannot be certain that any patent application directed to STAR-0215 or any future product candidate will be issued in a form that provides us with adequate protection to prevent competitors from developing competing products. As a biopharmaceutical company, our patent position is uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards applied by USPTO, and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biopharmaceutical patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from any applications that are currently pending or that we file in the future. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have for STAR-0215 and its use. The scope of patent protection that the USPTO and foreign patent offices will grant with respect to STAR-0215 is uncertain. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. For example, it is possible that the USPTO and foreign patent offices will not allow broad antibody claims that specifically cover our STAR-0215 product candidate and antibodies closely related to it. As a result, upon receipt of FDA approval, or regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, competitors may be free to market antibodies almost identical to ours, including biosimilar antibodies, thereby decreasing our market share. However, a competitor cannot submit to the FDA an application for a biosimilar product based on STAR-0215 or any future biologic products until four years following the date of approval of our \u201creference product,\u201d and the FDA may not approve such a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled \u201cBusiness\u2009-\u2009Government Regulation and Product Approval\u2009-\u2009Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity\u201d for more details regarding biosimilar regulatory exclusivities.\nOur pending International patent application and any future patent applications we file cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, patents are granted to the party who was the first to file a patent application. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, patents were granted to the party who was the first to invent the claimed subject matter. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nMoreover, because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, our patents or pending patent applications may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in post-grant review procedures, oppositions, derivations, reexaminations, inter partes review or interference proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing antibodies or compounds similar or identical to our product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nPatent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect any current and future product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation\nof the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does.\nEven if patent applications that we file issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may also seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with any of our future products. Alternatively, our competitors may seek to market biosimilar versions of any approved products by submitting an application for a biosimilar product under the BPCIA. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, or both, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid or unenforceable, or that our competitors are competing in a non-infringing manner. Thus, even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar non-United States legislation for extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited duration. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest United States non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates, their manufacture, or use are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents, if issued, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, or under similar legislation in other countries. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner than we expect. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially.\nOur development and commercialization rights to STAR-0215 and future product candidates and technology may be subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe may become reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are relevant to our STAR-0215 product candidate and possible future product candidates. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we choose to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses.\nSuch license agreements would likely impose various development obligations, payment of royalties and fees based on achieving certain milestones, as well as other obligations. In addition, our licensors, in the future, may allege that we have materially breached our obligations under a certain license agreement and may therefore terminate that license agreement. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. The termination of any such license agreements or failure to adequately protect such license agreements could prevent us from commercializing product candidates covered by the licensed intellectual property. Furthermore, our competitors may obtain the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market products competitive with ours.\nDisputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under any collaboration relationships we might enter into in the future;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the ownership of inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nAn intellectual property litigation could lead to unfavorable publicity that could harm our reputation and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDuring the course of any patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our products, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. In such event, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing current and future product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and STAR-0215, as well as any future product candidates, without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. If any third-party patents or patent applications are found to cover STAR-0215 or any future product candidates or their methods of use, we may not be free to manufacture or market such product candidates as planned without obtaining a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn spite of our efforts to avoid obstacles and disruptions arising from third-party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our programs directed to STAR-0215 and any future product candidates will be free of claims by third-party intellectual property holders. Even with modern databases and on-line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, patent litigation may be initiated against us. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our technology platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biopharmaceutical industry, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to STAR-0215 or any future product candidates, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The biopharmaceutical industry has produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that any current or future product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing any future product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nOur involvement in litigation, and in, e.g., any interference, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, opposition or post-grant proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings in the United States, or other jurisdictions, may divert management time from focusing on business operations, could cause us to spend significant amounts of money and may have no guarantee of success. Any current and potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf stop selling, manufacturing or using our products in the United States or other jurisdictions that use the subject intellectual property;\n\u25cf obtain from a third party asserting its intellectual property rights, a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or may be non-exclusive thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us;\n\u25cf redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign could be technically infeasible; or\n\u25cf pay damages, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nAlong with patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, certain aspects of our manufacturing processes. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, CROs, advisors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants.\nTrade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to maintain as confidential. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, any party with whom we have executed a confidentiality agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches, despite any legal action that we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures. In addition, courts outside the United States sometimes are less willing than United States courts to protect trade secrets.\nIf any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nThose with whom we collaborate on research and development related to current and future product candidates may have rights to publish data and other information to which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research relevant to our business. The ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to certain contractual limitations. These contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our confidential information. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication, or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nChanges to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law in September 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act included a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents, for example, via post grant review and inter partes review proceedings at the USPTO. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act transformed the United States patent system into a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective in March 2013. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our inventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Additionally, there have been proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the Congress, the United States courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf others may be able to make antibodies that are the same as or similar to STAR-0215 or future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of patents that we own or have rights to;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or any current or future strategic partners might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by our pending patent application;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf it is possible that our pending patent rights will not lead to issued patents, or that patents, if granted, may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf third parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our products or technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional technologies that are patentable; and\n\u25cf third parties may allege that our development and commercialization of STAR-0215 or future products may infringe their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering any future product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWe may obtain only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patent rights, which may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions and prevent us from enforcing our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Accordingly, we may not file for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national/regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant patent offices, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.\nThe requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents or where any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nMoreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by changes in foreign intellectual property laws. Additionally, laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including India, China and other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities in those jurisdictions is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our products, we may not be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an\nagreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any future collaborators from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of STAR-0215 or any future product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which territories, we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product candidate.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, promotion and distribution of biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. We, and any future collaborators, are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States or in other countries until we, or they, receive approval of a BLA from the FDA, which would be required for approval of STAR-0215, or NDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside the United States. Product candidates in the development phase are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. We have not submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates in the United States or in any other jurisdiction. We have no experience as a company in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party clinical research organizations to assist us in this process.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information, including manufacturing information, to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nIn addition, changes in or the enactment or promulgation of additional statutes, regulations or guidance during preclinical or clinical development, or comparable changes in the regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we, or any future collaborators, ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could negatively affect our ability or that of any future collaborators to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad. Any approval we may be granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions and any of our product candidates that may be approved for marketing in a foreign jurisdiction will be subject to risks associated with foreign operations.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We, and any future collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may file for marketing approvals but not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nIn many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must also be approved for reimbursement before it can be sold in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. Obtaining non-United States regulatory approvals and compliance with non-United States regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. In addition, if we fail to obtain the non-United States approvals required to market our product candidates outside the United States or if we fail to comply with applicable non-United States regulatory requirements, our target markets will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and prospects may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom as a result of the 2020 withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom and European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement in connection with Brexit that sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the consequences of Brexit the impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom remains unclear. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law of the body of European Union law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for any product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business, or prevent us from commercializing any product candidate in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe expect that we will be subject to additional risks in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval outside the United States, including tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia); compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States.\nWe, or any future collaborators, may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or orphan drug exclusivity for any future product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. We, or any future collaborators, may seek orphan drug designations and may be unable to obtain such designations.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we, or they, may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for that product candidate. Generally, a product with orphan drug designation only becomes entitled to orphan drug exclusivity if it receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, in which case the FDA or the EMA will be precluded from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that indication for the applicable exclusivity period. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because FDA has taken the position that, under certain circumstances, another drug with the same active moiety can be approved for the same condition. Specifically, the FDA\u2019s regulations provide that it can approve another drug with the\nsame active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nIn 2017, the Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, which among other things, codified the FDA\u2019s pre-existing regulatory interpretation to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA.\nThe FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. This may be particularly true in light of a decision from the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in September 2021 finding that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term \u201csame disease or condition\u201d means the designated \u201crare disease or condition\u201d and could not be interpreted by the Agency to mean the \u201cindication or use.\u201d Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the \u201cindication or use.\u201d We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, to obtain orphan drug designation in the European Union, we would need to demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. There is no assurance that we would be able to meet that standard for STAR-0215 or any other product candidate. In particular, there is no assurance that STAR-0225 will be able to show, to the satisfaction of European Union regulatory authorities, that it of significant benefit to HAE patients given the currently available commercial products for HAE in the European Union and the additional products that are ahead of STAR-0215 in clinical development for HAE.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval would remain subject to ongoing regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, when and if any of our product candidates are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. In addition, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Accordingly, if we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. In September 2021 the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the FDA will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on distribution or use of a product;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products;\n\u25cf damage to relationships with collaborators;\n\u25cf unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u25cf litigation involving patients using our products.\nNon-compliance with European Union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Further, the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union, notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and are also subject to European Union Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the European Union.\nAccordingly, assuming we, or any future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and any future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we, and any future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, our or any future collaborators\u2019 ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may seek certain designations for our product candidates, including Breakthrough Therapy, RMAT Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review designations in the U.S., and PRIME Designation in the European Union, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the FDA. A Breakthrough Therapy and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, product is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For products that have been designated as Breakthrough and RMAT therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\nThe FDA may also designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product\u2019s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective.\nWe may also seek a priority review designation for one or more of our product candidates. If the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months.\nThese designations are within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for these designations, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Further, even if we receive a designation, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for these designations, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nIn the European Union, we may seek PRIME designation for some of our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a voluntary program aimed at enhancing the EMA\u2019s role to reinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development and enable accelerated assessment of new medicines that are of major public health interest with the potential to address unmet medical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target conditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European Union or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to medicines under development and not authorized in the European Union and the applicant intends to apply for an initial marketing authorization application through the centralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a product candidate must meet the eligibility criteria in respect of its major public health interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of substantiating the claims. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use rapporteur to provide continued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review, meaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability to be issued earlier in the application process. PRIME enables an applicant to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment advice to facilitate timely market access. Even if we receive PRIME designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation does not assure or increase the likelihood of EMA\u2019s grant of a marketing authorization.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements, which could materially harm our business.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of product candidates for clinical trials or commercial sale, including any contract manufacturers, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and\nprocedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing.\nWe or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA or NDA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA\u2019s current Good Laboratory Practice and cGMP regulations enforced through its facilities inspection program. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our contract manufacturers must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of any product candidate. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of the products will not be granted.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our contract manufacturers. If any such inspection or audit identifies failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility, which may lead to temporary or permanent supply shortages. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. Any such consequence would severely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies\u2019 operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies, including government agencies and regulatory authorities outside the United States, on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 2020 when foreign and domestic inspections of facilities were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume routine surveillance, bioresearch monitoring and pre-approval inspections on a prioritized basis. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. As of May 2021, certain inspections, such as foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical, remain temporarily postponed. In April 2021 the FDA issued guidance for industry formally announcing plans to employ remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates and in May 2021 announced plans to continue progress toward resuming standard operational levels. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the\nFDA does not determine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter or defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed.\nIn 2020 and 2021 a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. As of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain reimbursement for any of our product candidates that do receive marketing approval.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope, our business could be materially harmed.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. Pursuant to subsequent legislation, however, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.\nSince enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, in December 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case and in June 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe Trump Administration also took executive actions to delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden revoked those orders and issued a new executive order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans\u2019 access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine\nprotections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.\nWe expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are subject to considerable legislative and executive actions and could impact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent Congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020 President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries\u2019 access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to January 1, 2026 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2026.\nIn September 2021, acting pursuant to an executive order signed by President Biden, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit\nthe amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and the European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe may be subject to certain healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, curtailment or restricting of our operations, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, third-party payors and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers and third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Potentially applicable United States federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\nAnti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nFalse Claims Laws. The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\nHIPAA. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, also imposes obligations on certain types of individuals and entities, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nFalse Statements Statute. The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nTransparency Requirements. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the HHS information related to physician and healthcare provider payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests.\nAnalogous State and Foreign Laws. Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Many state laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances,\nmany of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in many circumstances.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, and reputational harm, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate or plan to operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the EEA in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States.\nAs a result, there is increased scrutiny on the extent to which clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply the GDPR to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data. Assisting parties with whom we exchange personal data in complying with the GDPR, or complying with the GDPR ourselves, may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices.\nSimilar initiatives are either in place or under way in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that are applicable to our activities, and a wide range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General all are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and federal levels. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR, though the Act does exempt certain information collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the Common Rule). Many other states are considering similar legislation. A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. There also is the threat of consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues\ntypically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with such requirements is rigorous and time intensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in the European Union. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to United States and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the United States Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third party intermediaries to promote our clinical research activities abroad and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations or other enforcement actions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Further, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could significantly harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we\ncannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur employees, independent contractors, CROs, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and principal investigators may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, CROs, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and, if we commence clinical trials, our principal investigators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in the European Union and other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the European Commission and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nSuch misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. Even with appropriate policies and procedures, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, are able to commercialize any product candidate that we, or they, develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party payor reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that could harm our business.\nThe commercial success of any future product that we may develop will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of such product will be paid by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health coverage insurers. If coverage and reimbursement is not available, or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we, or any future collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize such product. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or any future collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Many countries outside the United States, including many countries in the European Union, require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and can be lengthy, involve extensive negotiations and potentially result in price caps, significant discounts or other budgetary control measures, which could correspondingly impact pricing and reimbursement in other markets through so-called informal or formal reference pricing schemes. These reviews and negotiations could ultimately result in a pricing and reimbursement structure for a drug that a company deems inadequate and therefore\nelects not launch in such markets. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we, or any future collaborators, might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability or the ability of any future collaborators to recoup our or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if any future product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, our ability, and the ability of any future collaborators, to commercialize any product will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability or that of any future collaborators to sell any products we develop profitably. These payors may not view our products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or those of any future collaborators, or may not be sufficient to allow our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us, or any future collaborators, to decrease the price we, or they, might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the prices for any future products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. For example, to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we, or any future collaborators, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we, or any future collaborator, commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any product candidate for which we, or any future collaborator, obtain marketing approval could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us and our stockholders. Many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, the TCJA was enacted in 2017 and significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The TCJA, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, a limitation of the tax deduction for net interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and an elimination of net operating loss carrybacks (though any net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely), and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nAs part of Congress\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, or the FFCR Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, and COVID-19 relief provisions were included in the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 or CAA, which was enacted on December 27, 2020. All contain numerous tax provisions. In particular, the CARES Act, among other things, suspends the 80% limitation on the deduction for net operating losses in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, permits a 5-year carryback of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, and generally caps the limitation on the deduction for net interest expense at 50% of adjusted taxable income for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020.\nIt is also likely that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the changes in the U.S. presidential administration and control of the U.S. Senate, additional tax legislation may also be enacted. For example, President Biden has proposed to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate from its current 21%, implement a minimum tax on book income and increase taxation of international business operations, among numerous other corporate tax reform proposals. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in the combined company\u2019s or the combined company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 tax liability or require changes in the manner in which the combined company operates in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses or tax credits, or NOLs or credits, to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. As a result of the shares issued in January and February 2021 related to the acquisition of Quellis and the concurrent private placement of Series X Preferred Stock, we have likely experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382. If we have experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. We are planning to complete a study to confirm an ownership change occurred in 2021 and assess whether there have been multiple ownership changes since inception, as well as the resulting amount of the limitation on our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our NOLs or credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs or credits.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth and Information Technology\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and key employees.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers and key employees. If we are unable to retain our executive officers or other key employees, replacing them may be difficult and costly, and may take an extended period of time because of the nature of our current business strategy and the limited number of individuals in our industry with the relevant breadth of skills and experience. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate replacements for our executive officers or key employees on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.\nWe rely on consultants and advisors, including financial, legal, scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with those entities that may limit their availability to us.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems could compromise our information, disrupt our business and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, as well as our proprietary business information, employee data and personally identifiable information of clinical trial participants in accordance with informed consents covering such information. We also rely to a large extent on information technology systems to operate our business.\nWe have outsourced elements of our confidential information processing and information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology infrastructure, and that of our vendors and third-party providers, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We, our vendors and third-party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. While we have invested in information technology security measures and the protection of confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. For example, we have detected common types of attempts to attack our information technology systems and data using means that have included phishing. Any service interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems may substantially impair our ability to operate our business and could compromise our networks, or those of our vendors and third-party providers, and the information stored could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance of $1.0 million in the aggregate it may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own in excess of 20.0% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, acting together or on their own, may be able to impact matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to impact elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that investors may feel are in their best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with each investor\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. For example, when we announced our acquisition of Quellis, our stock price increased by approximately 70% in one day. In the twelve months ending February 28, 2022, the last business day in February, our stock price has traded at a high of $22.01 and a low of $3.83.\nThe stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our investors may lose some or all of their investments. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the timing and results of clinical trials of STAR-0215 or any future product candidate;\n\u25cf commencement or termination of collaborations for any development programs we may pursue;\n\u25cf failure or discontinuation of any of any development programs we may pursue;\n\u25cf the success of existing or new competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of product candidates of competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to a product candidate or clinical development program;\n\u25cf the results of any additional efforts to develop additional product candidates or products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results or recommendations by securities analysts that cover our stock;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf announcement of collaborations, licenses, acquisitions or other comparable forms of transactions;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions, including political instability, or instability from an outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAdditionally, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We expect that our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of SOX, we are required to furnish reports by our management on our internal control over financial reporting with our Annual Reports on Form 10-K with the SEC. If we cease to be a smaller reporting company with less than $100 million in annual revenue, we will also be required to include attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with SOX Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to\nassess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of SOX. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of February 28, 2022, we had outstanding 13,016,955 shares of common stock and 31,455 shares of our Series X Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 5,242,501 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to our obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of Quellis and the February 2015 Financing, we have registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, 15,399,967 shares of our common stock issued to the former Quellis stockholders or issued or issuable upon conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock. As a result, such shares are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any significant sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of February 28, 2022, we also had outstanding warrants to purchase 1,530,380 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $41,84 per share, with expiration dates between March 30, 2022 and December 14, 2030. We have registered the issuance of shares upon exercise of these warrants under registration statements. As a result, the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants can be freely sold in the public marked upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. Sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Furthermore, if our stock price rises, the holders of these warrants may be more likely to exercise their warrants and sell a large number of shares, which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and reduce or eliminate any appreciation in our stock price that might otherwise occur.\nAdditionally, we have an ongoing sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of common stock under an at-the-market offering program.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, accordingly, stockholders must rely on capital appreciation, if any, for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently plan to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation, development and growth of our business. Any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will likely depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our investors might otherwise receive a premium for\ntheir shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified board of directors such that all members of the board are not elected at one time;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call a special meeting of stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nIn addition, as of February 28, 2022, there are 31,455 shares of our Series X Preferred Stock outstanding that we issued in connection with the acquisition of Quellis and the February 2021 Financing. Except as otherwise required by law, the Series X Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. However, as long as any shares of Series X Preferred Stock are outstanding, we may not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series X Preferred Stock, (i) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series X Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation that authorized the Series X Preferred Stock, amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Series X Preferred Stock, (ii) issue further shares of Series X Preferred Stock or increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the number of authorized shares of Series X Preferred Stock, or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This could discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to our company or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or our certificate\nof incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, which provides for exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, that with respect to claims under the Securities Act, our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.", "PERMNO": 15416, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CATB"}
