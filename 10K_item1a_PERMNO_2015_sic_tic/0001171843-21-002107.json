{"cik": "806517", "company": "PSYCHEMEDICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Psychemedics Corporation and its business because such factors could have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. These risk factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nNational, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including but not limited to, quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. These measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant impact on financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and applicable government restrictions, and we have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and working from home. We have also limited our in-person interactions by our customer-facing professionals. This could negatively impact our ability to market our products effectively.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. A material disruption in our workplace as a result of COVID-19 could affect our ability to carry on our business operations in the ordinary course and may require additional cost and effort should employees not be able to physically on-premises.\nWe have incurred indebtedness under the Corona Aid, Relieve and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act which may be subject to audit, may not be forgivable and may eventually have to be repaid. Any repayment of such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us and may restrict our flexibility in operating business.\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a term loan with Bank of America N.A. (the \u201cCreditor\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) administered by the United States Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) under the CARES Act. The principal amount of the loan was $2.2 million (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d), which is evidenced by a promissory note with a maturity date of May 4, 2022, two years from the commencement date. The note bears interest on the unpaid balance of one percent (1%) per annum. The PPP Loan is subject to forgiveness under the PPP upon the Company\u2019s request to the extent that the proceeds are used to pay expenses permitted by the PPP, including payroll costs.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will conduct audits for PPP loans that exceed $2 million. Should we be audited by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or SBA as a result of the PPP Loan or filing an application for forgiveness, such audit or review could result in the diversion in management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur additional costs. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loan, in which event we may be required to finance repayment of the PPP Loan.\nOn November 6, 2020, the Company submitted an application for forgiveness of the entire amount due on the loan to the Creditor. The Creditor, in turn, accepted the application and issued a recommendation to the SBA on whether the Company is entitled to full, partial, or no forgiveness of the PPP Loan. While we believe we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, the Company cannot provide assurance that the principal and interest amounts under the PPP Loan will be forgiven. If all or substantially all of the PPP Loan is not forgiven or it is determined that it must be repaid, we may be required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal on the PPP Loan and interest.\nCompanies may develop products that compete with our products and some of these companies may be larger and better capitalized than we are.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and offer a range of products broader than our products. Some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future may develop more extensive research and marketing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than we do and may become better positioned to compete in an evolving industry. Inability to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability.\nOur business is intensely competitive, both in terms of price and service. Pricing of drug testing services is a significant factor often considered by customers in selecting a drug testing laboratory. As a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers can increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. The Company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. The Company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. Additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability. The Company operations in Brazil are subject to price pressures with new competitors entering the market. The Company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition.\nOur results of operations are subject in part to variation in our customers\u2019 hiring practices and other factors beyond our control.\nOur results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to variation in our customers\u2019 hiring practices and job creation, which in turn is dependent, to a large extent, on the general condition of the economy, especially within our major market segments. Results for a particular quarter may vary due to several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 economic conditions in our markets in general;\n\u2022 economic conditions affecting our customers and their particular industries;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022 pricing and other competitive conditions.\nA failure to obtain and retain new customers, or a loss of existing customers, or a reduction in tests ordered, could impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully grow its business.\nThe Company needs to obtain and retain new customers. In addition, a reduction in tests ordered, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability. We compete primarily based on the quality of testing, timeliness of results, reputation in the industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the Company\u2019s ability to expand its customer base.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our technology.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe or copy portions of our technology. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until either: (1) 18 months after the application filing date or (2) the publication date of an issued patent wherein applicant(s) seek only US patent protection, applications not yet disclosed may have been filed which relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States intellectual property laws. In the absence of the foregoing protections, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.\nOur business could be affected by IT system failures or Cybersecurity breaches.\nA computer or IT system failure could affect our ability to perform tests, report test results or properly bill customers for services performed. Failures could occur as a result of the standardization of our IT systems and other system conversions, telecommunications failures, malicious human acts (such as electronic break-ins or computer viruses) or natural disasters. Sustained system failures or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to process and provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. Failure of the Company\u2019s information systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, profitability and financial condition.\nOur technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity breaches. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, certain third parties to whom we outsource our services and functions, or with whom we interface, store our confidential patient data or other confidential information as also subject to the same IT risks. A breach or attack affecting these outsourced third parties could negatively impact our business.\nFailure to maintain confidential information could result in a significant financial impact.\nThe Company maintains confidential information regarding the results of drug tests and other information including credit card and payment information from our customers. The failure to protect this information could result in lawsuits, fines or penalties. Any loss of data or breach of confidentiality, such as through a computer security breach, could expose the Company to a financial liability.\nOur future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel.\nOur people are a critical resource. The loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business and prospects. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business. We do not have key personnel under contract other than 4 officers who have agreements providing for severance and non-compete covenants in the event of termination of employment following a change of control. Further, we do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel.\nThere is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from errors and omissions liability or other claims, or that in the future errors and omissions insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all.\nOur business involves the risk of claims of errors and omissions and other claims inherent to our business. We maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from all such possible claims. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our operating results or financial condition.\nOur research and development capabilities may not produce viable new services or products.\nIn order to remain competitive, we need to continually improve our products, develop new technologies to replace older technologies that have either become obsolete or for which patent protection is has expired. It is uncertain whether we will continually be able to develop services that are more efficient, effective or that are suitable for our customers. Our ability to create viable products or services depends on many factors, including the implementation of appropriate technologies, the development of effective new research tools, the complexity of the chemistry and biology, the lack of predictability in the scientific process and the performance and decision-making capabilities of our scientists. There is no guarantee that our research and development teams will be successful in developing improvements to our technology.\nImproved testing technologies, or the Company\u2019s customers using new technologies to perform their own tests, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAdvances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies that can be operated by third parties or customers themselves in their own offices, without requiring the services of a freestanding laboratory. Development of such technology and its use by the Company\u2019s customers could reduce the demand for its testing services and negatively impact our revenues.\nWe may not be able to recruit and retain the experienced scientists and management we need to compete in our industry.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientists and management. Our ability to achieve our business strategies depends on our ability to hire and retain high caliber scientists and other qualified experts. We compete with other testing companies, research companies and academic and research institutions to recruit personnel and face significant competition for qualified personnel. We may incur greater costs than anticipated, or may not be successful, in attracting new scientists or management or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel.\nOur future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, to manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable environment.\nOur facilities and practices may fail to comply with government regulations.\nOur testing facilities and processes must be operated in conformity with current government regulations. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may not be able to continue our services to certain customers, or we could be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of production, or withdrawal of our certifications. We operate a facility that we believe conforms to all applicable requirements. This facility and our testing practices are subject to periodic regulatory inspections to ensure compliance.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of any licenses.\nThe forensic laboratory testing industry is subject to significant regulation and many of these statutes and regulations are subject to change. The Company cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a regulatory authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. Potential sanctions for violation of these regulations could include the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, potential delays in renewals of licenses could also harm the Company.\nIf our use of chemical and hazardous materials violates applicable laws or regulations or causes personal injury we may be liable for damages.\nOur drug testing activities, including the analysis and synthesis of chemicals, involve the controlled use of chemicals, including flammable, combustible, and toxic materials that are potentially hazardous. Our use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and local fire codes, and regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Energy, and the California Department of Public Health and Environment. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future. In addition, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, which could result in material unanticipated expenses, such as substantial fines or penalties, remediation costs or damages, or the loss of a permit or other authorization to operate or engage in our business. Those expenses could exceed our net worth and limit our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur operations could be interrupted by damage to our laboratory facilities.\nOur operations are dependent upon the continued use of our laboratories and equipment in Culver City, California. Catastrophic events, including earthquakes, fires or explosions, could damage our laboratories, equipment, scientific data, work in progress or inventories of chemicals and may materially interrupt our business. We employ safety precautions in our laboratory activities in order to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of certain catastrophic events; however, we cannot eliminate the chance that such events will occur. Rebuilding our facilities could be time consuming and result in substantial delays in fulfilling our agreements with our customers. We maintain business interruption insurance to cover continuing expenses and lost revenue caused by such occurrences. However, this insurance does not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential harm to customer relations that our inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner could create.\nAgreements we have with our employees, consultants and customers may not afford adequate protection for our trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on copyright and trademark protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities. In an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Furthermore, we may from time to time hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities we conduct. In some situations, our confidentiality and proprietary information agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships. Although we require our employees and consultants to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information of their previous employers, these individuals, or we, may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations. Finally, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to compete effectively, or exclude certain competitors from the market.\nWe are subject to numerous political, legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.\nAlthough we conduct a majority of our business in the United States, a significant portion of our business is derived from Brazil. Our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include without limitation:\n\u2022 changes in the local economic environment or local laws or regulations\n\u2022 political instability, social changes, local market practices and changes\n\u2022 intellectual property legal protections and remedies\n\u2022 trade regulations\n\u2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u2022 attracting and retaining qualified employees and independent contractors including distributors\n\u2022 export and import and exchange controls\n\u2022 weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights\n\u2022 our reliance on one distributor in Brazil\nAs the Company previously disclosed, there are greater challenges and uncertainties in a new, large and developing market, such as Brazil. See Item 1. Business - Distribution, for discussion on the Company\u2019s Brazilian distributor.\nInternational operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures.\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nGlobal operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees or by intermediaries acting on our behalf may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and Brazil. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings, changes in our method of distribution in foreign countries, changes in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our Brazil-derived revenues, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5 - \"Income Taxes\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nWe currently have revenues from many countries, however, we are only subject to currency exchange risk related to the Brazilian Real. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur quarterly operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Our results are impacted by the extent to which we are able to gain new customers, both domestically and internationally, competitive pricing, and on the hiring practices of our existing customers, including seasonality. Demand for drug testing can be impacted by changes in government requirements regarding testing for drugs of abuse, delays in implementation of such requirements, as well as general economic conditions. Entering into new customer contracts can involve a long lead time. Accordingly, negotiation can be lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks, including customers\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal reviews. Due to these and other market factors, our operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to factors such as general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect the budgets and the hiring practices of our customers.\nDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our future performance. Our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If we do not meet analysts\u2019 and/or investors\u2019 expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur stock price could experience substantial volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience extensive volatility. Our quarterly operating results, the success or failure of future development efforts, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting our customers, our distributors, our competitors or us could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. This volatility may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in potential liabilities, substantial costs and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, regardless of whether we win or lose.\nNo assurance as to when we will resume paying dividends.\nFollowing the first quarter 2020, in connection with, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government programs adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended our quarterly dividend and have not yet reinstated it. Because the Company has historically paid dividends, the cessation of our quarterly dividend could negatively affect our stock price. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had paid dividends on our common stock for ninety-four consecutive quarters. We currently expect to pay quarterly dividends in the future, although such payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, government requirements and restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may consider at its discretion. In the absence of dividends, a return on investment in our common stock depends entirely upon future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nThe general economic condition could deteriorate.\nOur business is dependent upon new hiring and the supply of new jobs created by overall economic conditions. If the economy deteriorates, leading to a downturn in new job creation, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 11043, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "PMD"}
