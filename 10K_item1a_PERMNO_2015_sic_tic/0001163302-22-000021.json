{"cik": "1163302", "company": "UNITED STATES STEEL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nStrategic Risk Factors\nOur Investments in new technologies and products may not be fully successful.\nExecution of our Best for AllSM strategy depends, in part, on the success of a number of investments we have made and plan to make in new technologies and products. All of our investments are expected to drive stockholder value creation and deliver an enhanced business model that delivers cost and/or capability differentiation for our stakeholders. Our Best for All strategy is centered around adding mini mill capabilities, including through the construction of a mini mill facility in Osceola, Arkansas, non-grain oriented steel line at Big River Steel, a galvanizing construction line at Big River Steel and marketing of our new verdeXTM product line and new advanced high strength steel XG3TM products, which are completed at our PRO-TEC joint venture. Additionally, as with any significant construction project like the construction of the new mini mill in Osceola, Arkansas, we may be subject to changing market conditions and demand for our completed projects, delays and cost overruns, work stoppages, labor shortages, engineering issues, weather interferences, supply chain delays, changes required by governmental authorities, delays or the inability to acquire required permits or licenses, the ability to finance the projects or disruption of existing operations, any of which could have an adverse impact on our operational and financial results. Furthermore, new product development or modification is costly, may be restricted by regulatory requirements, involves significant research, development, time, expense and human capital and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of new products, or new technologies may not perform as intended or expected. Unsuccessful execution of these strategic projects, underperformance of any of these assets or failure of new products to gain market acceptance could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and may limit the benefits of our stockholder value creation strategy.\nFrom time to time, we engage in acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures to optimize our business footprint and portfolio. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate or separate, as applicable, assets and personnel in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction.\nAdditionally, we seek opportunities to monetize non-core and excess iron assets, including through real estate sales, third party agreements and option agreements. These opportunities may not materialize or generate the financial benefits expected. For example, Stelco Inc. holds an option (Option) to acquire an undivided 25 percent interest in a to-be-formed entity that will own the Company\u2019s current iron ore mine located in Mt. Iron, Minnesota. There is a possibility that Stelco may not exercise its Option in the anticipated timeframe or at all. If the proposed joint venture with Stelco is not successful, fails to provide the benefits we expect, or is not created at all, we may in the future have more iron ore than we need to support the business. Additionally, the existence of the Option may deter future potential opportunities to monetize the iron ore assets. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOperational Risk Factors\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe global pandemic resulting from the novel coronavirus designated as COVID-19 has had a significant impact on economies, businesses and individuals around the world. Governments around the world have made efforts to contain the virus, including: border closings and other significant travel restrictions; mandatory stay-at-home and work-from-home orders; mandatory business closures; public gathering limitations; and prolonged quarantines. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including embracing guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on physical distancing, good hygiene, limitations on employee travel and in-person meetings, and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where appropriate. Evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination and/or testing requirements as well as various related state and local directives or challenges, may cause disruptions to operations, and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs, including increased compliance costs, which could negatively affect our results. Evolving standards and judicial and regulatory interpretations may impede U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to fully comply with applicable legal requirements.\nThese actions have and may continue to impact our employees, customers and suppliers, and future developments could cause further disruptions to our business, including significant disruptions to commerce, lower consumer demand for goods and services and general uncertainty regarding the near-term and long-term impact of the COVID-19 virus on the domestic and international economy and on public health. These developments and other consequences of the outbreak have materially adversely impacted the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the past and could have similar adverse impacts in the future.\nThe Company may be susceptible to increase litigation related to, among other things, the financial impacts of the pandemic on its business, its ability to meet contractual obligations due to the pandemic, employment practices or policies adopted during the health crisis or in response to laws, regulations, or directives, or litigation related to individuals contracting COVID-19 as result of alleged exposures on Company premises.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described herein.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nU. S. Steel has adjusted its operating configuration in response to market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and gas industry disruption, global overcapacity and unfairly traded imports, and to optimize capability and cost performance, by idling and restarting production at certain facilities. Due to our operational footprint, the Company may not be able to respond in an efficient manner to fully realize the benefits from changing market conditions that are favorable to integrated steel producers or most efficiently mitigate the negative impacts of such changes.\nOur steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment, such as blast furnaces, electric arc furnaces, steel shops, casters, hot strip mills and various structures and operations, including information technology systems, that support them, as well as finishing lines at our facilities and certain of our joint ventures. While we invested in operational and reliability enhancements to our assets through the asset revitalization program, launched in 2017, and continue to implement initiatives focused on proactive maintenance of key machinery and equipment at our production facilities, we may experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, pandemics, terrorism, accidents, severe weather conditions, and changes in U.S., European Union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. We are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nU. S. Steel continues to incur costs when production capacity is idled or costs to idle facilities.\nFrom time to time, we have indefinitely or permanently idled certain of our assets or facilities and may decide to do so in the future. Our decisions concerning which facilities to operate and at what levels are made based upon market conditions, our customers\u2019 orders for products as well as the capabilities and cost performance of our locations. We may concentrate production operations at several plant locations and not operate others, and as a result we will incur idle facility costs or impairment charges.\nU. S. Steel has been and continues to be adversely affected by unfairly traded imports and global overcapacity, which may cause downward pricing pressure, lost sales and revenue, market share, decreased production, investment, and profitability.\nCurrently, global steel production capacity significantly exceeds global steel demand, which adversely affects U.S. and global steel prices. Global overcapacity continues to result in high levels of dumped and subsidized steel imports into the markets we serve. Domestic and international trade laws provide mechanisms to address the injury caused by such imports to domestic industries. Excessive steel imports have resulted and may continue to result in downward pricing pressure and lost sales and revenue, which adversely impacts our business, operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough U. S. Steel currently benefits from 60 U.S. antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD or anti-subsidy duty) orders and 12 European Union (EU) AD/CVD orders, petitions for trade relief are not always successful or effective. When implemented, such relief is generally subject to periodic reviews and challenges, which can result in revocation of AD/CVD\norders or reduction of effective duty rates. There can be no assurance that any relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief will adequately combat unfairly traded imports.\nIn the United States, AD/CVD investigations on imports of oil country tubular goods from Argentina, Mexico, Korea, and Russia and five year \u201csunset\u201d reviews of AD/CVD orders on hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel from twelve countries are expected to conclude in the second half of 2022. In the EU, AD investigations on imports of hot-dipped galvanized steel from Russia and Turkey will also conclude in 2022.\nThrough a series of Presidential Proclamations pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25 percent tariff, except: (1) imports from Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea, which are subject to restrictive quotas; (2) imports from the EU that are melted and poured in the EU, within quarterly tarrif-rate quota (TRQ) limits; (3) imports from Canada and Mexico, which are not subject to tariffs or quotas, but tariffs could be re-imposed on surging product groups after consultations; and (4) imports from Australia, which is not subject to tariffs, quotas, or an anti-surge mechanism. The Section 232 national security action on steel imports currently provides U. S. Steel and other domestic steel producers critical relief from imports. With no scheduled end date, the future coverage and duration of the Section 232 action is not known. Further, the U.S. government may negotiate alternatives to the Section 232 tariffs for certain countries, similar to its recent TRQ agreement with the EU. The Section 232 action on aluminum and steel imports, potential Section 232 action on other products, and recent and potential additional U.S. import tariffs imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 have resulted in the possibility of tariffs being applied to materials and/or items we purchase from subject countries or regions as part of our manufacturing process and may result in additional, retaliatory action by foreign governments on U.S. exports of a range of products, including products produced by our customers.\nIn February 2019, the European Commission (EC) implemented a definitive safeguard on global steel imports in the form of TRQs. The TRQs, which impose 25 percent tarriffs on steel imports that exceed the TRQ limit, are currently effective through June 2024. In December 2021, the EC initiated its third periodic review of this safeguard, which will consider the impact of the agreement to replace U.S. Section 232 tarriffs with a TRQ for certain EU steel products and may result in adjustments to the safeguard TRQ limits.\nAll of the above factors present a degree of uncertainty to our financial and operational performance, our customers, and overall economic conditions, all of which could impact steel demand and our performance. Faced with significant import competition and overcapacity in various markets, we will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, temporary shutdowns or closures of facilities.\nThe steel industry, as well as the industries of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are reliant, is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. Price fluctuations are impacted by the timing, magnitude and duration of these cycles, and are difficult to predict. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. U. S. Steel has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more stable and consistent results, even during periods of economic and market downturns, but this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. We sell to the automotive, service center, converter, energy and appliance and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, supply chain disruptions, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns or volatility in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face increased competition from alternative materials and risks concerning innovation, new technologies, products and increasing customer requirements.\nAs a result of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and increased market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change, designers, engineers and industrial manufacturers, especially those in the automotive industry, are increasing their use of lighter weight, less carbon intense and alternative materials, such as aluminum, composites, plastics, and carbon fiber. Use of such materials could reduce the demand for steel products, which may reduce our profitability and cash flow.\nAdditionally, technologies such as direct iron reduction, oxygen-coal injection and experimental technologies such as molten oxide electrolysis and hydrogen flash smelting may be more cost effective than our current production methods. However, we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies and may incur difficulties adapting and fully integrating these\ntechnologies into our existing operations. We may also encounter production restrictions, or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations to our current production processes.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials, scrap and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, or force majeure events, shortages or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, ore vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials and energy resources from third parties as well as logistics constraints moving our own raw materials and scrap to our plants. USSE purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources. Any curtailments or escalated costs may further reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel has agreed, and may continue to agree, to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that have been, and may be, above future market prices or in greater volumes than required in the future. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas, electricity and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our profit margins on indexed contracts and spot business could be reduced.\nChanges in the global economic environment, prolonged periods of slow economic growth, and global instability and actual and threatened geopolitical conflict, could have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nOverall economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including Europe, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly impact our business. Periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty could result in difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability and we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, and political factors in the U.S., which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, changes to tax laws and regulations resulting in increased income tax liability, inflation, increased regulation, limitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions taken by the U.S. government could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nUSSE is subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the EU, Slovakia and neighboring countries, and the euro currency. Changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, government instability, regional conflict, civil unrest, increased regulation and quotas, tariffs, sanctions and other market-distorting measures. Escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border may disrupt our operations and could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. USSE purchases natural gas from suppliers in the EU who purchase a significant portion of their supply from Russia. USSE purchases a significant portion of its iron ore and coal from suppliers based in Russia and Ukraine.\nAdditionally, we are also exposed to risks associated with the business success and creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic markets, we may face the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials, and bankruptcy of customers or suppliers. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nShortages of skilled labor, increased labor costs, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on skilled labor for the manufacture of our products. Some of our facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled labor often exceeds supply. Shortages of some types of skilled labor, such as electricians and qualified maintenance technicians, could restrict our ability to maintain or increase production rates, lead to production inefficiencies and increase our labor costs. Our shift to the Best for All strategy would also require a set of job skills that is different from our prior needs. Our continued success depends on the active participation of our key employees. We have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. The competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the resulting employment needs increase our risk of not being able to recruit, train and retain the employees we require at efficient costs and on reasonable terms, and could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Many companies, including U. S. Steel, have had employee lay-offs as a result of reduced business activities in an industry downturn. The loss of our key people or our inability to attract new key employees could adversely affect our operations. Additionally, layoffs or other adverse actions could result in an adverse relationship with our workforce or third-party labor providers. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain adequate\nnumbers of qualified employees and third-party labor providers on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, an overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors that affect our customers or suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nOur 2018 Labor Agreements with the USW contain provisions that may impact certain business activities.\nOur 2018 Labor Agreements with the USW contain provisions that grant the USW a limited right to bid on the Company\u2019s sale of a facility (or sale of a controlling interest in an entity owning a facility) covered by the 2018 Labor Agreements, excluding public equity offerings and/or the transfer of assets between U. S. Steel and its wholly owned subsidiaries. These agreements also require a minimum level of capital expenditures (subject to approval of the Board of Directors) to maintain the competitive status of the covered facilities, and place certain limited restrictions on our ability to replace product produced at a covered facility with product produced at other than Company facilities or affiliates or U.S. or Canadian facilities with employee protections similar to the protections found in the 2018 Labor Agreements when the Company is operating covered facilities below capacity. The provisions in the 2018 Labor Agreements, as well as current or future proposed legislation or regulations, could favorably or unfavorably impact certain business activities including pricing, operating costs, margins, and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace.\nThe 2018 Labor Agreements covering most USW represented employees have a termination date of September 1, 2022 and to the extent that successor agreements or extensions are not agreed upon as of this date, there exists a potential risk of labor disruption at covered plants.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity threats may adversely affect our business operations.\nDespite efforts to protect confidential business information, personal data of employees and contractors, and the control systems of manufacturing plants, U. S. Steel systems and those of our third-party service providers have been and may be subject to cyber-attacks or system breaches. System breaches can lead to theft, unauthorized disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary business data, personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive information, to defective products, production downtime and damage to production assets, and the inaccessibility of key systems, with a resulting impact to our reputation, competitiveness and operations. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWhile the Company continually works to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches or mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data, particularly with the recent proliferation of ransomware attacks around the world. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, investigations and/or adverse proceedings with government regulators or enforcement agencies, litigation with third parties, disruption to our systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personally identifiable, or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities resulting from a cybersecurity attack.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties, including the recently divested Transtar business, for transportation of the products we manufacture as well as delivery of our raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry or otherwise, may adversely affect our results of operations as we may not be able to pass such cost increases on to our customers.\nIf any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nOur business and execution of our strategy require substantial expenditures for capital investments, debt service obligations, operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund, which may require other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt.\nWe have approximately $3.9 billion of total debt (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures or debt service obligations, we may face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, terminate strategic projects, or to dispose of material assets or operations or issue additional debt or equity. We may not be able to take such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Credit Facility Agreement, the documents governing the USSK Credit Facilities, the documents governing the Big River Steel credit facility and Big River Steel notes, and the indentures governing our existing senior unsecured notes may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other debt when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results or operations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nOur ability to service or refinance our debt or fund investments and capital expenditures required to maintain or expand our business operations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions such as the chip supply shortage in the automotive industry. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to satisfy our liquidity needs. In addition, the availability under certain of our debt instruments may be limited if we do not meet certain financial covenants. Furthermore, the agreements governing the BRS ABL Facility and other outstanding indebtedness of Big River Steel LLC and its subsidiaries limit their ability, subject to certain exceptions, to pay dividends or distributions or make other restricted payments, such that we may not be able to access the cash generated by these recently acquired subsidiaries to fund our other expenditures.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our senior unsecured notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the USSK Credit Facilities, and the Export Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, accelerate full repayment of any or all amounts outstanding (which may result in the cross acceleration of certain of our other debt obligations) and the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFurthermore, ratings agencies could downgrade our ratings either due to factors specific to our business, a prolonged cyclical downturn in the steel industry, macroeconomic trends such as global or regional recessions and trends in credit and capital markets more generally. Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2020 by three credit ratings agencies, all citing among other things, the uncertainty in duration and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. During 2021, Moody's and S&P upgraded U. S. Steel and Big River Steel's credit ratings, while Fitch upgraded U. S. Steel\u2019s credit ratings. Ratings agencies also may lower, suspend or withdraw ratings on the outstanding securities of U. S. Steel or Big River Steel. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market prices of such securities.\nAny decline in our operating results or downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital or entering into any business transaction more difficult, lead to reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit, adversely affect the terms of future borrowings, may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, and lead to reductions in the availability of credit.\nWe have significant retiree health care, retiree life insurance and pension plan costs, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering many of our domestic employees and former employees upon their retirement. Some of these benefit plans are not fully funded, and thus will require cash funding in future years. Minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans (other than contributions to the Steelworkers Pension Trust (SPT) described below) are regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).\nThe level of cash funding for our defined benefit pension plans in future years depends upon various factors, including voluntary contributions that we may make, future pension plan asset performance, actual interest rates under the law, the impact of business acquisitions or divestitures, union negotiated benefit changes and future government regulations, many of which are not within our control. In addition, assets held by the trusts for our pension plan and our trust for retiree health care and life insurance benefits are subject to the risks, uncertainties and variability of the financial markets. Future funding requirements could also be materially affected by differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets, actuarial data and\nassumptions relating to plan participants, the discount rate used to measure the pension obligations and changes to regulatory funding requirements. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of assumptions and further information associated with these benefit plans.\nU. S. Steel contributes to a domestic multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, the SPT, for USW-represented employees formerly employed by National Steel and represented employees hired after May 2003. We have legal requirements for future funding of this plan should the SPT become significantly underfunded or we decide to withdraw from the plan. Either of these scenarios may negatively impact our future cash flows. The 2018 Labor Agreements increased the contribution rate for most steelworker employees. Collectively bargained company contributions to the plan could increase further as a result of future changes agreed to by the Company and the USW.\nThe accounting treatment of equity method investments and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.\nWe periodically test our equity method investments and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry and general economic conditions. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. We have incurred asset impairment charges in recent years, including during the year ended December 31, 2021, and there can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks, which may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of USSE are reported in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro negatively affects our Consolidated Results of Operations. International cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans, which may create intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved, which can have a non-cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period. Procurement of equipment of announced strategic projects may be denominated in foreign currencies, which could adversely affect the costs of these projects.\nIn addition, foreign producers, including foreign producers of subsidized or unfairly traded steel with foreign currency denominated costs may gain additional competitive advantages or target our home markets if the U.S. dollar or euro exchange rates strengthen relative to those producers' currencies. Volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition.\nFinancial regulatory frameworks introduced by U.S. and EU regulators may limit our financial flexibility or increase our costs.\nWe use swaps, forward contracts and similar agreements to mitigate our exposure to volatility, which entails a variety of risks. The Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s Dodd Frank and the EU\u2019s European Market Infrastructure Regulation and other government agencies' regulatory frameworks can limit the Company\u2019s ability to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange (FX), or commodity pricing exposures, which could expose us to increased economic risk. These frameworks may introduce additional compliance costs or liquidity requirements. Some counterparties may cease hedging as a result of increased regulatory cost burdens, which in turn may reduce U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to hedge its interest rate, FX, or commodity exposures.\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings, the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flows in a particular period.\nWe are involved at any given time in various litigation matters, including administrative and regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial disputes. Our profitability and cash flows in a particular period could be negatively affected by an adverse ruling or settlement in any legal proceeding or investigation. While we believe that we have taken appropriate actions to mitigate and reduce these risks, due to the nature of our operations, these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings or investigations may arise from time to time.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to product liability claims that may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Events such as well failures, line pipe leaks, blowouts, bursts, fires and product recalls could result in claims that our products or services were defective and caused death, personal injury, property damage or environmental pollution. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate, available to protect us in the event of a claim, or its coverage may be limited, canceled or otherwise terminated, or the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on our enterprise value after a loss. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies for claims asserted against us in connection with litigation, arbitrations and environmental issues. Adverse developments in litigation, arbitrations,\nenvironmental issues or other legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could negatively affect our operations, financial results and cash flows. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nRegulatory Risk Factors\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws and regulations continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA and similar state and local requirements, governing air emissions, could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs and could change the equipment or facilities we operate. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail substantial costs for emission-based systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, the Company must obtain, maintain and comply with numerous permits, leases, approvals, consents and certificates from various governmental authorities in connection with the construction and operation of new production facilities or modifications to existing facilities. In connection with such activities, the Company may need to make significant capital and operating expenditures to detect, repair and/or control air emissions, to control water discharges or to perform certain corrective actions to meet the conditions of the permits issued pursuant to applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant environmental remediation costs that negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of U. S. Steel's current and former facilities were in operation before many federal and state environmental regulations were in place. Hazardous materials associated with those facilities have been and may continue to be encountered at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.\nU. S. Steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities, facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by U. S. Steel was deposited. In addition, there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become subject to remediation, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nReducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with new regulations as well as stakeholder expectations and mitigate potential physical impacts of climate change could significantly increase costs to manufacture future materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nIron and steel producers around the world are facing mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of iron and steel are caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, the use of electrical energy, and the use of coal, lime, and iron ore as feedstock. The two main production processes are the integrated route of blast furnace ironmaking in combination with basic oxygen furnace steelmaking (BOF) and the alternative route of electric arc furnace steelmaking. Both routes generate greenhouse gas emissions with the latter process, involving the electric arc melting of a majority of steel scrap, generating less than half that, or less, of the traditional integrated steelmaking process. Federal, state and local governmental agencies within the United States may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change, including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms. Any\nsuch regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning climate change and GHG emissions. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability, and that of our customers and suppliers, to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations. Inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the Company's assets and investments. In addition, changes in certain environmental regulations, including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions, could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials to us and other steel producers.\nAdditionally, the European Union has established aggressive CO2 reduction targets of 40% by 2030, against a 1990 baseline, and full carbon neutrality by 2050. As part of the European Green Deal the Commission proposed in September 2020 to raise the 2030 reduction target to at least 55% compared to 1990. The new target has yet to be endorsed by the European Parliament. An emission trading system (ETS) was established to encourage compliance with set emissions reduction targets. These aggressive targets require drastic measures within the steel industry to comply. The transition to EAF technology, as well as incremental gains in energy reduction, use of renewable energy and continued asset and process improvements (including EAF steelmaking), are expected to reduce our GHG footprint. However, the development of breakthrough technologies is likely required to continue the path of low to no carbon footprint in the steel industry. Implementation of new technologies will most likely require significant amounts of capital and an abundant source of low-cost hydrogen and/or green power, most likely leading to an increase in the cost of future steelmaking. In addition, the cost of emission allowances is forecast to increase, along with the number of allowances decreasing in the next several years. The price of CO2 emission allowances was 80 euro per metric ton as of December 31, 2021 and forecasts call for potential price increase to 100 euro per metric ton.\nThe physical impacts of climate change may also have a material adverse effect on our costs and operations. Climate change may be associated with increased occurrence of extreme weather conditions, which could include, among other things, increased risk of flooding, potential heat stress at facilities, and other natural disasters that may lead to supply chain and operational disruptions. Damage resulting from such extreme weather conditions may not be fully insured.\nReduced access to or increased cost of capital may occur as financial institutions and investors also increase expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters.\nNew and changing data privacy laws and cross-border transfer requirements could have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the processing and transfer of data between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners, and with third-party service providers, which may be subject to data privacy laws and cross-border transfer restrictions. In North America and Europe, new legislation and changes to the requirements or applicability of existing laws, as well as evolving standards and judicial and regulatory interpretations of such laws, may impact U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to effectively process and transfer data both within the United States and across borders in support of our business operations and/or keep pace with specific requirements regarding safeguarding and handling personal information. While U. S. Steel takes steps to comply with these legal requirements, non-compliance could lead to possible administrative, civil, or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to the Company and its employees. The costs of compliance with privacy laws such as the GDPR and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach may have a negative impact on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 76644, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "X"}
