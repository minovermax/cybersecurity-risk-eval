RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following material risk factors and other information in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could be seriously impacted. As a result, the trading price, if any, of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Related to the Used Luxurious Car Leasing Business\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance.\nWe started the used luxurious car leasing business in May 2018. Because of the uncertainties related to our limited historical operations, including the limited historical operations of Beijing Tianxing, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses.\nAs our business develops, or in response to competition, we may continue to introduce new services and products or make adjustments to our existing services and products, or make adjustments to our business model. Any significant change to our business model may not achieve expected results and may have a material and adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. It is therefore difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and challenges we encounter or may encounter in this developing and rapidly evolving market. These risks and challenges include our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf expand our customer base;\n\u25cf broaden our service and product offerings;\n\u25cf enhance our risk management capabilities;\n\u25cf improve our operational efficiency;\n\u25cf our ability to raise sufficient fund to expand our operations;\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate talented employees;\n\u25cf a decrease in demand for automobiles renting and weakness in the automotive industry generally;\n\u25cf navigate an evolving regulatory environment; and\n\u25cf defend ourselves against litigation, regulatory, privacy or other claims.\nIf we fail to educate potential consumers about the value of our products and services, if the market for our marketplace does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of our target market, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAs such we may incur losses in the future. If our revenues decrease, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner because many of our costs are fixed at least, in the short term. In addition, if we reduce variable costs to respond to losses, this may limit our ability to acquire customers and grow our revenues. Accordingly, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our luxurious car leasing business has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management, including Mr. Jin Ding, our Chief Product Officer, could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to execute our luxurious car leasing business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. In the event these key personnel terminate their employment relationship with us, their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues.\nDecreases in consumer demand could adversely affect the market for vehicle rentals and, as a result, reduce the number of consumers using our services. Consumer rentals of vehicles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. Rentals of vehicles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment. Increased environmental regulation has made, and may in the future make, used luxurious cars more expensive and less desirable for consumers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by challenges to the larger automotive ecosystem, including urbanization, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues. For example, car rideshare services, such as Uber, DiDi, and other services that allow people to supplement transit trips and share vehicles are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for the pre-owned luxurious vehicles we rent, particularly as urbanization increases. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe concept of luxurious car leasing is relatively new and failure to acquire customers may negatively affect our results of operations.\nGiven that the concept of luxurious car leasing is relatively new, it may take some time for the general public to become receptive to our business. In addition, there is an inherent limit on the amount of customers who can afford our services. Failure to promote the luxurious car services to general public or to continue increase our customer base may cause difficulty for our business expansion and our results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from existing and new companies that provide, among other things car rental services.\nOur current and future competitors may include:\n\u25cf providers of offline, membership-based car rental services;\n\u25cf used luxurious car dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as: Benson, V-FLY Travel and Wagons;\n\u25cf national rental car companies such as China Auto Rental, as well as local and regional car rental services;\n\u25cf vehicle rental services, and other pay-as-you-go services, such as DiDi and 1Hai; and\n\u25cf other automobile manufacturers that could change their rental models through technology and infrastructure investment.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online and traditional automotive rental market with competing brands, business models, products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results. Some of these companies have significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to provide consumers access to a greater inventory of vehicles at lower prices while delivering a competitive online experience.\nOur current and potential competitors may also develop and market new technologies that may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur current and potential competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future business model, products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. For example, manufacturers are beginning to develop automated, driverless vehicles that could eventually reduce the demand for, or replace, traditional vehicles, including the vehicles that we currently provide. In addition, if our competitors develop business models, products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, it may adversely impact our business.\nOur competitors may also impede our ability to reach consumers or commence operations in certain jurisdictions. For example, our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines. Additionally, our competitors could use their political influence and increase lobbying efforts resulting in new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that could prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their business. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond to changes in the automotive industry more quickly with new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our automobiles, products and services could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another one of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future providers and suppliers, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve and grow our business. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon access to a desirable vehicle inventory. Obstacles to acquiring attractive inventory, whether because of supply, competition, or other factors, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business requires that we have access to a large number of quality vehicles. We currently acquire vehicles for rent directly from used luxury car owners. In the future we plan to acquire pre-owned luxurious cars from franchise dealerships as well as trade-ins and wholesale auction. The source from which we can acquire vehicles of a quality and in a quantity acceptable to us are limited, and there is substantial competition to acquire the vehicles we purchase. There can be no assurance that the supply of desirable vehicles will be sufficient to meet our needs. A reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory, including an increase in competition for quality vehicles, could diminish our ability to obtain sufficient inventory at a price that we can reflect in retail market prices and would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we evaluate potential vehicles regularly using third-party systems to predict mechanical soundness, consumer desirability and relative value of prospective inventory. If we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market trade-in offer trends, or fail to recognize those trends, it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory effectively. Our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition, both from new and used car dealers directly and through third party websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to rent out inventory. Failure to rent out our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf actual rentals are materially less than our forecasts, we would experience an over-supply of vehicle inventory. An over-supply of vehicle inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product rental prices and margins and increase our average days to rent.\nPre-owned vehicle inventory has typically represented, and will continue to represent, a significant portion of our total assets. Having such a large portion of our total assets in the form of pre-owned vehicle inventory for an extended period of time subjects us to depreciation and other risks that may affect our results of operations. Accordingly, if we have excess inventory or our average days to rent increases, we may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner, or do so at prices that would allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of pre-owned vehicles.\nAny significant changes in rental prices for pre-owned luxurious vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. For example, if rental prices for pre-owned vehicles rise relative to rental prices for new vehicles, it could make renting a new vehicle more attractive to consumers than renting a used vehicle, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in reduced used car rentals and lower revenue. Pre-owned vehicle prices may also decline due to an increased number of new vehicle lease returns over the next several years. While lower prices of pre-owned vehicles reduce our cost of acquiring new inventory, lower prices could also lead to reductions in the value of inventory that we currently hold, which could have a negative impact on gross profit. Furthermore, any significant changes in wholesale prices for pre-owned vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing our profit margins.\nIf our inventory or other costs of operations increase and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, we may be unable to maintain or grow our sales margins.\nOur inventory and other costs are variable and dependent upon various factors, many of which are outside of our control. A rise in vehicle acquisition costs could erode our sales margins and negatively affect our results of operations. If we incur cost increases, we may seek to pass those increases along to our customers. However, our consumers typically have limits on the maximum amount they can afford, and we may be unable to pass these costs along to them in the form of higher rental prices, which would adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase margins.\nWe rely heavily on logistics in transporting vehicles for delivery from point of purchase to our facilities, and finally to the customers, via our sales persons as well as third parties. Our ability to manage this process both internally and through our network of transportation partners could cause a rise in inventory costs and a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution. Further, any disruption in the vehicle transport industry or an increase in the cost of transport could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be negatively affected if losses for which we do not have third-party insurance coverage increase or our insurance coverages prove to be inadequate.\nWe have third-party insurance coverage, subject to limits, for risks such as theft and damages to vehicles that are rented and are not otherwise covered by renters\u2019 insurance, and theft and damage to vehicles in our inventory. We self-insure (that is, we do not have third-party insurance coverage) for bodily injury and property damage resulting from accidents involving our vehicles that are rented. We account for vehicle damage or total loss at the time such damage or loss is incurred. As a result, we are responsible for damage to our vehicles. A deterioration in claims management, whether by our management or by a third-party claims administrator, could lead to delays in settling claims, thereby increasing claim costs. In the future, we may be exposed to liability for which we self-insure at levels in excess of our historical levels and to liabilities for which we are insured that exceed the level of our insurance. Claims filed against us in excess of insurance limits, or for which we are otherwise self-insured, or the inability of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise-insured claims, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, damages resulting from a significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, fire or flood, or judgment against us for liability for damages resulting from our rental program could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Should we be unable to renew our commercial insurance policies at competitive rates, this loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be to successfully attract new visitors to our physical locations and our online platform. Because we are a consumer brand \u201cBatcar,\u201d we rely on marketing and advertising to increase brand visibility with potential customers. We intend to execute our sales and marketing efforts by utilizing a multi-channel approach that utilizes brand building, as well as direct response channels in order to efficiently establish and grow both locally and nationally and to increase the strength, recognition and trust in the \u201cBatcar\u201d brand.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we grow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in customer traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, or if our broad marketing campaigns are not successful or are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to liabilities resulting from the use of our vehicles by our rental customers.\nOur business can expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of vehicles by our rental customers. For example, a rental customer may be using a vehicle that has worn tires, a mechanical issue or some other problem, including a manufacturing defect, which could contribute to a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury, death or significant property damage for which we may be liable. In addition, since we cannot physically inspect our vehicles after they are delivered to our customers, we depend on our rental customers and third-party service providers to inspect the vehicles prior to driving in order to identify any potential damage or safety concern with the vehicle. To the extent that we are found at fault or otherwise responsible for an accident, our insurance coverage would only cover losses up to a maximum amount.\nIn addition, as the owner of the vehicle, there is the potential that we may have vicarious liability for any damages caused by our renters, even if we are not found to be negligent. Any such liability may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe anticipate that our business will be seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts our activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe anticipate rental during summer and national holidays to be higher than other times. Significant components of our expenses are fixed, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, and staffing costs. We anticipate that seasonal changes in our revenues will not affect those fixed expenses, which typically result in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher, and lower profitability in periods when our revenues are lower. Any circumstance, occurrence or situation that disrupts our activity during these periods could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to a significant change in revenue.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. Our rental services and related activities are, or may potentially be, subject to local licensing requirements, laws regulating vehicle advertising, and laws regulating vehicle rentals. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to the local licensing requirements where we operate. Regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license, which may inhibit our ability to do business, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to our advertising, private plaintiffs, as well as regulatory and law enforcement authorities, continue to scrutinize advertising, sales, financing and insurance activities in the leasing of pre-owned vehicles. If, as a result, other automotive retailers adopt more transparent, consumer-oriented business practices, it may be difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other retailers.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change.\nWe rely on internal and external logistics to transport our vehicle inventory throughout China. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with the transportation industry. Many of these risks and costs are out of our control, and any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our own sales persons as well as third parties to transport vehicles from point of purchase to our facilities, and finally to the customers. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, gasoline prices, recalls affecting our vehicle fleet, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, insufficient internal capacity, rising prices of external transportation vendors, fuel prices and taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers, including manufacturer recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which could impact the supply of vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. Recalls and the increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding selling pre-owned vehicles with open safety recalls could (i) adversely affect pre-owned vehicle sales or valuations, (ii) cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, (iii) cause us to rent affected vehicles at a loss, (iv) force us to incur increased costs and (v) expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the rental of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may rely on agreements with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we fail to maintain adequate relationships with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases, we may be unable to maintain sufficient inventory, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may rely on agreements with third party lenders to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we are unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms or at all, or if the agreements expire and are not renewed, our inventory supply may decline, resulting in fewer vehicles available for sale. New funding arrangements may be at higher interest rates or other less favorable terms. These financing risks, in addition to rising interest rates and changes in market conditions, if realized, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to the Commodities Trading Business\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to manage the luxurious car leasing and commodities trading business effectively.\nIntegrating the commodities trading business is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration successfully. If we are unable to efficiently integrate these businesses, the attention of our management could be diverted from our existing operations and the ability of the management teams at these business units to meet operational and financial expectations could be adversely impacted, which could impair our ability to execute our business plans. Failure to successfully integrate the new commodities trading business or to realize the expected benefits of entry into the business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment in our new line of business could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\nWe have deployed a significant amount of proceeds from our financings in our new commodities business line, Huamucheng. New ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. In evaluating such endeavors, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies, opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Furthermore, these investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the risks involved with entering new competitive categories or regions, the difficulty in integrating the new business, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from our investment, the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets and liabilities and the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies.\nWe may not be able to ensure the successful implementation of our strategy to diversify our businesses.\nWe are expanding our business from the luxurious car leasing business and have entered into the commodities trading business. Such initiatives involve various risks including but not limited to the investment costs in establishing a distribution network within the PRC, leasing warehouses, offices and other working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such future plans can be successfully implemented as the successful execution of such future plans will depend on several factors, some of which are not within our control, such as retaining and recruiting qualified and skilled staff, and the continued demand for our products by our customers. Failure to implement any part of our future plans or executing such plan costs effectively, may lead to a material adverse change in our operating environment or affect our ability to respond to market or industry changes, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe expect that we will require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, build our non-ferrous metal inventory, develop new customers, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued retention of our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ms. Renmei Ouyang, our Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer, and Qun Xie, our Chief Strategy Officer. These officers play an integral role in determining our strategic direction and for executing our growth strategy and are important to our brand and culture. The loss of the services of any of these executives without qualified replacement could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed negatively by investors and analysts, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nOur business depends on adequate supply and availability of nonferrous metal commodities.\nOur planned business requires nonferrous metal commodities that are sourced from third-party suppliers. We are affected by industry supply conditions, which generally involve risks beyond our control, including costs of these materials, transportation costs and market demand. As a result, we may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of quality nonferrous metal commodities in a timely or cost-effective manner, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue and profits from our supply chain management services from a small number of clients, and adverse industry trends or the loss of one or more of any of those clients could significantly damage our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our supply chain management services to a small number of clients. Our business and future growth will continue to depend in large part on the industry trend towards outsourcing supply chain management and other business processes. If these trends do not continue or decline, demand for our supply chain management services will decline, and our financial results could suffer.\nIn addition, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could cause our revenue and or profits to decline and our financial results could suffer.\nThe supply chain management services segment of our business is expected to continue to derive the vast majority of its net revenue and or profits from sales to a small number of key clients. In general, we do not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from us, or to designate us as its sole supplier of any particular services. If any of our key clients fail to respond successfully to market shifts, we would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our revenue and or profits from key clients will not decline in future periods.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our supply chain management services revenue comes from clients in the energy, material and industrial sectors, which is intensely competitive, very volatile, and subject to rapid changes and fluctuations in the overall economic conditions. Declines in the overall performance of the energy, material and industrial sectors have in the past and could in the future, adversely affect the demand for our supply chain management services and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. In addition, industry changes, such as the transition of more collateral materials from physical form to digital form and changes in marketing channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services we currently handle. To the extent recent uncertainty in the economy or other factors result in decreased demand for our clients\u2019 products, we may experience a reduction in volumes of client products that we handle which could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain management services business, financial position and operating results.\nOur loan recommendation service and its evolving regulatory framework makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\nAs part of our commodities trading business, we also offer loan recommendation services whereby we offer our customers loan recommendation and referral services to third-party financial institutions and assume no credit risk. However, the consumer finance market in the PRC is new and may not develop as expected. The regulatory framework for this market is also evolving and may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. If our loan recommendation business practices or the business practices of the third-party financial institutions are deemed to violate any PRC laws or regulations, our loan recommendation services and its results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in a business that is cyclical and where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a business that is cyclical and where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the business in which we operate are difficult to predict. Purchase prices for the raw materials we purchase, and selling prices for our products are volatile and beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing raw material costs through adjustments to the sales price of our products, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. A significant reduction in selling prices for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and adversely impact our ability to recover purchase costs from end customers. A decline in market prices for our products between the date of the sales order and shipment of the product may impact the customer\u2019s ability to obtain letters of credit to cover the full sales amount. A decline in selling prices for our products coupled with customers failing to meet their contractual obligations may also result in a net realizable value adjustment to the average cost of inventory to reflect the lower of cost or fair market value. Additionally, changing prices could potentially impact the volume of raw materials available to us, the volume of ore and processed metal sold by us and inventory levels. The cyclical nature of our businesses tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally.\nWe expect that we will require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, develop new products or services or further improve existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our General Operations\nThe current geographic concentration where we provide services creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our luxurious car leasing business through our rental centers located in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Chengdu. We currently hold all our vehicle inventory at our rental centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Chengdu. While we have insurance to cover certain losses on those vehicles, events such as theft, fire, flood, or hail could adversely impact our business.\nWe currently conduct our commodities trading business in Shenzhen. We currently hold all our commodities inventory at our warehouse in Foshan. While we have insurance to cover certain losses on those commodities, events such as theft, fire, flood, or hail could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population. In addition, severe weather conditions, acts of God and other catastrophic occurrences in the area in which we operate or from which we obtain inventory may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties and loss of inventory. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully replicate our business model and achieve levels of success as we enter new geographic markets.\nOur failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business model is based on our ability to provide customers with a transparent and simplified solution to luxurious car leasing and commodities trading that we believe will save them time and money. If we fail to build and maintain a positive reputation, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could negatively impact results.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, and other aspects of our business, especially on industry-specific blogs and social media websites, and irrespective of their validity, could diminish consumer confidence in our services and adversely affect our brand. The growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and, thus, the speed with which reputation can be affected. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels, about us, the vehicles we offer, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe currently hold rights to the \u201cwww.imbatcar.com\u201d Internet domain name. The regulation of domain names in China is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that we believe are important for our business.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employees or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we intend to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may, from time to time, face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation, are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations, and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nIn the event we are not able to get refund from Harrison Fund, we will suffer significant losses.\nIn May 2019, the Company invested an aggregate of $1,000,000 to purchase financial products from Harrison Fund, LLC (\u201cHarrison Fund\u201d), a private equity fund, for investment return. On April 6, 2020, we filed a law suit against Harrison Fund in California seeking the full refund of the $1,000,000 investment because we identified problematic information in Harrison Fund\u2019s brochure. Based on the current stage of the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this legal proceeding, including the anticipated legal costs, remains uncertain. Therefore we recorded a full investment impairment loss of $1,000,000, which was reflected in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income (loss). We may incur significant legal fees, settlements or damages awards resulting from this or other civil litigation. If this matter is not resolved in our favor, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented these policies through our Code of Conduct. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. While we make every effort to comply with FCPA and our company Code of Conduct, we can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nWe conduct our pre-owned vehicle leasing business through Beijing Tianxing and our commodities trading business through Huamucheng by means of contractual arrangements. If the PRC courts or administrative authorities determines that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in such Chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements between Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng. Although we believe the structure for operating our business in China (including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Beijing Tianxing and its shareholders and Huamucheng and its shareholders) comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, the PRC courts or regulatory authorities may determine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or regulations. If the PRC courts or regulatory authorities determine that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual arrangements will become invalid or unenforceable.\nIf Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng or their ownership structure or the contractual arrangements, are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or if Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng fails to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u25cf revoking the business and operating licenses of Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng;\n\u25cf discontinuing or restricting the operations of Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng;\n\u25cf imposing conditions or requirements with which we, Hao Limo, Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us, Hao Limo or Beijing Tianxing to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from our financings to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u25cf imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn or around September 2011, various media sources reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the \u201cCSRC\u201d) had prepared a report proposing pre-approval by a competent central government authority of offshore listings by China-based companies with variable interest entity structures, such as ours, that operate in industry sectors subject to foreign investment restrictions. However, it is unclear whether the CSRC officially issued or submitted such a report to a higher level government authority or what any such report provides, or whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or what they would provide. If our ownership structure, contractual arrangements or businesses of Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant governmental authorities, including the CSRC, would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng, revoking the business licenses or operating licenses of Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng, discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from overseas financings to finance our business and operations in China, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contractual arrangements with Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng may not be effective in providing control over Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng.\nAll of our current revenue and net income is derived from Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng. According to our inquiries with Beijing and Shenzhen provincial authorities, provincial direct foreign controlling equity ownership in for-profit companies engaged in vehicle rental services in Beijing and Shenzhen has never been approved and such position may not change in the foreseeable future . Therefore, we currently do not intend to have an equity ownership interest in Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng but rely on contractual arrangements with Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng to control and operate their businesses. However, these contractual arrangements may not be effective in providing us with the necessary control over Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng and their operations. Any deficiency in these contractual arrangements may result in our loss of control over the management and operations of Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng, which will result in a significant loss in the value of an investment in our company. Because of the practical restrictions on direct foreign equity ownership imposed by the Beijing and Shenzhen provincial government authorities, we must rely on contractual rights through our VIE structure to effect control over and management of Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng, which exposes us to the risk of potential breach of contract by the shareholders of Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng. In addition, as Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng are jointly owned by their respective shareholders, it may be difficult for us to change our corporate structure if such shareholders refuse to cooperate with us.\nThe failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject us to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding our corporate structure.\nOn August 8, 2006, MOFCOM, joined by the CSRC, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the SAT, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the \u201cSAIC\u201d), and SAFE, jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock market. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nThe application of the M&A Rules with respect to our corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules. We believe that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals under the M&A Rules were not required in the context of our share exchange transaction because at such time the share exchange was a foreign related transaction governed by foreign laws, not subject to the jurisdiction of PRC laws and regulations. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC and MOFCOM, would reach the same conclusion, and we cannot be certain that MOFCOM or the CSRC will not deem that the transactions effected by the share exchange circumvented the M&A Rules, and other rules and notices, or that prior MOFCOM or CSRC approval is required for overseas financing. Further, we cannot rule out the possibility that the relevant PRC government agencies, including MOFCOM, would deem that the M&A Rules required us or our entities in China to obtain approval from MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies in connection with Hao Limo\u2019s control of Beijing Tianxing through contractual arrangements.\nIf the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC, MOFCOM or other approval was required for the share exchange transaction and/or the VIE arrangements between Hao Limo and Beijing Tianxing, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, we may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Common Stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure our current corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain.\nThe M&A Rules, along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy. For example, Beijing Tianxing\u2019s ability to remit its profits to us, or to engage in foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, may be conditioned upon compliance with the SAFE registration requirements by such Chinese domestic residents, over whom we may have no control.\nRegulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and could adversely affect our business.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident\u2019s registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents\u2019 failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.\nAs Circular 37 is newly-issued, it is unclear how these regulations will be interpreted and implemented. In addition, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures as to the interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and it may be difficult for our ultimate shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents to provide sufficient supporting documents required by the SAFE or to complete the required registration with the SAFE in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure by any of our shareholders who is a PRC resident, or is controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government, including restrictions on Hao Limo\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us and on our ability to increase our investment in the Hao Limo.\nOur agreements with Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng are governed by the laws of the PRC and we may have difficulty in enforcing any rights we may have under these contractual arrangements.\nAs all of our contractual arrangements with Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng are governed by the PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC, they would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could further limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Furthermore, these contracts may not be enforceable in China if PRC government authorities or courts take a view that such contracts contravene PRC laws and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng, and our ability to conduct our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nBeijing Tianxing\u2019s two shareholders have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business.\nShun Li and Jialin Cui, who collectively own 100% of Beijing Tianxing\u2019s outstanding equity interests, are the beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock of the Company through the BVI entities. Equity interests held by these shareholders in the Company is less than its interest in Beijing Tianxing as a result of our introduction of outside investors as shareholders of the Company. In addition, such shareholders\u2019 equity interest in our Company will be further diluted as a result of any future offering of equity securities. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise as a result of such dual shareholding and governance structure.\nIf such conflicts arise, these shareholders may not act in our best interests and such conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor. In addition, these shareholders may breach or cause Beijing Tianxing to breach or refuse to renew the VIE Agreements that allow us to exercise effective control over Beijing Tianxing and to receive economic benefits from Beijing Tianxing. Delaware law provides that directors owe a fiduciary duty to a company, which requires them to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company and not to use their positions for personal gain. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and such shareholders or any future beneficial owners of Beijing Tianxing, we would have to rely on arbitral or legal proceedings to remedy the situation. Such arbitral and legal proceedings may cost us substantial financial and other resources and result in disruption of our business, the outcome of which may adversely affect the Company.\nIf Beijing Tianxing or Huamucheng fails to maintain the requisite registered capital, licenses and approvals required under PRC law, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nForeign investment is highly regulated by the PRC government and the foreign investment in the vehicle rental industry is restricted by local authorities. Numerous regulatory authorities of the central PRC government, provincial and local authorities are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of the vehicle rental industry. Foreign investment in the financial leasing industry is also subject to foreign investment regulations. Each of Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng are required to obtain and maintain certain assets relevant to its business as well as applicable licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide their current services. These registered capital and licenses are essential to the operation of our business and are generally subject to annual review by the relevant governmental authorities. Furthermore, Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng may be required to obtain additional licenses. If we fail to obtain or maintain any of the required registered capital, licenses or approvals, our continued business operations in the vehicle rental industries may subject us to various penalties, such as confiscation of illegal net revenue, fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of Beijing Tianxing and Huamucheng will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our Common Stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all.\nFuture issuances of our Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our Common Stock (\u201cSecurities\u201d), or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings.\nFuture issuances of our Securities, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our Securities, or the future expirations of lock-up agreements, on the price of our Common Stock. In all events, future issuances of our Common Stock would result in the dilution of your holdings. In addition, the perception that new issuances of our Securities could occur, or the perception that locked-up parties will sell their securities when the lock-ups expire, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition to any adverse effects that may arise upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements, the lock-up provisions in these agreements may be waived, at any time and without notice. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, our Common Stock may become available for resale, subject to applicable law, including without notice, which could reduce the market price for our Common Stock.\nThe Company has outstanding warrants having a \u201ccashless exercise\u201d feature and may cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nAs part of its Registered Direct Offerings in 2019, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,760,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have a cashless exercise feature giving the holders the option of exercising the warrants on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants. If the warrant shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the warrant shares will take on the characteristics of the warrants being exercised, and the holding period of the warrant shares being issued may be tacked on to the holding period of the warrants in accordance with Section 3(a)(9).\nThe Company would not receive any proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to the holder in such a cashless exercise, causing dilution to existing stockholders with no corresponding influx of capital. This may affect our ability to raise additional equity capital.\nOur Common Stock may be thinly traded and our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares.\nOur Common Stock may be \u201cthinly-traded\u201d, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be sustained.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as:\n\u25cf the perception of U.S. investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf negative publicity, studies or reports;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other microcredit companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in China.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nVolatility in our Common Stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our Common Stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions in our By-laws and Delaware laws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our by-laws and Delaware laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our Common Stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of incorporation and the existence of indemnification of our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders to the maximum extent permitted under the corporate laws of Delaware. We may also provide contractual indemnification obligations under agreements with our directors, officers and employees. These indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breach of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and our shareholders.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAlthough we have cured the bid price deficiency, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to meet the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2014, the first fiscal year beginning after our initial public offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting and, after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Common Stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe will be required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any July 31 before that time, our revenues exceed $1 billion, or we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following January 31. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19.\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we participate, which could negatively impact our business. To this end, we are evaluating alternative working arrangements, including requiring all employees to work remotely, and we have suspended all non-essential travel for our employees and limiting in-person work-related meetings.\nIn addition, with the extended Chinese business shutdowns that resulted from the outbreak of COVID-19, we may experience delays or the inability to service our customers on a timely basis in both our luxurious car leasing business and our commodities trading business. The disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 supply chains and business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of our luxury car rental facilities, interruptions in the supply of commodities, personnel absences, and restrictions on the luxury car rental services or delivery and storage of commodities, any of which could have adverse ripple effects on our luxurious car leasing business and our commodities trading business. If we need to close any of our facilities or a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our ability to provide our products and services to our customers could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Similarly, if our customers experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19, or any other pandemic, demand for our products and services could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the localities in which we or our suppliers and customers operate within China.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. While it is too early to tell whether COVID-19 will have a material effect on our business over time, we continue to monitor the situation as it unfolds.
