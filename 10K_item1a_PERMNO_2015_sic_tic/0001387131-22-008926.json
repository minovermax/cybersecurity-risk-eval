RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results did and could continue to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to the Restatement of our Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements and Material Weaknesses in our Internal Control\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements during the past three years, including the restatement included in our 2020 Comprehensive Form 10-K/A. These restatements have affected and may continue to affect investor confidence, our stock price, our ability to raise capital in the future, and our reputation with our customers, have resulted and may continue to result in stockholder litigation and may reduce customer confidence in our ability to complete new contract opportunities.\nIn February 2019, we filed an amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which included a restatement of our financial statements for the period then ended. The restatement of such financial statements corrected an overstatement of revenue in such period due to the miscoding of an invoice in the Company\u2019s records (the \u201cCoding Error\u201d). In August 2020, we filed an Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included a restatement of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 to correct certain errors relating to our recognition of revenue, which errors resulted from an incorrect application of U.S. GAAP (the \u201cRevenue Recognition Error\u201d). In November 2021, we filed a comprehensive Form 10-K/A (the \u201cComprehensive Form 10-K/A\u201d) which included a restatement of our (i) consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders\u2019 deficit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and (ii) consolidated balance sheets and statements of shareholders\u2019 deficit as of March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020, the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the three, six and nine month periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively, and related disclosures to correct errors in such financial statements relating to the recording and reporting of inventory costing and related internal controls (the \u201cInventory Costing Errors\u201d) and resulting deficiencies in reserves (the \u201cInsufficient Reserves\u201d). The Inventory Costing Errors resulted from software processing and coding errors, inconsistent units of measure being used for quantities ordered and quantities received of certain purchased parts, incorrect accruals to accounting periods of the cost of certain goods received and the Company not having a procedure to address over or under absorbed overhead costs at the end of accounting periods. The Insufficient Reserves resulted from insufficient inventory reserves and provisions for loss contracts. The existence of the Coding Error, Revenue Recognition Error, the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves, along with the related restatements, have had and may continue to have the effect of eroding investor confidence in the Company and our financial reporting and accounting practices and processes, have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the trading price of our common stock, have resulted and may continue to result in stockholder litigation, may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and may negatively impact our reputation with our customers and cause customers to place new orders with other companies.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which did and could continue to adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nAs a result of the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the Revenue Recognition Error, we previously determined that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and in connection with the Coding Error, we previously determined that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2018. The Revenue Recognition Error, Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves caused us to fail to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility with BankUnited, N.A. and the restatement of such errors was a contributing factor in our failure to timely file periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. The Revenue Recognition Error also resulted in shareholder litigation.\nAs described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have taken a number of steps during 2021 in order to strengthen our accounting function so as to allow us to be able to provide timely and accurate financial reporting, which have remediated the internal control deficiencies that led to the Revenue Recognition Error and the internal control deficiencies that led to the Coding Error which had been previously remediated. However, such steps were not sufficient to prevent the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves referred to within Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the \u201cFirst Quarter 2021 Material Weaknesses\u201d and there can be no assurance that these steps will be successful in preventing future errors or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future.\nDuring 2021, controls and procedures have been put in place to address the Insufficient Reserves, some improvements in the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting have been made during 2021 with respect to the Inventory Costing Errors, and during 2022, we plan to conduct further work, and design and implement additional internal controls to remediate the material weakness in internal controls that existed at December 31, 2021 due to the Inventory Costing Errors, although there can be no guarantee that these controls, this work or planned additional controls will be successful.\nWe intend to continue our remediation activities and to continue to improve our overall control environment and our operational and financial systems and infrastructure, as well as to continue to train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal control. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management\u2019s time on compliance-related issues. However, we cannot ensure that the steps that we have taken or will take will successfully remediate the errors. If we are unable to successfully complete our remediation efforts or favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our operating results, financial position, ability to accurately report our financial results and timely file our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company began using inventory valuation and cost collection software associated with the Company\u2019s jobs for which revenue is recognized using the point in time method of accounting. There can be no assurance that controls over inventory will be adequate to address all potential valuation issues that may arise in the future relating to the use of the software and additional internal controls may need to be developed.\nThe occurrence of any future errors, misstatements, or failures in internal control may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor and customer confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, result in events of default under our banking agreements, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors and customers, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties or additional stockholder litigation, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to the Coding Error, the Revenue Recognition Error, the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves have diverted, and our ongoing efforts to remediate our internal control may continue to divert management from the operation of our business. The absence of timely and accurate financial information has hindered and may in the future hinder our ability to effectively manage our business.\nThe restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to the Coding Error, the Revenue Recognition Error, the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves have diverted, and our ongoing efforts to remediate our internal control may continue to divert management from the operation of our business. Our board of directors, members of management, and our accounting, and other staff have spent significant time on the restatements and remediation and will continue to spend significant time on remediation of internal control over our financial reporting. These resources have been, and will likely continue to be, diverted from the strategic and day-to-day management of our business and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.\nWe face litigation relating to the Revenue Recognition Error.\nOur Company and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors are defendants in litigation arising out of the Revenue Recognition Error in and restatements of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, and quarters ended March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018, March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019. Please see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d These proceedings may result in significant expenses and the diversion of management attention from our business. We cannot ensure that additional litigation or other claims by shareholders will not be brought in the future arising out of the same subject matter.\nWe are currently ineligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital.\nWe did not file our Quarterly Reports for the three months ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Q1 Form 10-Q\u201d) and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Q2 Form 10-Q\u201d) within the timeframes required by the SEC. We have not yet filed the 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q or the 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q. We will regain status as a current filer when we file the 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q and any subsequently delayed reports. However, we will not be considered a timely filer and will not be eligible to file a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of our securities until twelve full calendar months from the date we regain status as a current filer. If we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to such time, we will be required to use the long-form registration statement, Form S-1, which may increase both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction. This may adversely affect our ability to raise funds, if we choose to do so.\nThe NYSE American exchange has suspended trading of our common stock and may delist our common stock from trading on the exchange. If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American exchange, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock could be adversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired.\nOn May 19, 2022, the NYSE American exchange (the \u201cExchange\u201d) announced the suspension of trading of our common stock due to non-compliance with the SEC annual and quarterly report timely filing criteria provided for in Section 1007 of the Exchange\u2019s Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) and announced that it was initiating proceedings to delist our common stock. The Company filed a request for review of the Exchange\u2019s determination to initiate delisting proceedings to a Committee of the Board of Directors of NYSE Regulation (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). A hearing for this review before a Listing Qualification Panel of the Committee has been scheduled for September 7, 2022 (the \u201cHearing\u201d). The delisting action has been stayed pending the outcome of the review although trading of our common stock on the Exchange remains suspended.\nWe will become current with our SEC reports upon the filing of the 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q and the 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q. The Company believes that becoming current with our SEC reports will resolve the condition that led to NYSE American suspending trading in the Company\u2019s common stock on the Exchange and its determination to commence proceedings to delist the common stock from the Exchange. The 2022 Q1 Form 10 Q and 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q will be filed as soon as practicable. We cannot assure you that if the Company becomes current with our SEC reports before the Hearing or the outcome of the Hearing will result in the Exchange changing its delisting determination or that our common stock will resume trading on the Exchange in the future.\nOn September 17, 2021, we received notice from the Exchange indicating that the Company does not meet the continued listing standards set forth in Part 10 of the Company Guide. The Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) of the Company Guide since it has stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $2.0 million and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide since it has stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $4.0 million and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years. The Company is therefore subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and was required to, and timely did, submit a plan to the Exchange addressing how the Company intends to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by March 17, 2023 (the \u201cPlan\u201d). On November 19, 2021, we received notice from the Exchange that it accepted the Plan, subject to periodic review, including quarterly monitoring, for compliance with the Plan. If the Company\u2019s common stock is not delisted from the Exchange as a result of the Company\u2019s delayed filings as described above and (i) the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by March 17, 2023 or (ii) the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the plan period, the Exchange staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.\nThe delisting of our common stock from the Exchange could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to attract new investors, reduce the price at which our common stock trades, decrease, investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares, increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares, and reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital with overall negative effects for our stockholders.\nThere is currently a very limited trading market for our common stock and investors are not assured of the opportunity to make transactions in our common stock.\nThe Company is not current in its SEC reporting obligations with respect to its 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q and its 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q. Companies that are not current in their SEC reporting obligations in accordance with the provisions of Rule 15c-11 (\u201cRule 15c2-11\u201d) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, do not have current information publicly available and do not meet the requirements for ongoing quoting of their securities on one of the public markets (the \u201cOTC Markets\u201d) operated by the OTC Markets Group. Effective July 15, 2022, the Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group\u2019s \u201cExpert Market.\u201d\nThe Expert Market is available for unsolicited quotes only, meaning broker-dealers may use the Expert Market to publish unsolicited quotes representing orders from retail and institutional investors who are not affiliates or insiders of the Company. Quotations in Expert Market securities are made available to broker-dealers, institutions, and other sophisticated investors. Accordingly, investors are not assured of the opportunity to purchase or sell their shares when they desire to do so or at all.\nThe Company intends to become current with its SEC reporting obligations as soon as practicable. The Company anticipates that after it becomes current in its SEC reporting obligations its common stock will become eligible to be quoted on one of the OTC Markets through the filing of a Form 211 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (or reliance on OTC Market Group\u2019s current information designations in lieu thereof). There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s common stock will be quoted on an OTC Market or any other market or exchange or when that may occur in the future.\nRisks Related to Global Events\nThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our operations, supply chain, and customers has impacted and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause disruption in our supply chain or significantly increase the costs required to meet our contractual commitments, cause delay, or limit the ability of, the U.S. Government and other customers to perform, including making timely payments to us, negotiating contracts, performing quality inspections, accepting delivery of finished products, and cause other unpredictable events. The disruption of air travel has impacted demand for the commercial air industry. Commercial aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and, as a result, may reduce demand for our products. There have been and may continue to be changes in our government and commercial customers\u2019 priorities and practices, as our customers confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources. These changes may impact current and future programs, procurements, and funding decisions, which in turn could impact our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our liquidity. Slower production schedules, higher company medical costs, potential inability of our customers to make timely payments to us, and similar factors could impact our cash flows. A period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect our financial position. We implemented several plans to mitigate such risks, including requesting and obtaining progress payments from our customers and longer payment terms with our suppliers; however, we may not be successful in the future in these efforts. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our cash flow will determine whether we need to obtain additional funding, which could be difficult to obtain. Due to uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, and the volatility in the capital markets in general, access to financing may be reduced and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 affects our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or address its impact, among others. If significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers\u2019 workforces are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closure or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. For example, we believe that the impact of COVID-19 on illness and absence rates, workflows and productivity at the Company and our business partners during 2020, 2021 and year-to-date 2022 has been a contributing factor to the time required for our financial statement closing processes and the delayed filing of our SEC reports. Further absences may cause us to be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, the impact on our accounting staff and outside advisors may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the SEC.\nDuring late 2020, we began to experience an increased rate of employees testing positive for COVID-19 and we took steps to mitigate virus transmission within the workplace. These steps included adding a second manufacturing shift to lessen employee density on the manufacturing floor and to require most non-manufacturing personnel to work from home. These measures continued into 2021. Despite these measures, we experienced a relatively high level of absenteeism directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. We have taken mitigating steps in an attempt to reduce the adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business. For example, we have curtailed discretionary spending and business travel, and taken other steps to preserve cash. We have also taken action to more closely manage the flow of materials to be more responsive to unanticipated changes in customer delivery schedules. Since May 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have experienced a decrease in the impact of COVID-19. However, we believe that the impact of COVID-19 on illness and absence rates, workflows and productivity at the Company and our business providers has been a contributing factor to the time required for our financial statement closing processes and the delayed filing of our SEC reports. Most non-manufacturing personnel have now returned to their regular in-person work schedules and we have returned to a single day shift manufacturing operation, although we do continue to experience employees and business partners with new COVID-19 diagnoses on an intermittent basis and we take needed steps to mitigate these impacts on the Company\u2019s operation as they occur.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the retaliatory measures imposed by the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union and other countries and the responses of Russia to such measures have caused significant disruptions to domestic and foreign economies.\nThe invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation had an immediate impact on the global economy resulting in higher prices for oil and other commodities. The U.S., United Kingdom, European Union and other countries responded to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions and bans. Russia has responded with its own retaliatory measures. These measures have impacted the availability and price of certain raw materials and transportation costs. The invasion and retaliatory measures also disrupted economic markets. The global impact of these measures is continually evolving and cannot be predicted with certainty and there is no assurance that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and responses thereto will not further disrupt the global economy and supply chain. Further, there is no assurance that even when the invasion of Ukraine ceases, that nations will not continue to impose sanctions and bans on other nations.\nWhile these events have not interrupted our operations or materially impacted our ability to obtain raw materials, these or future developments resulting from the invasion of Ukraine such as a cyberattack on the U.S., us or our suppliers, could make it difficult for or increase the cost of certain raw materials and transportation costs, or make it difficult to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, if at all, and impact our ability to fund business activities and repay debt on a timely basis.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may alter countries\u2019 willingness to rely on others as the source of certain products and material.\nHistorically, prime contractors and OEMs in the U.S. A&D industry have relied upon suppliers outside the U.S. for products and raw materials. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the economic disruption resulting from retaliatory measures may cause many of these companies to rethink these strategies and seek sources of supply within the U.S. To the extent they do so, it could disrupt domestic markets for raw materials and supplies, and the market for the skilled laborers we need to manufacture our products.\nWe cannot forecast with any certainty whether the disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, restrictions imposed by various governments in response thereto and resulting changes in business practices, may materially impact our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nTerrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. and global responses to actual or potential military conflicts such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats and other global political crises increase uncertainties with respect to the U.S. and other business and financial markets. Several factors associated, directly or indirectly, with actual or potential military conflicts, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical and cyber threats, and other global political crises and responses thereto, may adversely affect the mix of products purchased by defense departments in the U.S. or other countries to platforms not serviced by us. A shift in defense budgets to product lines we do not produce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn reading the risk factors set forth below, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by global events such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine and terrorist acts.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on government contracts for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe are a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor, to the U.S. Government and its agencies. We depend on government contracts for a significant portion of our business. If we are suspended or barred from contracting with the U.S. Government, if our reputation or relationship with individual federal agencies were impaired, whether due to the restatements and errors in our financial statements or otherwise, or if the U.S. Government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks relating to government contracts.\nThe funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, the U.S. Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. Appropriations are driven by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions, the ability of the U.S. Government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and continuing resolutions, and the threat or existence of a government shutdown. U.S. Government appropriations for our programs and for defense spending generally may be impacted or delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic as governmental priorities and finances change. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced in budgets approved by Congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. In the event that appropriations for any of our programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such program, and on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, completely or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the U.S. Government\u2019s convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract for convenience could also result in the cancellation of future work on that program. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract. Termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts. Additionally, we are a subcontractor on some U.S. Government contracts. In these arrangements, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. Government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our U.S. Government contracts.\nWe have risks associated with competing in the bidding process for contracts.\nWe obtain many of our contracts through a competitive bidding process. In the bidding process, we face the following risks:\n\u25cf we must bid on programs in advance of their completion, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties or cost overruns;\n\u25cf we must devote substantial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us; and\n\u25cf awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in profitability.\nFurther consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is experiencing significant consolidation, including among our customers, competitors and suppliers. While we believe we have positioned our Company to take advantage of opportunities to market to a broad customer base, which we believe will reduce the potential impact of industry consolidation, there can be no assurance that industry consolidation will not impact our business. Consolidation among our customers may result in delays in the awarding of new contracts and losses of existing business. Consolidation among our competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. Consolidation among our suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost to us.\nWe depend upon a select base of large prime defense contractors for the majority of our revenue, which subjects us to unique risks which may adversely affect us.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenues by producing products for numerous programs under contracts with three prime defense contractors to the U.S. Government. These significant customers - Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon - constituted approximately 32%, 22% and 19%, respectively of our 2021 revenue. Our revenues from these customers are diversified over a number of different aerospace and defense products, programs and subsidiaries within these customers, however, any significant change in production rates by any of these customers would have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows. There is no assurance that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels, that we will retain any or all of our existing significant customers, or that we will be able to form new relationships with other customers upon the loss of one or more of our existing significant customers.\nWe are subject to strict governmental regulations relating to the environment, which could result in fines and remediation expense in the event of non-compliance.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. In addition, these regulations may impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Furthermore, we are required to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances. Our operations require the use of a limited amount of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning that are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. If we are found not to comply with any of these rules, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines, remediation expenses and the obligation to change our business practice, any of which could result in substantial costs that would adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to fines and disqualification for non-compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the FAA under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business and our profitability could be materially and adversely impacted.\nMost of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services that we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of personnel of a subcontractor, or disputes concerning payment. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer eliminating our ability to progress bill or terminating our contract for default. A prohibition on progress billing may have an adverse effect upon our cash flow and profitability and a default termination could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and may have a material adverse effect upon our profitability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above.\nDue to fixed contract pricing, increasing contract costs exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nOperating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to customers are incurred. This cost growth can occur if estimates to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, pandemics, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant increase in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates may affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe primarily recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period pursuant to ASC 606. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset captioned \u201cContract assets.\u201d Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability captioned \u201cContract liabilities.\u201d Changes to the original estimates may be required during the term of the contract. Estimates are reviewed quarterly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period the change becomes known. ASC 606 requires the use of considerable estimates in determining revenues and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.\nWe continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of ASC 606; however, there is no assurance that our estimates will be accurate. If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods. Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay for costs until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.\nIf the contracts associated with our backlog were terminated, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe maximum contract value specified under each contract that we enter into is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, we may not accurately estimate our backlog because the earnings of revenues on programs included in backlog may never occur or may change. Cancellations of pending contracts or terminations or reductions of contracts in progress would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior officers and engineers. Competition for key personnel is intense. Our ability to attract and retain senior officers and experienced, top rate engineers is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent and our reputation in the industry. If our reputation is adversely affected, for instance due to our handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to recruit, hire, and retain talented personnel. The inability to hire and retain these persons may adversely affect our production operations and other aspects of our business.\nWe are subject to intense competition for the skilled technicians necessary to manufacture our products.\nWe are subject to intense competition for the services of skilled technicians necessary to manufacture our products and those of other companies in the A&D industry. The demand for these individuals may increase as other manufacturers seek to bring to the U.S. manufacturing processes currently outsourced overseas. If the U.S. economy undergoes a period of inflation, our labor costs may increase which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry, and any future downturn in the commercial aerospace industry or general economic conditions, including related to COVID-19, could adversely impact the demand for our products.\nOur business may be affected by certain characteristics and trends of the commercial aerospace industry or general economic conditions that affect our customers, such as fluctuations in the aerospace industry\u2019s business cycle, varying fuel and labor costs, intense price competition and regulatory scrutiny, certain trends, including a possible decrease in aviation activity and a decrease in outsourcing by aircraft manufacturers or the failure of projected market growth to materialize or continue. In the event that these characteristics and trends adversely affect customers in the commercial aerospace industry, they may reduce the overall demand for our products. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted, and continues to impact, the commercial aerospace industry, as described above.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under the BankUnited credit facility to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nWe incur risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design changes, development of new production tools, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in the regulatory or other certification or manufacturing and delivery schedule. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new programs to the customer\u2019s satisfaction, if we were unable to manufacture products at our estimated costs, or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or technological problems, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This risk includes the potential for default, quality problems, or inability to meet specifications, as well as our inability to negotiate final pricing for program changes, and could result in low margin or forward loss contracts, and the risk of having to write-off contract assets if they were deemed to be unrecoverable. In addition, beginning new work on existing programs also carries risk associated with the transfer of technology, knowledge and tooling.\nIn order to perform on new programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs which may not have been negotiated in our selling price. Additionally, we may have made margin assumptions related to those costs, that in the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, or if we are not successful in negotiating favorable margin on scope changes, could cause us to experience margin degradation which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nWe are presently classified as a small business and the loss of our small business status may adversely affect our ability to compete for government contracts.\nWe are presently classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification Systems (\u201cNAICS\u201d) industry and product specific codes that are regulated in the U.S. by the Small Business Administration. We are not considered a small business under all NAICS codes. While we do not presently derive a substantial portion of our business from contracts that are set-aside for small businesses, we are able to bid on small business set-aside contracts as well as contracts that are open to non-small business entities. As the NAICS codes are periodically revised, it is possible that we may lose our status as a small business. The loss of small business status would adversely affect our eligibility for special small business programs and limit our ability to collaborate with other business entities which are seeking to team with small business entities as may be required under a specific contract.\nCyber security attacks, internal system or service failures may adversely impact our business and operations.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by projects to improve our information technology systems, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide products and related services to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing and other unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information related to us or our products, customers or suppliers, or other acts that could lead to disruptions in our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of our non-manufacturing employees to shift to work-from-home arrangements at times, which increases our vulnerability to email phishing, social engineering or \u201chacking\u201d through our remote networks, and similar cyber-attacks aimed at employees working remotely. Because the techniques used by cyber-attackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics. Any such failures to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs or subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, including contracting with an outside cyber security firm to provide constant monitoring of our systems, and training our employees to recognize attacks, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures.\nThe Company may evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable sellers or business partners, perform effective assessments prior to contract execution, negotiate contract terms, and, if applicable, obtain customer and government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations, and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to utilize our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we fail to generate sufficient income or if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $81.9 million of gross net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for federal tax purposes and approximately $40.5 million of post-apportionment NOLs for state tax purposes. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. Our pre-2018 NOLs totaled approximately $78.9 million; these NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2034 through 2039, if not utilized, and can offset 100% of future taxable income for regular tax purposes. Our NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 can generally be carried back five years, carried forward indefinitely and can offset 100% of taxable income for tax years before January 1, 2021 and up to 80% of taxable income for tax years after December 31, 2020. Any NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2021, cannot be carried back, can generally be carried forward indefinitely and can offset up to 80% of future taxable income.\nOur ability to fully recognize the benefits from our NOLs is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient income prior to their expiration. In addition, our NOL carryforwards may be limited if we experience an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d). In general, an ownership change under Section 382 occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our outstanding shares by more than 50 percentage points over a relevant lookback period. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we have determined that no ownership change occurred during the relevant lookback period that would limit our ability to use our NOLs, however the sale of additional equity securities in the future may trigger an ownership change under Section 382 which could significantly limit our ability to utilize our tax benefits.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social, and governance, or sustainability responsibilities could expose us to additional costs and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and stock price.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, and other key stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors. Some investors may use ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibilities are inadequate.\nThe ESG factors by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change. This could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we are unable to satisfy the new corporate responsibility criteria, investors may view our policies related to corporate responsibility as inadequate. We risk damage to our reputation in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or goals do not meet the standards or goals set by various constituencies. In addition, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest in our competitors instead. Further, in the event we communicate certain initiatives or goals related to ESG, we could fail, or be perceived to have failed, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders, or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us, financial results, and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe obtained amendments to and received waivers of and consents to non-compliance with certain covenants under our credit facility with BankUnited and there can be no assurance that we will not fall out of compliance with our covenants in the future.\nThe Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its credit facility (the \u201cBankUnited Facility\u201d or the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with BankUnited, N.A. (\u201cBankUnited\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2020,the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2021 and the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and financial statement submission covenants for the year ended December 31, 2020, the quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2021 and the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 and obtained amendments to and received waivers of and consents to the non-compliance, as described in more detail in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with our covenants in the future or that BankUnited will grant further waivers if we fall out of compliance or consents to future non-compliance. If we fall out of compliance with our banking covenants, BankUnited may declare a default under the BankUnited Facility and, among other remedies, could declare the full amount of the BankUnited Facility immediately due and payable and could foreclose against our collateral. If this were to occur, we may be unable to secure outside financing, if needed, to fund ongoing operations and for other capital needs. Any sources of financing that may be available to us could also be at higher costs and require us to satisfy more restrictive covenants, which could limit or restrict our operations, cash flows and earnings. We cannot ensure that additional financing would be available to us, or be sufficient or available on satisfactory terms.\nOur capital requirements, liquidity and financial condition raise significant risk as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of the conclusion of mature programs and new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. There is currently no availability for borrowings under our credit facility (the \u201cBankUnited Facility\u201d) and the Company finances its operations from internally generated cash flow. Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8 includes a discussion regarding the BankUnited Facility and recent amendments thereto which provide, among other things, for increases in principal payments and the interest rate on the loans provided for therein. Also, the Company currently has a shareholders\u2019 deficit and has experienced losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations in prior periods. These factors collectively represent significant risk to the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate as a going concern and management has assessed these risks. Based upon this assessment and the execution of the plans described in Part II Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Outlook - Liquidity, it is management\u2019s estimation that there will likely not be any individual conditions or combination of events that will occur in the coming year which would cause the Company to be unable to meet its obligations or otherwise continue as a going concern. However, we cannot ensure that such plans will accomplish their intended goals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 77900, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "CVU"}
