{"cik": "1632790", "company": "ENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements in MD&A. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face risks associated with global economic conditions.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions and uncertainty about future economic prospects could reduce consumer demand for our products. This could occur as a result of a reduction in discretionary spending or a shift of purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private label brands sold by retail chains or price brands. This shift could drive the market towards lower margin products or force us to reduce prices for our products in order to compete. Similarly, our retailer customers could reduce their inventories, shift to different products or require us to lower our prices to retain the shelf placement of our products. Declining financial performance by certain of our retailer customers could impact their ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all. Worsening economic conditions could harm our sales and profitability. Additionally, disruptions in financial markets could reduce our access to debt and equity capital markets, negatively affecting our ability to implement our business strategy.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nThe categories in which we operate are mature and highly competitive, both in the United States and globally, as a limited number of large manufacturers compete for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, as well as increasing retailer concentration, our retailer customers, including online retailers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms, resulting in either reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower-cost competitors.\nCompetition is based upon brand perceptions, innovation, product performance, customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do, which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nour competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins, which may enable them to offer aggressive retail discounts and other promotional incentives;\n\u2022\nour competitors have obtained, and may in the future be able to obtain, exclusivity or sole source at particular retailers or favorable in-store placement; and\n\u2022\nwe may lose market share to certain retailers, including club stores, grocery, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers, which may offer \u201cprivate label\u201d brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Company\u2019s products in certain categories.\nThe changing retail environment could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery, mass retail outlet, warehouse club and dollar store channels. The retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business. Alternative retail channels, including hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, have become more prevalent and consumer products are increasingly being sold through such alternative retail channels. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are not successful in expanding sales in such alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly \u201cprivate label\u201d products may reduce our ability to market and sell our products through such retailers. If these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or we are not successful in these alternative retail channels, our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nLoss of reputation of our Company or our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the continuing reputation and success of our brands. Our operating results could be adversely affected if any of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. Any damage to our brands could impair our ability to charge premium prices for our products, resulting in the reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower price competitors.\nThe success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or new product offerings do not improve, or have a negative impact on, our brands\u2019 image or ability to attract and retain consumers. Additionally, if claims made in our marketing campaigns\nbecome subject to litigation alleging false advertising, which is common in our industry, it could damage our brand, cause us to alter our marketing plans in ways that may materially and adversely affect sales, or result in the imposition of significant damages against us. Negative publicity, posts or comments by consumers or competitors about the Company, its brands, is products, its marketing activities or its employees, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or network sites or through other media or in other formats. Such events, if they were to occur, could harm the Company\u2019s image and adversely affect is business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require resources to rebuild the Company\u2019s reputation.\nFurthermore, a move by one or more of our large customers to sell significant quantities of private label products, which we do not produce on their behalf and which directly compete with our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability.\nGenerally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may cancel their purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us at any time. The loss or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by any of our top customers would harm our sales and profitability. Additionally, increasing retailer customer concentration could result in reduced sales outlets for our products, as well as greater negotiating pressures and pricing requirements on us.\nOur ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.\nWe are a company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The successful development and introduction of new products requires retail and consumer acceptance and overcoming the reaction from competitors. New product introductions in categories where we have existing products will likely also reduce the sales of our existing products. Our investments in research and development may not result in successful products or innovation that will recover the costs of such investments. Our customers or end consumers may not purchase our new products once introduced. Additionally, new products could require regulatory approval which may not be available or may require modification to the product which could impact the production process. Our competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that outperform ours, or develop manufacturing technology that permits them to manufacture at a lower cost relative to ours and sell at a lower price. If we fail to develop and launch successful new products or fail to reduce our cost structure to a competitive level, we may be unable to grow our business and compete successfully.\nWe must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. With respect to the battery category, we have been assessing volume and device trends in the battery category over the last several years, and although baseline emerging device and demographic trends combined with the stabilization of the device universe lead us to believe the long term outlook for category volume will be flat to slightly positive, there is no assurance this trend will continue. An increasing number of devices are using built-in battery systems, such as rechargeable hearing aids, particularly in developed markets, leading to potential declining volume trend in the battery category. Additionally, there could be a negative impact on the demand for primary batteries and could put additional pressure on results going forward, both directly through reduced consumption and indirectly as manufacturers aggressively price and promote their products to seek to retain market share or gain battery shelf space.\nOur business also depends on our ability to continue to manufacture our existing products to meet the applicable product performance claims we have made to our customers. Any decline in these standards could result in the loss of business and negatively impact our performance and financial results. Finally, our ability to maintain favorable margins on our products requires us to manage our manufacturing and other production costs relative to our prices. We may not be able to increase our prices in the event that our production costs increase, which would decrease our profit margins and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is currently conducted on a worldwide basis, with more than 40% of our sales in fiscal year 2019 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls;\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate foreign-based cash for strategic needs in the U.S., either at all or without incurring significant income tax and earnings consequences, as well as the heightened counterparty, internal control and country-specific risks associated with holding cash overseas;\n\u2022\nthe effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by a government authority without extended proceedings or at all;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in local investment, local employment, local training or exchange control regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on and taxation of international imports and exports;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions in certain economies, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate our ability to convert from local currency;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability, government nationalization of business or industries, government corruption and civil unrest, including political or economic instability in the countries of the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia, the Middle East and certain markets in Latin America;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory constraints, including tariffs and other trade barriers, including current uncertainty;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\na significant portion of our sales are denominated in local currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, and a high percentage of product costs for such sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, although we may hedge a portion of the exposure, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to such currencies can negatively impact our reported sales and operating profits.\nOur reliance on certain significant suppliers subjects us to numerous risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our operations depends in part upon our ability to acquire certain products in sufficient quantities. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production and thus delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. This could cause the Company to experience a reduction in sales, increased inventory levels and costs and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers. In some cases, we may have only one supplier for a product or service. Our dependence on single-source suppliers subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations, and possible litigation when we change vendors because of performance issues. Global economic factors and the weak economic recovery continue to put significant pressure on suppliers, with some suppliers facing financial distress and others attempting to rebuild profitability, all of which tends to make the supply environment more expensive. In addition, the content and enforcement of environmental, health and safety regulations have tightened in China, which has resulted in the closure of facilities without notice. The shutdown of one or more of our vendors could disrupt the supply of products necessary to our operations. If any of these vendors is unable to fulfill its obligations, or if we are unable to find replacement suppliers in the event of a supply disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which could materially harm our business.\nOur business is subject to increasing regulation in the U.S. and abroad.\nThe manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., including by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to advertising. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities. Legislation is continually being introduced in the United States and other countries, and new or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations are likely and could have an adverse impact on our business. Legislative and regulatory changes by taxing authorities have an impact on our effective tax rate, and we may be subject to additional costs arising from new or changed regulations, including those relating to health care and energy. Additionally, recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions and requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We are also subject to similar or even more restrictive anticorruption laws imposed by the governments of other countries where we do business, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the Brazil\nClean Company Act. We make sales and operate in countries known to experience corruption that are rated as high-risk nations. Our business activities in such countries create the risk of unauthorized conduct by one or more of our employees, customs brokers, freight forwarders, or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA or similar local regulations. In addition, we may be held liable for actions taken by such parties even though such parties are not subject to the FCPA or similar laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\nOutside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the European Union (the EU), as well as those of EU countries where we conduct business (including the U.K., Ireland, and France), which requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement and the safety of our products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees.\nWe are subject to privacy laws in the EU, including the new regulation that became effective in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including, for example, increased requirements to erase an individual\u2019s information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on service providers. The implementation of the GDPR may require substantial amendments to procedures and policies, and these changes could impact our business by increasing operational and compliance costs.\nAll of our company\u2019s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities.\u201d below.\nA finding that we are in violation of, or not in compliance with, applicable laws or regulations in the areas above, as well laws or regulations related to environmental issues, occupational safety, employment, competition/antitrust, anti-corruption, trade compliance, data privacy and other areas, could subject us to material civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions, product recalls, or criminal sanctions. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could jeopardize our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nA change in governmental regulations regarding the use of refrigerant gas R-134a or its potential future substitutes could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the auto care business to sell its aftermarket A/C products.\nThe refrigerant R-134a is a critical component of our auto care business\u2019 aftermarket A/C products. Older generation refrigerants such as R-12 (Freon) have been regulated for some time in the United States and elsewhere, due to concerns about their potential to contribute to ozone depletion. In recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a, which is an approved substitute for R-12, have also become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming.\nThe EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. In the United States, while such regulations are not currently in effect, the applicable regulations could be implemented and if so, depending on the scope and timing of the regulations, could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, regulations may be enacted governing the packaging, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants. For example, regulations are currently in effect in California that govern the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a. If the future use of R-134a is phased out or is limited or prohibited in jurisdictions in which we do business, or if substitutes for R-134a become widely used in A/C systems and their use for DIY and retrofit purposes is not approved by the EPA or other regulatory bodies, the future market for our auto care business' products containing R-134a may be limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, any alternatives to R-134a for use in the A/C systems of new vehicles will likely be at a higher cost than that of R-134a and access to supply may be limited. If an alternative becomes widely used, we may be unable to obtain sufficient supply or we may obtain supply at a cost that impacts our net sales and gross margins if we are unable to price products to reflect the increased cost of the alternatives.\nOur business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, our ability to forecast customer demand and our ability to manage production capacity.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our production capacity and on obtaining supplies, a number of which can only be obtained from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. A reduction or disruption in our production capacity or our supplies could delay products and fulfillment of orders and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe must accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. If we overestimate demand, we may experience underutilized capacity and excess inventory levels. If we underestimate demand, we may miss delivery deadlines and sales opportunities and incur additional costs for labor overtime, equipment overuse and logistical complexities. Additionally, our production capacity could be affected by manufacturing problems. Difficulties in the production process could reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result, we may not be able to deliver products on time or in a cost-effective, competitive manner. Our failure to adequately manage our capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to meet customer demand also depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials. In addition, a number of our raw materials are obtained from a single supplier. Many of our suppliers must undertake a time-consuming qualification process before we can incorporate their raw materials into our production process. If we are unable to obtain materials from a qualified supplier, it can take up to a year to qualify a new supplier, assuming an alternative source of supply is available. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among them to purchase products on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. Due to a number of factors, including (i) manufacturing lead-times, (ii) seasonal purchasing patterns and (iii) the potential for material price increases, we may be required to shorten our lead-time for production and more closely anticipate our retailers\u2019 and customers\u2019 demands, which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirements. This may increase the cost of warehousing inventory or result in excess inventory becoming difficult to manage, unusable or obsolete. In addition, if our retailers significantly change their inventory management strategies, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories, or may find that customers are cancelling orders or returning products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including some that are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal and external communications, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. These information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to the poor performance or failure of third party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events. If our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in conducting our business, which may adversely impact our operating results. In addition, we continuously assess and implement upgrades to improve our information technology systems globally. As such, during these implementation periods, we face a heightened risk of system interruptions and deficiencies or failures in our internal controls involving our information systems and processes.\nOur operations depend on the use of information technology systems that are subject to data privacy regulations, including recently effective European Union requirements, and could be the target of cyberattack.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company, employees, customers or consumers, as well as disrupt their and our operations or damage their and our facilities or those of third parties. Additionally, their and our systems are\nsubject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems. Laws and regulations in several countries restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, disclosure and security of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. Several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the countries of the EU and Canada, have laws and regulations which are often more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThe GDPR imposes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, increased requirements to erase an individual\u2019s information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on service providers. The implementation of the GDPR may require substantial amendments to procedures and policies, and these changes could impact our business by increasing operational and compliance costs. For example, we may be required to implement new technical and organizational measures to protect data from unauthorized access, revise their and our mechanisms of obtaining consent from EU data subjects, offer new controls to EU users with respect to their data (including by enabling them to exercise their rights to erasure and data portability) and devote additional resources to violation notification.\nA failure to comply with applicable regulations or an unauthorized breach or cyberattack could negatively impact our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs. In particular, the GDPR significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. Non-compliance could also damage the reputation of our company with retailer customers and consumers and diminish the strength and reputation of their and our brands, or require the payment of monetary penalties. We may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their or our systems or in order to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination that may expose it to material costs and liabilities.\nWe must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. A release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act or the presence of contamination that predates our ownership or operation of our facilities could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for contamination relating to our or their predecessors\u2019 current or former properties or any of their respective third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination can give rise to claims from governmental authorities or other third parties for natural resource damage, personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations at these or other properties or the assertion of tort claims related to such contamination could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenses and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations. As new laws and regulations are introduced, we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe resolution of our tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nSignificant estimation and judgment are required in determining our tax provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities and, although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. The unfavorable resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse impact on future operating results and our financial condition.\nChanges in production costs, including raw material prices, could erode our profit margins and negatively impact operating results.\nPricing and availability of raw materials, energy, shipping and other services needed for our business can be volatile due to general economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, import duties and tariffs and other factors beyond our control. There is no certainty that we will be able to offset future cost increases. This volatility can significantly affect our production cost and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control.\nOperations of our manufacturing and packaging facilities worldwide and of our corporate offices, and the methods we use to obtain supplies and to distribute our products, may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including availability of raw materials, work stoppages, industrial accidents, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality or safety issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, trade disputes between countries in which we have operations, such as the U.S. and China, and acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. The supply of our raw materials may be similarly disrupted. There is also a possibility that third-party manufacturers, which produce a significant portion of certain of our products, could discontinue production with little or no advance notice, or experience financial problems or problems with product quality or timeliness of product delivery, resulting in manufacturing delays or disruptions, regulatory sanctions, product liability claims or consumer complaints. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. We maintain business interruption insurance to potentially mitigate the impact of business interruption, but such coverage may not be sufficient to offset the financial or reputational impact of an interruption.\nIn addition, sales of certain of our products tend to be seasonal. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. If we are unable to accurately forecast and prepare for customer orders or our working capital needs, or there is a general downturn in business or economic conditions during these periods, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSales of certain of our products are seasonal and adverse weather conditions during our peak selling seasons for certain auto care products could have a material adverse effect.\nSales of certain of our auto care products tend to be seasonal. Historically, sales for certain auto care products typically have peaked during the first six months of the calendar year due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns and the timing of promotional activities. Purchases of our auto care products, especially our auto appearance and A/C recharge products, can be significantly impacted by unfavorable weather conditions during the summer period, and as a result we may suffer decreases in net sales if conditions are not favorable for use of our products. If adverse weather conditions during the first six months of the calendar year (the Company\u2019s second and third fiscal quarters) when demand for auto care products typically peaks persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of September 30, 2019, our total aggregate outstanding indebtedness was approximately $3.5 billion, with $370.2 million of additional capacity available under a senior secured revolving credit facility, inclusive of issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling $4.8 million.\nThis significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our shareholders, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt, thereby limiting the cash we have available to fund future growth opportunities, such as research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestrictive covenants in our debt arrangements which limit our operations and borrowing, and place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock;\n\u2022\nthe risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt or rising interest rates on our variable rate debt increasing future debt costs and limiting the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, due to the need to use our cash to service our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged with debt and that may therefore be able to invest more in their business or use their available cash to pursue other opportunities, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nDespite our high debt level, we may need additional financing in the future, which could exacerbate the risks of our substantial indebtedness, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities or require funding to make acquisitions. Although the indentures and credit agreements relating to our existing debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, none of the indentures or credit agreements relating to our existing debt will prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including, but not limited to, extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants. Generally, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, all of the risks described above in connection with our debt obligations could increase.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nThe vast majority of our total revenues are from products bearing proprietary trademarks and brand names. In addition, we own or license from third parties a number of patents, patent applications and other technology. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect or maintain our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. In addition, even if such rights are protected in the United States, the laws of some other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. If other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent on our ability to execute our business strategies successfully.\nOur products are currently marketed and sold through a dedicated commercial organization and exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers. As part of the separation from our former parent, we increased our use of exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers. We also decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries with large numbers of local and regional low-cost competitors in order to increase our profitability. In addition, we shifted from a decentralized management structure to a model in which many functions are managed centrally. We expect that these changes in our business strategy will enable us to reach new retail customers and consumers, and focus our business operations on more profitable markets. However, the use of distributors in markets where we have historically maintained a direct presence could adversely impact the reputation of our brands and negatively impact our results of operations. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to efficiently implement our strategies in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, achieve the goals of our long-term business strategies, or meet competitive challenges. If we are unable to execute our business strategies successfully, our revenues and marketability may be adversely affected.\nIf we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. Furthermore, if we sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public markets, the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. For one or more of these transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nincur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022\nincur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay; and\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the recent acquisitions of the global auto care business (Auto Acquisition) and Battery Acquisition (together with the Auto Acquisition, the Acquisitions).\nIn order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions, we have been and will continue to be required to devote significant management attention and resources to aligning the business practices, cultures and operations of the acquired businesses. We may encounter difficulties as we continue to align these businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the Acquisitions. Accordingly, the contemplated benefits of the Acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe successful integration of these Acquisitions depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating complex systems, operating procedures, compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets of the Acquisitions in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us because of the Acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the Acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the Acquisitions into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company and coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegration may be more costly, more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\nwe may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies. In addition, the success of the Acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the Acquisitions. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated\ngrowth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nThe benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Acquisitions depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and synergies due to cost reductions, alignment of purchase terms and logistics and pricing optimization. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the businesses and operations of the Acquisitions. Even if we successfully integrate the Acquisitions with our existing operations, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and annual run-rate synergies that we currently expect from this integration within the estimated three year anticipated time frame. For example, we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs, or could lose suppliers or customers if we fail to maintain our business relationships. Accordingly, the benefits from the Acquisitions may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the Acquisitions.\nThe Acquisitions may have liabilities that are not known to us and the Acquisition Agreements may not provide us with sufficient indemnification with respect to such liabilities.\nThe Acquisitions may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing Energizer\u2019s due diligence investigations of the Acquired Businesses. We cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the acquisition agreements in respect of the Acquisitions will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business of the Acquisitions or that the terms of the acquisition agreements will be complied with. We may learn additional information about the Acquisitions that materially adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully close the divestiture of the Divestment Business.\nOn May 29, 2019, we entered into an acquisition agreement with VARTA AG to divest the Divestment Business. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company will sell the Divestment Business for an aggregate purchase price of \u20ac180 million, subject to purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement with Spectrum for the Battery Acquisition, Spectrum will be contributing an additional US $200 million to Energizer in connection with the divestiture of the Divestment Business.\nDivestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, operations, facilities and employees to buyers;\n\u2022\nrequirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;\n\u2022\nchallenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain;\n\u2022\ninability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business;\n\u2022\nchallenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;\n\u2022\nability to reduce costs to achieve expected synergies for the rest of our business;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with transition services following the divestiture that result in material impacts to our ongoing operations;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees who leave our company as a result of a divestiture; and\n\u2022\nif customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, our other businesses may be adversely affected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business.\nWe and VARTA AG have agreed to enter into related agreements ancillary to the acquisition that will become effective upon the consummation of the acquisition, including a hearing aid battery supply agreement pursuant to which we will sell to VARTA AG hearing aid products bearing the Rayovac\u00ae trademark for sale by VARTA AG to retail customers in EMEA; an Alkaline Supply Agreement for the sale by VARTA AG to us during a transition period of certain alkaline battery products bearing the Varta\u00ae trademark; an agreement for the allocation and shared use of certain tools acquired by the Company from Spectrum; and a transition services agreement. VARTA AG will also become a party to the transition services agreement previously entered into between us and Spectrum on January 2, 2019 under which VARTA AG will provide to Spectrum that portion of the transition services currently provided by the Divestment Business. In addition, as part of the Acquisition, VARTA AG will acquire, indirectly through the acquisition of the Divestment Business, the Varta\u00ae brand globally and will, immediately following the closing date, enter into a license agreement with us under which we will receive a royalty-free license to use the Varta\u00ae brand in the non-EMEA territories for use in the consumer field (excluding sales to original equipment manufacturers) with the range of consumer product categories currently being sold by the Divestment Business under the Varta\u00ae brand consisting of certain consumer batteries,\nchargers, power banks and lighting products under the current Varta\u00ae trademarks and subbrands used today by the Divestment Business, as well as certain future Varta\u00ae marks. Subject to material compliance with its terms, the license granted to us is perpetual and exclusive within the specified field in all countries in the Non-EMEA territories where we currently sell Varta\u00ae branded products, and in respect of non-EMEA countries where we currently do not sell Varta\u00ae branded products, will also be exclusive unless after a specified period of time we do not reach certain sales thresholds in those countries, in which case the license will convert to non-exclusive in those territories where such thresholds are not achieved and will remain exclusive in all other territories.\nSeveral factors, including consumer perception, adverse events and publicity about the products marketed under the brand, VARTA AG's failure to maintain the quality of products sold under Varta\u00ae brand, VARTA AG's failure to properly prosecute intellectual property rights related to the brand, or supply shortages or other operational issues in countries where we do not operate, could diminish the value of this brand with varying degrees of significance, including in countries where we operate and use it. Additionally, the lack of control over the sales and distribution of the Rayovac-branded hearing aid batteries in such channel could result in reduced customer loyalty and awareness which could have an adverse impact on the value of the Rayovac brand and our future revenues. Further, the transition services agreement could result in an increased risk of potential disruption to our business from the failure by a party to provide services in a timely fashion.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in closing the divestiture of the Divestment Business, and such divestiture could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves the potential for claims of product liability and other tort claims against us, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and result in product recalls or withdrawals.\nWe face exposure to claims arising out of alleged defects in our products, including for property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance does not cover all types of claims, particularly claims that do not involve personal injury or property damage or claims that exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Further, we may not be able to maintain such insurance in sufficient amounts, on desirable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments not covered by insurance, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our products\u2019 reputation and in certain cases require a product recall. Product withdrawals or product liability claims, and any subsequent remedial actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand value, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel, including future members of our management team. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain and motivate our key employees or attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. Additionally, the escalating costs of offering and administering health care, retirement and other benefits for employees could result in reduced profitability.\nAs we continue to optimize our operations, the risk of potential employment-related claims and disputes will also increase. As such, we may be subject to claims, allegations or legal proceedings related to employment matters including discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination or retaliation, local, state, federal and non-U.S. labor law violations, injury, and wage violations. In addition, our employees in certain countries in Europe are subject to works council arrangements, exposing us to associated delays, works council claims and associated litigation. In the event we or our partners are subject to one or more employment-related claims, allegations or legal proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, losses or other liabilities in the defense, investigation, settlement, delays associated with, or other disposition of such claims. In addition to the economic impact, we may also suffer reputational harm as a result of such claims, allegations and legal proceedings and the investigation, defense and prosecution of such claims, allegations and legal proceedings could cause substantial disruption in our business and operations, including delaying and reducing the expected benefits of any operations\u2019 optimization. We have policies and procedures in place to reduce our exposure to these risks, but such policies and procedures may not be effective and we may be exposed to such claims, allegations or legal proceedings.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plans.\nWe assumed pension plan liabilities related to our current and former employees in connection with the separation. Effective January 1, 2014, the pension benefit earned to date by active participants under the legacy U.S. pension plan was frozen\nand future retirement service benefits are no longer accrued under this retirement program; however, our pension plan obligations remain significant. If the investment of plan assets does not provide the expected long-term returns, if interest rates or other assumptions change, or if governmental regulations change the timing or amounts of required contributions to the plans, we could be required to make significant additional pension contributions, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, our ability to comply with debt covenants and may require recognition of increased expense within our financial statements.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost of capital.\nWe expect that the major credit rating agencies will continue to evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings would be based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations and execution. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in Energizer, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive will impact our borrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms that will be advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that any credit ratings we receive will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if, in such rating agency\u2019s judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends or share repurchases on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders or repurchases of the Company\u2019s Common stock will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nThe Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of shares will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. The payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the preferential rights of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and other preferred stock that the Board may create from time to time. Our indentures and credit agreements relating to our debt also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders if we are in default, or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. In the event that any agreements governing any such debt restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common and preferred stock, we may be unable to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common or preferred stock unless we can repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under such agreements. Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend or repurchase shares in the future or continue to pay any dividend or conduct share repurchase programs.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock a liquidation preference equal to $100 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nHolders of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two directors in the case of certain dividend arrearages.\nIf dividends on any shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of our capital stock on a parity with our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations. This\nright to elect directors will dilute the representation of the holders of our common stock on our Board of Directors and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to January 15, 2022, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as described in the certificate of designation. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nYour percentage of ownership in Energizer may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Energizer may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. From time to time, we will issue additional stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more additional classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, as in the case of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, and of Missouri law, may deter or delay an acquisition of Energizer.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as \u201cMissouri law,\u201d contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover by making the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how we may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\na provision that our shareholders may only remove directors \u201cfor cause\u201d and with the approval of the holders of two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock at a special meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to opt out of coverage of Section 351.459 of Missouri law, which we refer to as the \u201cbusiness combination statute,\u201d these provisions could also deter or delay a change of control. The business combination statute restricts certain business combination transactions between us and an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d generally any person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or controls 20% or more of the outstanding shares of our voting stock, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the interested shareholder\u2019s acquisition of stock is approved by our Board on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status. The business combination statute also provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of such interested shareholder, approve the business combination or (ii) the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements.\nWe believe that these provisions will help to protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time\nto assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could deter or delay an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests or the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.", "PERMNO": 15400, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ENR"}
