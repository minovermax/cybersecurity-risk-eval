{"cik": "3453", "company": "Matson, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully. The Company\u2019s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material. The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation or stock price. All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company\u2019s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nRisks Related to the Jones Act\nRepeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were successful. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts to our business. In the past, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has suggested that the Jones Act should be a topic of trade negotiations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation protect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Company\u2019s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nChanges in economic conditions or governmental policies, including from the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and could in the future affect the Company.\nThe transportation industry in which the Company operates has been impacted by fluctuations, volatility, downturns, inflation, recessions and other economic shifts or market instabilities, as well as the development of and changes in governmental policies and relations, across the jurisdictions in which it operates. These adverse economic conditions may also impact customers\u2019 business levels and needs. Within the United States, a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, inflation, and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies may reduce the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, pressure from U.S. or foreign governments, imposition of tariffs and uncertainties regarding tariff rates or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company\u2019s China service.\nSince March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has harmed the U.S. and global economies, shut down or limited many business operations, led to port closures, and disrupted manufacturing, rail services, supply chains, travel, drayage of containers and transportation of goods for extended periods of time. In the United States and in many other countries worldwide, public health officials and state and local governments have recommended or mandated a range of precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants as they evolve and fluctuate in their global impacts. The full impact of such disruptions on the Company\u2019s business remains uncertain.\nThe pandemic and related uncertainties and restrictions have previously reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, including Hawaii, Guam and Alaska, and led to increased unemployment and weakened consumer demand in certain segments, including reduced demand for freight that the Company would otherwise carry in those tradelanes. Fluctuations in the price of oil and reduced demand from the decline in air or car travel in response to COVID-19 could further impact the Alaskan economy, which in turn could impact the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even after the pandemic has subsided.\nIn the Company\u2019s China service, as a result of the pandemic, the Company has experienced increased demand for its expedited ocean services. As the pandemic subsides, supply and demand trends normalize and supply chain congestion eases, the high volumes and rates the Company has experienced will eventually decline, but the Company cannot predict the timing or size of such decline. These declines will reduce revenues, but certain fixed costs will remain. For example, the Company cannot terminate leases early for chartered vessels in the CLX+ service.\nThe high volumes of freight from China and supply chain congestion at U.S. West Coast ports have contributed to an industry-wide shortage of containers and chassis, resulting broadly in delays, backlog, limited throughput, cancelled sailings, and service interruptions within tradelanes and supply chains, as well as long lead times for new equipment. There have also been labor shortages at U.S. ports related to record cargo volume, the overall employment environment and wage pressures, and outbreaks of COVID-19 which has also contributed to supply chain and port congestion. If the Company cannot secure sufficient equipment or labor, or unload vessels on a timely basis to meet customers\u2019 needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.\nThe Company\u2019s operations have also been impacted by the pandemic. The Company\u2019s employees are restricted in their ability to travel. The Company may be further impacted if its employees, including mariners aboard our vessels, are otherwise restricted from or unable to perform their duties, or if the Company\u2019s or SSAT\u2019s terminals are temporarily closed due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts in a timely manner or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards.\nDue to the continuing uncertainty around the duration, breadth and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences or mutations of the virus and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the\navailability, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, the ultimate impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows are difficult to predict with certainty at this time. Additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors.\nThe shipping industry is competitive, and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition.\nThe Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company\u2019s markets. The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry, especially in international tradelanes. Ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands. For example, in 2020 and 2021, in response to rising demand, several new carriers entered the China tradelane in competition with the Company\u2019s China service. The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company\u2019s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s volumes and rates.\nThe loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company\u2019s largest customers. The Company\u2019s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders and non-vessel owning common carriers, large retailers and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. For more information regarding the Company\u2019s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third party vendors such as railroads, truckers, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners. Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company\u2019s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services.\nThe loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and revenue.\nThe Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide terminal, rail, truck, and ocean transportation services. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers\u2019 needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis. If this were to occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAn increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nFuel is a significant operating expense for the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation business. The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services. In the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed a world-wide regulation generally requiring that all ships burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of less than or equal to 0.5 percent. Currently, LSFO is typically priced higher than HFO due to the need for further oil refinement. In some market instances, the prices between the two products could be inverted. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s contracts to secure LSFO or HFO on the U.S. West Coast will secure quantities in sufficient amounts and at a reasonable cost. In addition, prolonged use of LSFO on some\nMatson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs. The Company\u2019s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel-related surcharges, the availability of LSFO, and the potential impact on vessel performance may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, business and profit.\nEvolving stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters exposes the Company to heightened scrutiny, additional costs, operational challenges and a number of risks.\nInvestors, advisory firms, employees, customers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on, and establishing expectations for, ESG matters and related corporate practices, disclosures and initiatives. These evolving expectations may impact the Company\u2019s reputation, business and attractiveness as an investment, employer or business partner to the extent the Company - including its initiatives, goals and reporting - meets or is perceived to meet those expectations, including as a result of any third-party rating or assessment. The adoption and expansion of ESG-related legislation and regulation have also resulted and may again result in increased capital expenditures and compliance, operational and other costs to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s public disclosures on its climate, sustainability, human capital and other ESG initiatives include its goals or expectations with respect to those matters, including greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission reduction targets. These disclosures are aspirational and based on standards and frameworks for presenting and measuring progress that are not harmonized and are still developing, assumptions that may change, and disclosure controls and procedures that continue to evolve. The Company\u2019s initiatives and goals may not be favored by certain stakeholders and could impact the attraction and retention of investors, customers and employees, as well as the Company\u2019s willingness to do business with other companies or customers. Efforts to achieve the Company\u2019s initiatives and goals face numerous risks and may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays, and as a result may have a material negative impact on the Company, including its brand, reputation and stock price.\nThe Company may not be timely or successful in completing its fleet upgrade initiatives, which may result in significant costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet its climate goals.\nThe Company\u2019s four new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels include dual fuel capable engines that can run on LSFO or liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d). In November 2021, the Company announced plans to install tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on Daniel K. Inouye and to re-engine Manukai to operate on LNG. The Company also expects to begin LNG installations on Kaimana Hila, Lurline and Matsonia, and to build three new LNG-ready vessels. In addition, the Company is in the process of building a new neighbor island flat-deck barge. The Company anticipates making significant capital expenditures in connection with these fleet initiatives. These initiatives may be hindered by substantial delays and long lead times for necessary equipment, including as a result of ongoing supply chain congestion, other residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand across the industry for LNG installations and conversions, and new ship-building. Additional operating costs may be incurred to the extent additional ships are needed to maintain schedule integrity while such updates and installations are performed. Once completed, operation of these vessels may be slowed to the extent they present new maintenance requirements or unforeseen complications.\nUse of LNG fuel may not result in anticipated GHG emission reductions, and the Company\u2019s investments in LNG-ready vessels may be insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s previously announced GHG emission reduction goals on a timely basis or at all. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure LNG via bunker barges or other methods on the U.S. West Coast in sufficient amounts to fuel its vessels or at a reasonable cost, as increased demand for LNG could decrease available supply of LNG and increase prices. Governments have in the past and may again in the future impose tariffs on LNG that also may increase supply costs. As a result of these risks, the Company may not fully realize the benefits of these investments.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other physical and operating risks, including those arising from climate change.\nAs a maritime transportation company, the Company\u2019s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as rising temperatures, sea levels and storm severity, bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap. Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events. Such events interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events. In addition, severe weather\nand natural disasters can result in interference with the Company\u2019s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes. These impacts could be particularly acute in certain ports in Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane. The Company\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, increased maintenance expense, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution, or the slow down or suspension of operations. These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer. Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.\nThe Company\u2019s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured. In some cases, the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.\nThe Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change.\nThe Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change and the global shift toward a low carbon future. Organizational, industrial and governmental shifts in operations as well as legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or eliminate emissions and/or increase efficiency may require the Company to increase expenditures, make changes to existing infrastructure, vessels and equipment and shift its business model. For example, the maritime industry is moving toward deployment of clean energy technologies and use of electricity powered by renewable energy sources to power terminal operations as a way to reduce shoreside greenhouse gas emissions. As the Company and SSAT increase their reliance on the power grid at terminals, including for cold-ironing and ground service fleets, the Company may experience increased risks related to power outages, brown outs or black outs. The likelihood of these risks is compounded by uncertainties regarding the reliability of renewable energy sources as well as any increased frequency of extreme weather events that may disrupt the generation or transmission of electricity. In addition, compliance with new climate change requirements or regulations such as the IMO\u2019s requirements related to EEXI and CII could require Matson\u2019s fleet to slow down if efficiency improvements or transitions to alternative fuels together are not enough to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently, thus impacting Matson\u2019s expedited business model and competitive advantage. New environmental requirements for vessel performance and operation could also require the Company to accelerate the building of new vessels, increase the construction costs for new vessels and equipment to accommodate even newer technology as it emerges while today\u2019s technology becomes obsolete, initiate unexpected retrofit projects for existing vessels, retire older vessels earlier than expected, or render reserve vessels unusable. If these outcomes were to occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises). Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced when they expire.\nThe significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in the future and may\nnot be replaced with comparable assets with the specifications necessary for the Company\u2019s or SSAT\u2019s businesses or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels.\nThe Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time. The Company also operates a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance. The cost of repairs is difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.\nThe Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;\n\u25cf Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;\n\u25cf Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and\n\u25cf Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.\nIn addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast. The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.\nMatson\u2019s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:\n\u25cf Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;\n\u25cf Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf Political and economic instability; and\n\u25cf Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs or other governmental actions.\nThe Company\u2019s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization.\nThe Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor. Significant additional upgrades and projects remain. The Company has also continued discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities. Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact\non the Company\u2019s business plans, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns.\nHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and profitability.\nWar, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company. Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company\u2019s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson\u2019s vessels for military operation. Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company\u2019s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (\u201cHorizon\u201d) in 2015 and Span Intermediate, LLC (\u201cSpan Alaska\u201d) in 2016. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company\u2019s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.\nRisks Related to Employees\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company\u2019s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nA significant portion of Matson\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties, including SSAT, which employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report.\nThe Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices. Strikes, slow-downs and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.\nIn addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls, have had and in the future, particularly in years when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could have an adverse impact on Matson\u2019s or SSAT\u2019s operations.\nLoss of the Company\u2019s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners. The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future operating results because of such employees\u2019 experience with and knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and customer relationships. If key personnel and skilled employees depart or are unable to work, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business model could be impaired to the extent it cannot replace such personnel or sufficiently train new personnel in a timely manner. In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to replace these employees. Whether the\nCompany can meet its labor needs is subject to a variety of pressures, including market compensation and benefit levels, which may be impacted by pressure within the industry to increase wages, including due to the threat of a labor strike; the availability of labor, which may be impacted by national and global labor trends including higher-than-normal levels of individuals leaving the workforce during COVID-19 and industry trends including aging workforces that may reduce the available pool of skilled workers; a mismatch of skills or experience to support the evolving needs of the Company\u2019s business; and employee expectations or desire for changes in the work environment. In addition, the Company\u2019s workforce is aging, and within the next few years an increasing number of employees will be eligible to retire, which may result in a period of higher turnover rates than we have historically experienced and could amplify these challenges. The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital and maintain a desirable workplace culture, including to create a safe and healthy work environment, improve diversity and create a respectful, responsive and inclusive culture, and foster a rewarding workplace for employee development and advancement, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel. These efforts and the Company\u2019s reputation may also be impacted by any failure or perceived failure to meet or timely progress on publicly disclosed human capital-related goals and initiatives, including with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion, or to compare favorably with the progress or goals of its industry or peers. In addition, the Company may be subject to federal, state or local vaccine or other COVID-19 related mandates (including as a U.S. government contractor) and enforcement of such mandates may result in reputational harm, labor disruption and increased operating costs and impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified talent, among other risks.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nIf the Company is not able to use its information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively. The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption. There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet the Company\u2019s current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed. For example, the Company recently completed a multi-year process to implement a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system intended to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of its business operations. System enhancements are on-going.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers. The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers. In the past, disruptions in the Company\u2019s third-party service providers have impacted the Company\u2019s operations, including the Company\u2019s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations. During periods where government and health officials recommended or required doing so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the Company\u2019s employees worked from home or remotely, increasing the Company\u2019s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers during that time. If the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company\u2019s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.\nDespite the Company\u2019s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company\u2019s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company\u2019s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company\u2019s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company\u2019s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity risks, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations.\nAny failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems or those of third-parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nThe Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Span Alaska acquisition become impaired.\nThe Company recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill, customer relationships and trade name arising from the Span Alaska acquisition. The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting segment\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.\nA deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.\nDeterioration in the Company\u2019s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company\u2019s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as may be the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s announced plans to increase interest rates in 2022, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations. In addition, the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility is tied to LIBOR. Regulators in the United States and other countries have begun to phase out the use of LIBOR, with a complete phase out of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates currently expected by June 2023. Uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could pose funding risks for the Company and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financing costs. Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other macroeconomic or financial market developments could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and limit the Company\u2019s access to capital.\nFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company\u2019s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt, certain prohibitions on sale and leaseback transactions, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders\u2019 equity. If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company\u2019s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The Company\u2019s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate may vary.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (\u201cCCF\u201d) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; changes to the allowable amounts of foreign derived intangible income deductions; and acquisitions and changes in the Company\u2019s corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe amount of the Company\u2019s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding. These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThe Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company\u2019s employees.\nThe Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report). Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nAs an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company\u2019s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.\nThe Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates. In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; use of shore power at California ports; wastewater discharges; management of storm water; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to greenhouse gas emissions, such as a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits, and energy use. Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement, interpretation or implementation that results in more stringent requirements than currently anticipated, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to operate. Mitigation strategies or contingency plans to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays. Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers. For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company\u2019s business. In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. For example, Matson\u2019s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company\u2019s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained \u201cin class\u201d and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies. They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard. The Company\u2019s vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed. The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\nThese laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements). Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.\nThe Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental, shore power and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson\u2019s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.\nThe Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition.\nThe Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015. The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPasha acquired Horizon\u2019s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon\u2019s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants. In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.", "PERMNO": 11691, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "MATX"}
