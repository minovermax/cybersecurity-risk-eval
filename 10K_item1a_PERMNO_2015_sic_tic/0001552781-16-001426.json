{"cik": "1178409", "company": "TIDELANDS BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks, or other risks that have not been identified or which we believe are immaterial or unlikely. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nWe are in default under the Indentures governing our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities. As a result, the trustee has sent us notices of default declaring all principal and accrued interest, totaling $18.2 million at December 30, 2015, due and payable. The trustee is evaluating all courses of action as a result of the events of default, and we could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy.\nWe supported our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from two special purpose trusts and an accompanying sale of $14.4 million of junior subordinated debentures to these trusts. We conditionally guaranteed payment of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts.\n\tSince December 30, 2010, we began exercising our right to defer all quarterly distributions on our junior subordinated debentures. We were permitted to defer these interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods, although interest continued to accrue on the junior subordinated debentures and interest on such deferred interest also accrued and compounded quarterly from the date such deferred interest would have been payable were it not for the extension period. However, all of the deferred interest, including interest accrued on such deferred interest, became due and payable at the end of the deferral period, which was on December 30, 2015. We did not pay such deferred interest at the end of the permitted deferral period, constituting an event of default under the Indentures. As a result, on March 8, 2016, we received notices of default from the trustee related to the junior subordinated debentures accelerating all principal and accrued interest and demanding payment of all such amounts from the Company. At December 30, 2015, the aggregate principal amount of the junior subordinated debentures plus all accrued interest was $18.2 million. We will not be able to pay this amount if we are not able to raise additional capital. Even if we succeed in raising this capital, we will have to be released from the FRB Agreement or obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond to make such a payment. The trustee is evaluating all courses of action as a result of the events of default, and we could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. \t\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have prepared our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report assuming that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. However, due to our financial results, and the other regulatory and other matters discussed herein, management continues to assess a number of factors including liquidity, capital, and profitability that affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, then our common shareholders will likely lose all of their investment in the Company, and the holders of our Series T Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP program and our trust preferred securities, may lose all, or a material portion of, their investments.\nWe have an immediate need to raise a material amount of additional capital. We have been trying to raise additional capital or find a merger partner for several years, with no success, and there are no assurances that we will be able to do so.\nWe have been seeking to raise additional capital or find a merger partner since the imposition of the Consent Order, and we are continuing to work diligently to do so. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. In addition, we have found it particularly difficult to attract investors given the amount of our outstanding senior equity, including the Series T Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP program and the trust preferred securities that we have issued. At December 31, 2015, the amount of these outstanding senior securities was $20.1 million. Under Federal Reserve policy, any new capital issued by the Company will need to be common stock, which will be subordinate to these senior securities. Accordingly, it will be difficult for us to raise the additional capital that we need, even if we are able to negotiate reduced payments to these senior securities holders. If we are successful in raising additional capital, our existing shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership interests will be diluted significantly. If we cannot find a merger partner or raise additional capital to meet the Company\u2019s requirement to pay all principal and accrued interest on the junior subordinated debentures (which was recently accelerated by the trustee under the related Indentures), and meet the minimum capital requirements set forth under the Consent Order, or if we suffer a continued deterioration in our financial condition, we could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy by the trustee or the holders of the trust preferred securities, or we could be placed into a federal conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC. If this were to occur, then our common shareholders will likely lose all of their investment in the Company, and the holders of our Series T Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP program and our trust preferred securities, may lose all, or a material portion of, their investments.\nWe are subject to a Consent Order that requires us to take certain actions.\nOn June 1, 2010, the FDIC and the State Board conducted their annual joint examination of the Bank. As a result of the examination, the Bank entered into a Consent Order, effective December 28, 2010, with the FDIC and the State Board, which contains, among other things, a requirement that our bank achieve and maintain minimum capital requirements that exceed the minimum regulatory capital ratios for \u201cwell capitalized\u201d banks. Under this enforcement action, the Bank may no longer accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. In addition, under the Consent Order, we are required to obtain FDIC approval before making certain payments to departing executives and before adding new directors or senior executives. Our regulators have considerable discretion in whether to grant required approvals, and no assurance can be given that such approvals would be forthcoming. In addition, we are required to take certain other actions in the areas of capital, liquidity, asset quality, and interest rate risk management, as well as to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the State Board regarding our progress in complying with the Consent Order. Any material failure to comply with the terms of the Consent Order could result in further enforcement action by the FDIC. While we intend to take such actions as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the Consent Order and subsequent FDIC guidance, to date, the Bank has failed to meet all of the requirements in the Consent Order, including the minimum capital requirements. For additional discussion of the Consent Order, please refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial and Regulatory Developments\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report.\nTidelands Bank may become subject to a federal conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC if it cannot comply with the Consent Order, or if its condition continues to deteriorate.\nAs noted above, the Bank executed a Consent Order with the FDIC and the State Board. The Consent Order requires the Bank to, among other things, implement a plan to achieve and maintain minimum capital requirements. The Bank is not currently in compliance with these minimum capital requirements. In addition, the condition of our loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate and thus continue to deplete our capital and other financial resources. Should we fail to achieve compliance with the capital requirements in the Consent Order, or suffer a continued deterioration in our financial condition, we may be subject to being placed into a federal conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC, with the FDIC appointed as conservator or receiver. If these events occur, we probably would suffer a complete loss of the value of our ownership interest in the Bank, and we subsequently may be exposed to significant claims by the FDIC. Federal conservatorship or receivership would also result in a complete loss of your investment.\nMarket conditions in our markets and economic trends may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nOur business has been directly affected by market conditions, industry trends, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. The ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has been greatly reduced in recent years. Difficult market conditions and the tightening of credit can lead to increased deficiencies in our loan portfolio and increased market volatility.\nOur future success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in the Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head markets. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the markets in which we operate do not grow as anticipated, our business could be negatively impacted.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively affect the real estate market could hurt our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 78.2% of our loans were secured by real estate mortgages. The real estate collateral for these loans provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability, asset quality and ultimately our capital levels. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and shareholder\u2019s equity could be adversely affected. Acts of nature, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction lending.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction lending usually involve higher credit risks than that of single-family residential lending. As of December 31, 2015, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio: commercial real estate - 47.6%, commercial and industrial - 7.4%, residential construction - 8.6%, and commercial construction - 4.6%. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nCommercial and industrial loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the collateral securing the loans have the following characteristics: (a) they depreciate over time, (b) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (c) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing, and the builder\u2019s ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our outstanding commercial real estate loans were equal to 399% of our total capital. The banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for loan losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, or if credit delinquencies increase, our losses could increase.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans, that the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to assure repayment, and that we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining loan balances. The risk of loss varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, for many of our loans, the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio after considering these and other factors. Based in part on those assumptions and judgments, we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the allowance, we also rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information, including the results of external loan reviews. Despite our efforts, our loan assessment techniques may fail to properly account for potential loan losses, and, as a result, our established loan loss reserves may prove insufficient. If we are unable to generate income to compensate for these losses, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Higher charge-off rates and an increase in our allowance for loan losses may hurt our overall financial performance and may increase our cost of funds. As of December 31, 2015, we had 19 loans on nonaccrual status totaling approximately $7.7 million, and our allowance for loan loss was $4.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $1.2 million as a provision for loan losses, compared to $71,000 in 2014. Our current and future allowances for loan losses may not be adequate to cover future loan losses given current and future market conditions.\nInstitution-specific and/or broader industry-wide events may trigger a reduction in the availability of funding needed for day-to-day operations, resulting in a liquidity crisis.\nWe require a certain level of available funding each day to meet the liquidity demands of our operations. These demands include funding for new loan production, funding available for customer withdrawal requests and maturing time deposits not being renewed, and funding for settlement of investment portfolio transactions. Both institution specific events such as deterioration in our credit ratings resulting from a weakened capital position or from lack of earnings and industry-wide events such as a collapse of credit markets may result in a reduction of available funding sources sufficient to cover the liquidity demands. Such a crisis could significantly jeopardize our ability to continue operations.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic recession or other economic problems, including those affecting our South Carolina markets, but also those affecting the U.S. or world economies, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services. Since the conclusion of the last recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. If economic conditions deteriorate, or if there are negative developments affecting the domestic and international credit markets, the value of our loans and investments may be harmed, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is not listed for trading on any national securities exchange and, therefore, there is a limited public trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is not listed for trading on any national securities exchange, and we presently do not intend to apply to list our common stock on any national securities exchange at any time in the foreseeable future. Our stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol \u201cTDBK \u201c. Trading of securities on the OTC market is generally limited and is effected on a less regular basis than other exchanges, such as NASDAQ or the NYSE. Consequently, the liquidity of our common stock and our investors\u2019 ability to sell shares of our common stock may be limited. This limited market may restrict our investors\u2019 ability to sell shares of our common stock at a desirable or stable price , or at all, at any one time.\nBecause of our participation in the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Capital Purchase Program (\u201cCPP\u201d), we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives and other employees.\nIn December 2008, as part of the Capital Purchase Program established by the U.S. Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, we entered into a Letter Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement with Treasury (collectively, the \u201cCPP Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which we issued and sold to Treasury (i) 14,448 shares of our Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series T (the \u201cSeries T Preferred Stock\u201d), and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 571,821 shares of our common stock (the \u201cCPP Warrant\u201d) with an initial exercise price of $3.79 per share. Under the terms of the CPP Purchase Agreement between us and the Treasury, we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the Treasury holds the equity we issued or may issue to the Treasury, including the common stock we may issue under the CPP Warrant. These standards generally apply to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers. The standards include (1) ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution; (2) required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive and the next 20 most highly compensated employees based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives and the next five most highly compensated employees; and (4) agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive. In particular, the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods and may make it more difficult to attract suitable candidates to serve as executive officers.\nLegislation or regulatory changes could cause us to seek to repurchase the Series T preferred stock and CPP warrant that we sold to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program.\nLegislation and regulation that have been adopted after we closed on our sale of Series T Preferred Stock and the CPP warrant to the U.S. Treasury for $14.4 million under the CPP on December 19, 2008, or any legislation or regulations that may be implemented in the future, may have a material effect on the terms of our CPP transaction with the Treasury. If we determine that any such legislation or any regulations alter the terms of our CPP transaction with the Treasury in ways that we believe are adverse to our ability to effectively manage our business, then we may seek to unwind, in whole or in part, the CPP transaction by repurchasing some or all of the Series T preferred stock or CPP warrant that we sold to the U.S. Treasury. If we were to repurchase all or a portion of the Series T preferred stock or CPP warrant, then our capital levels could be materially reduced.\nA large percentage of the loans in our portfolio currently include exceptions to our loan policies and supervisory guidelines.\nAll of the loans that we make are subject to written loan policies adopted by our board of directors and to supervisory guidelines imposed by our regulators. Our loan policies are designed to reduce the risks associated with the loans that we make by requiring our loan officers, before closing a loan, to take certain steps that vary depending on the type and amount of the loan. These steps include making sure the proper liens are documented and perfected on property securing a loan, and requiring proof of adequate insurance coverage on property securing loans. Loans that do not fully comply with our loan policies are known as \u201cexceptions.\u201d We generally underwrite the loans in our portfolio in accordance with our own internal underwriting guidelines and regulatory supervisory guidelines. We categorize exceptions as policy exceptions, financial statement exceptions and collateral exceptions. Interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies allow institutions to originate loans in excess of the supervisory loan to value limits; however, the aggregate amount of such loans should not exceed 100% of total capital.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately $68.0 million of our loans, or 228.5% of our bank\u2019s capital, had loan-to-value ratios that exceeded regulatory supervisory guidelines. In addition, supervisory limits on commercial loan to value exceptions are set at 30% of a bank\u2019s capital. At December 31, 2015, $45.4 million of our commercial loans, or 152.5% of our bank\u2019s capital, exceeded the supervisory loan to value ratio. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 8.5% of the loans in our portfolio included collateral exceptions to our loan policies. As a result of these exceptions, those loans may have a higher risk of loss than the other loans in our portfolio that fully comply with our loan policies. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory action by federal or state banking authorities if they believe the number of exceptions in our loan portfolio represents an unsafe banking practice.\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates, recent developments in the credit and real estate markets and competition in our primary market area.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings significantly depend upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and net income.\nInterest rates remained steady for 2015 and 2014 with only one increase of 25 basis points in December of 2015. Approximately 28.3% of our loans were variable rate loans at December 31, 2015. The interest rates on a significant segment of these loans decrease when the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. However the interest that we earn on our assets may not change in the same amount or at the same rates as the interest rates we must pay on our sources of funds. Accordingly, increases in interest rates may reduce our net interest income due to increasing costs of funds. In addition, an increase in interest rates may decrease the demand for loans. Furthermore, increases in interest rates will add to the expenses of our borrowers, which may adversely affect their ability to repay their loans with us.\nAn increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in interest rates could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods. This reduction in net interest income may also be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market areas. Any significant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher FDIC Deposit Insurance premiums and assessments that we are required to pay could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay our liabilities as they come due.\nAlthough we cannot predict what the FDIC insurance assessment rates will be in the future, further deterioration in either risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nThe goal of liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this goal, our asset/liability committee establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding sources.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans, issuance of additional equity securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities and with terms acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that impact us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, a change in our status from well-capitalized to adequately capitalized, or regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets and negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nTraditionally, the primary sources of funds of our bank subsidiary have been customer deposits and loan repayments. Due to the Consent Order, we may not accept brokered deposits unless a waiver is granted by the FDIC. Although we currently do not utilize brokered deposits as a funding source, if we were to seek to use such funding source, there is no assurance that the FDIC will grant us the approval, when requested. These restrictions could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Additionally, we are restricted from offering an effective yield on deposits of more than 75 basis points over the national rates published by the FDIC weekly on their website. Secondary sources of liquidity may include proceeds from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. The Bank\u2019s credit risk rating at the FHLB has been negatively impacted, resulting in more restrictive borrowing requirements. Because we are adequately capitalized, we are required to pledge additional collateral for FHLB advances.\nWe actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances. We cannot provide assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal, and we diversify cash, due from banks, and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure relating to any one of these entities. We routinely review the financials of our counterparties as part of our risk management process. Balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. While we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the correspondent financial institutions fail.\nThere can be no assurance that our sources of funds will be adequate for our liquidity needs, and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. Specifically, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that additional borrowings, if sought, would be available to us or, if available, would be on favorable terms. Bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively impacted by the recent adverse economic conditions, as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. If additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe depend on key individuals, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in our markets. The loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely affect our prospects.\nThomas H. Lyles, our president and chief executive officer has contributed significantly to our business. If we lose the services of Mr. Lyles, he would be difficult to replace, and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo succeed in our markets, we must identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in these markets. We expect that competition for qualified management in our markets will be intense and that there will be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the community banking industry in these markets. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy requires both management and financial resources and is often lengthy. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage our offices effectively would limit our growth and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of the services of several key personnel could adversely affect our strategy and prospects to the extent we are unable to replace them.\nWe face strong competition for customers, which could prevent us from obtaining customers or may cause us to pay higher interest rates to attract customer deposits.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, this competitive industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services that we do not provide, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services. We also compete with local community banks in our market. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our market, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us.\nWe may not be able to compete with our larger competitors for larger customers because our lending limits are lower than theirs.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan a single borrower by the amount of the Bank\u2019s capital. Our legal lending limit is 15% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus, or $4.5 million at December 31, 2015. This is significantly less than the limit for our larger competitors and may affect our ability to seek relationships with larger businesses in our market areas. We expect to sell participations only on a limited basis going forward.\nWe will face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisitions or mergers.\nAlthough we do not have any current plans to do so, we may seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;\n\u00b7 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u00b7 diluting our existing shareholders in an acquisition;\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities before we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 taking a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u00b7 creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations; and\n\u00b7 losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nAlthough our management team has acquisition experience at other institutions, we have never acquired another institution before, so we lack experience as an organization in handling any of these risks. There is also a risk that any expansion effort will not be successful.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected because we are exposed to conditions or assumptions different from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which we summarize in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates about the future that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. For example, material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, the impact of current events, and conditions and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe costs of being an SEC registered company are proportionately higher for smaller companies like Tidelands Bancshares because of the requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. These regulations are applicable to our company. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increasing compliance costs, including costs related to internal controls, as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These necessary costs are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors.\nWe are exposed to the possibility that customers may prepay their loans to pay down loan balances, which could reduce our interest income and profitability.\nPrepayment rates stem from consumer behavior, conditions in the housing and financial markets, general United States economic conditions, and the relative interest rates on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Therefore, changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. Recognition of deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans are normally recognized over the contractual life of each loan. As prepayments occur, the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed will accelerate. The effect of the acceleration of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment penalties paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time. If prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty, the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated. We recognize premiums paid on mortgage-backed securities as an adjustment from interest income over the expected life of the security based on the rate of repayment of the securities. Acceleration of prepayments on the loans underlying a mortgage-backed security shortens the life of the security, increases the rate at which premiums are expensed and further reduces interest income. We may not be able to reinvest loan and security prepayments at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in a period of declining interest rates.\nGiven the geographic concentration of our operations, we could be significantly affected by any hurricane that affects coastal South Carolina.\nOur operations are concentrated in and our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of loans to persons and businesses located in coastal South Carolina. The collateral for many of our loans consists of real and personal property located in this area, which is susceptible to hurricanes that can cause extensive damage to the general region. Disaster conditions resulting from any hurricane that hits in this area would adversely affect the local economies and real estate markets, which could negatively impact our business. Adverse economic conditions resulting from such a disaster could also negatively affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and could reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans. Furthermore, damage resulting from any hurricane could also result in continued economic uncertainty that could negatively impact businesses in those areas. Consequently, our ability to continue to originate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local and regional economic conditions in this area following any hurricane.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. Although the full impact of the new requirements on our operations is unclear, the changes resulting from the Dodd Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities. The Dodd-Frank Act has required that we develop new and more extensive compliance policies and practices, and maintain higher capital and liquidity levels. These and other changes may adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make changes necessary to comply with these requirements at the expense of normal business operations. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws of regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and certain holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new regulatory capital rules based on the international standards, known as Basel III, that had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The new rules raised the risk-based capital requirements and revised the methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, usually resulting in higher risk weights. The new rules became effective as applied to the Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. Bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, are not subject to the Basel III rules.\nThe Basel III rules increase capital requirements and include two new capital measurements that will affect the Bank, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out of CET1 over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in additional Tier 1 capital, but not CET1. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nBeginning on January 1, 2015, the Bank\u2019s Basel III-based minimum risk-based capital requirements were (i) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement). The Bank\u2019s leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increased the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the former requirement of 100%. We will also be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. All changes to the risk weights took effect in full in 2015.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock is restricted.\nSince our inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through Tidelands Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock depends primarily on certain state and federal regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from Tidelands Bank. The ability of Tidelands Bank to pay cash dividends to us is currently prohibited by the restrictions of the Consent Order. In addition, we are currently prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends under the FRB Agreement, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. Also, as a result of the Company\u2019s deferral of dividend payments on our Series T Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the CPP and deferral of interest payments on our junior subordinated debtentures, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividends on its common stock until all deferred payments have been made in full.\nBanks and bank holding companies are also generally subject to certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. In addition, the Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice, if such dividends are not supported by recent earnings or we or our subsidiary bank do not, in the view of the regulators, have sufficient capital. The ability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to us is also limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other restrictions on its cash dividends that are applicable to South Carolina state banks and banks that are regulated by the FDIC. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we will be unable to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nThe Series T Preferred Stock impacts net income available to our common shareholders and earnings per common share, and the CPP Warrant we issued to the U.S. Treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nThe dividends declared on the Series T Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury through the Capital Purchase Program will reduce the net income available to common shareholders and our earnings per common share. Notably, because we did not redeem the Series T Preferred Stock prior to the fifth anniversary of the issuance date, the cost of this capital increased on May 15, 2014 from 5.0% per annum (approximately $722,000 annually) to 9.0% per annum (approximately $1.3 million annually). Also, we have been forced to defer and accrue quarterly dividend payments to the U.S. Treasury and, thus, as noted above, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock until all deferred dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock are paid in full. The Series T Preferred Stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nAdditionally, the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the CPP Warrant we issued to the U.S. Treasury in conjunction with the sale of the Series T Preferred Stock is exercised. The 571,821 shares of common stock underlying the CPP Warrant represent approximately 11.8% of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 21, 2016 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the CPP Warrant in total shares outstanding). Although Treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the CPP Warrant, a transferee of any portion of such warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of such warrant is not bound by this restriction.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, which may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf our competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, and terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As customer, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunication outages; natural disasters such as hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and as described below, cyber attacks.\nAs noted above, our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential information. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide service or security solutions for our operations, and other unaffiliated third parties could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.", "PERMNO": 91508, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TDBK"}
