RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors that may affect the Company\u2019s performance and results of operations include the following:\ni. the Company\u2019s business is dependent upon general economic conditions in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. The national and local economies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and results of operations;\nii. the Company\u2019s earnings depend, to a great extent, upon the level of net interest income generated by the Company, and therefore the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve;\niii. the banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the Company depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to attract loans and deposits in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, where the Company competes with a variety of traditional banking companies, some of which have vastly greater resources, and nontraditional institutions such as credit unions and finance companies;\niv. at December 31, 2019, approximately 65.9% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible factors, which are considered in making commercial loans;\nv. at December 31, 2019, approximately 27.9% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate and home equity loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk and the value of underlying collateral. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses, by loan defaults and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions;\nvi. economic conditions and interest rate risk could adversely impact the fair value and the ultimate collectibility of the Company\u2019s investments. Should an investment be deemed \u201cother than temporarily impaired\u201d, the Company would be required to write-down the carrying value of the investment through earnings. Such write-down(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations;\nvii. write-down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2019, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $2.7 million;\nviii. natural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to the Company\u2019s properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for the Company\u2019s loans and negatively affect the economies in which the Company operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business, and the Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest or pandemics, including COVID 19, could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business or the economy as a whole. While the Company has established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nix. changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing companies generally and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as the Act and the Tax Act, could alter the Company\u2019s business environment or affect the Company\u2019s operations;\nx. the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which the Company is highly dependent to secure bank and customer financial information, could present operational issues, require significant capital spending or impact the Company\u2019s reputation;\nxi. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position;\nxii. the Company\u2019s loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment or cover losses. If loan customers fail to repay loans according to the terms of the loans, the Company may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital ratios;\nxiii. the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. Any change in the laws or regulations or failure by the Company to comply with applicable law and regulation, or a change in regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the United States Congress, or the Massachusetts legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters, could also impact the Company\u2019s financial results; and\nThese factors, as well as general economic and market conditions in the United States of America, may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance, results of operations and the market price of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 11348, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CNBKA"}
