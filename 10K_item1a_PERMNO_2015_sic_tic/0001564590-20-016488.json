RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider and read carefully all the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, business prospects, stock price, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are analyzing and evaluating strategic alternatives to address our capital structure and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, undertaking or completing any strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will address our capital structure and not have a negative impact on our securityholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have initiated a process to analyze and evaluate various strategic alternatives to address our capital structure and to position us for future success. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. No decision has been made with respect to any strategic alternative and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, undertake and complete any strategic alternative that will address our capital structure and not have a negative impact on our securityholders or provide any guidance on the timing of such action, if any.\nAny potential strategic alternative would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control. We do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives until such time as we have determined that further disclosure is necessary or appropriate. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nAlthough our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, our management believes that our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, stockholders\u2019 deficit and other factors, including the recent significant decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020 due in part to failed OPEC negotiations and to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil and our inability to negotiate an extension of the maturity date for our senior loan facility, have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The going concern basis assumes that we will continue in operation for the next 12 months and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Thus, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, stockholders\u2019 deficit, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate negative cash flows from operating activities to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, the significant uncertainty in the outlook for oil and natural gas development as a result of the recent significant decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020 due in part to failed OPEC negotiations and to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil. We were recently notified that contracts to acquire seismic data offshore West Africa, valued at approximately $42 million, were terminated by the operator presumably due to uncertainty on government restrictions on operations during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. In addition, other scheduled and anticipated projects have been delayed and there is no assurance as to when they may resume, if at all. We are also unable to predict when industry market conditions may improve. Our senior loan facility matures in January 2021 and to date, we have been unable to negotiate an extension of the maturity date with our debt\nholders. If we are unable to extend or otherwise address the maturity date of the senior loan facility, we expect that we will be unable to repay the senior loan facility when due in January 2021.\nOur management continues to: (i) discuss with our debt holders an extension of the maturity date of the senior loan facility and waivers of the events of default due to the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; (ii) seek to obtain additional financing through the issuance of debt or equity securities; and (iii) manage operating costs by actively pursuing cost cutting measures to maximize liquidity consistent with current industry market expectations. There is no assurance that we will be successful in extending the maturity date of the senior loan facility or obtaining additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, there is no assurance that any such financing, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our needs and support our working capital needs. Based on the uncertainty of achieving these goals and the significance of the factors described, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months after the date our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we could have to liquidate our assets, and potentially realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and the holders of our securities could lose all or part of their investment. Accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including the global demand for oil and natural gas. A pandemic, including the COVID-19 coronavirus or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities, including quarantines of certain geographic areas, restrictions on travel and other restrictions that prohibit employees from going to work, both around the world as well as in certain jurisdictions in the United States. The continued spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the related mitigation measures may result in a significant decrease in business from our customers and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. For example, we were recently notified that contracts to acquire seismic data offshore West Africa, valued at approximately $42 million, were terminated by the operator presumably due to uncertainty on government restrictions on operations during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. In addition, other scheduled and anticipated projects have been delayed and there is no assurance as to when they may resume, if at all. If the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to spread or the response to contain the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business largely depends on the levels of exploration and development activity in the oil and natural gas industry, a historically cyclical industry. A decrease in this activity caused by low oil and natural gas prices, increased supply, and reduced demand, such as has occurred over the last several years, has had an adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nDemand for our services depends upon the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities which depend, in part, on oil and natural gas supplies and prices. The markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control. A decline in oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices, as has occurred over the last several years, has adversely affected the demand for our services and our results of operations.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas and our customers\u2019 desire to explore, develop and produce include:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves and the decline of existing oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of exploration and production companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration, development and production operations;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production and consumption;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies, including environmental regulations and tax policies, regarding the exploration for, production and development of oil and natural gas reserves, the use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources and climate change;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including large-scale weather events such as hurricanes that affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area or affect prices; and\n\u2022\nepidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.\nThe prolonged volatility and weakness in oil and natural gas prices has led many E&P companies to reduce their capital expenditures, which has resulted in diminished demand for our services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge or the level of work we do for our customers.\nThe price of oil has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2020, due in part to failed OPEC negotiations and to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil. We expect continued volatility in oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of exploration and development activities by our customers. Any significant decline in exploration or production-related spending by our customers, whether due to a decrease in the prices for oil and natural gas or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, increases in oil and natural gas prices may not increase demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur backlog can vary significantly from time to time. Our backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and thus may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $203.1 million of backlog under contract, in addition to approximately $348.6 million of bids outstanding. Of the $203.1 million of backlog under contract, we expect $127.1 million to be completed in 2020. Our backlog estimates represent those projects for which a customer has executed a contract or signed a binding letter of award. Our backlog can vary significantly from time to time, particularly if the backlog is made up of multi-year contracts with some of our more significant customers. Backlog estimates are based on a number of assumptions and estimates including assumptions related to foreign exchange rates and proportionate performance of contracts. The realization of our backlog estimates is further affected by our performance under term rate contracts, as the early or late completion of a project under term rate contracts will generally result in decreased or increased, as the case may be, revenues derived from those projects. Contracts for services are also occasionally modified by mutual consent and often can be terminated for convenience by the customer. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, and the possibility of early termination of customer contracts, we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be realized. Material modifications, delays, payment defaults or cancellations on the underlying contracts\n(including those modifications, delays, defaults and cancellations relating to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic) could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. Due the significant uncertainty in the outlook for oil and gas development as a result of the recent significant decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020 due in part to failed OPEC negotiations and to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil, certain of our scheduled and anticipated projects have recently been cancelled or delayed and there is no assurance as to when they may be reinitiated or awarded, if at all. We are unable to predict when market conditions may improve and worsening overall market conditions could result in reductions of backlog and bids outstanding.\nWe are currently in default under our debt instruments and if our efforts to negotiate waivers of those defaults are unsuccessful, our debt holders may seek to accelerate the maturity date of the applicable debt and exercise their other respective rights and remedies, such as foreclosure, among other things.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which results in events of default under our credit facility and our senior loan facility and a cross default under the indenture governing our 2023 Notes. As a result of such events of default, we are unable to borrow additional amounts under our credit facility without the requisite approval of the lenders under such credit facility. We have entered into forbearance agreements with respect to our credit facility, senior loan facility and 2023 Notes, whereby the holders of the indebtedness thereunder have agreed to refrain from exercising their rights and remedies with respect to these existing defaults and other events of default that have occurred and are continuing as further specified in the forbearance agreements until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the earlier of (i) May 31, 2020 and (ii) the date the forbearance agreements otherwise terminate in accordance with their terms. If we are unable to obtain waivers of the events of default, our debt holders may take action to accelerate the maturity date of the applicable debt and exercise their other respective rights and remedies, such as foreclosure, among other things. In addition, our debt holders may force us into bankruptcy or we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure and may have to liquidate our assets and in a liquidation may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements. Such events could result in the holders of our securities losing all or part of their investment.\nThe restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements relating to each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2015 through March 31, 2019 (collectively, the \u201cNon-Reliance Periods\u201d) may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor and counterparty confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nAs discussed in the \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d, \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and \u201cNote 3. Restatement of Previously Reported Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d and \u201cNote 24. Quarterly Data\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018 that was filed with the SEC on February 7, 2020, we restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods to correct accounting errors related to, among other items, our re-evaluation of our relationship with ASV and our determination that ASV is a related party VIE, that we had a controlling financial interest in ASV, and that we are the primary beneficiary of ASV, which, among other things, required us to consolidate the financial results of ASV.\nIn connection with this restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, we have also identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019. For a description of the material weaknesses and our management\u2019s implemented and planned remediations for those material weaknesses, please see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d contained herein.\nAs a result of the circumstances giving rise to the restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. The SEC and the DOJ are conducting investigations into, and we are subject to shareholder litigation related to, the circumstances giving rise to the restatement. In addition, the DOR is conducting an investigation with respect to our determination that ASV is a variable interest entity and related Alaska tax credit certificates. We could be subject to further regulatory, or shareholder or other actions in connection with the restatement in the future. The current SEC, DOJ and DOR investigations and shareholder litigation and any future proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation and could cause our counterparties to lose confidence in us. Each of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d contained herein, management has identified and evaluated the control deficiencies relating to revenue recognition, complex accounting and management estimates (including VIEs, earnings per share and income taxes), financial statement close and reporting, customer and vendor setup, approval and maintenance, related parties, segregation of duties, and information technology that gave rise to the accounting errors related to the financial results of ASV not being consolidated, and the control deficiencies relating to revenue recognition, earnings per share and income taxes that gave rise to additional unrelated material accounting errors, and has concluded that those deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of those material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.\nWe have developed and are in the process of implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses; however, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur undetected, and it is possible that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. If our remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, result in delays in meeting our reporting obligations, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe are involved in governmental investigations, which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties, as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition.\nAs previously disclosed, the SEC has been conducting an investigation of certain matters, including with respect to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, and tax credits. The DOJ is conducting a parallel investigation with the SEC. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the SEC and DOJ in their investigations. The SEC and DOJ investigations are continuing, and we are currently unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any potential SEC or DOJ legal action or other action or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.\nThe DOR is conducting an investigation with respect to our determination that ASV is a variable interest entity and related Alaska tax credit certificates. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the DOR investigation. The DOR investigation is continuing, and we are currently unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any potential DOR legal action or other action or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.\nIf we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal or state statutes, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. The imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows can be subject to fluctuations from period to period.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. Factors that cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for seismic data acquisition, processing or interpretation and customers\u2019 budgetary cycles, all of which are beyond our control. In addition, in any given period, we could have idle crews which result in a significant portion of our revenues, cash flows and earnings coming from a relatively small number of crews. Lower crew utilization rates can be caused by land access permit and weather delays, seasonal factors such as holiday schedules, shorter winter days or agricultural or hunting seasons, and crew repositioning and crew utilization and productivity. Additionally, due to location, type of service or particular project, some of our individual crews may achieve results that constitute a significant percentage of our consolidated operating results. Should any of our crews experience changes in timing or delays due to one or more of these factors, our financial results could be subject to significant variations from period to period. Combined with our fixed costs, these revenue fluctuations could also produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period.\nOil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition to the above potential fluctuations in our revenue, we may also have significant third-party pass-through costs that are reflected in our revenues but correspond to a very small administrative margin charged to the customer. Therefore, our revenues for certain periods may include a large amount of these third-party charges and can cause our gross profit margin to be lower.\nOur profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.\nOur profitability is determined, in part, by the prices we receive for our services, the productivity of our crews and the accuracy of our cost estimates. The productivity of our crews is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. In addition, cost estimates for our projects may be inadequate due to unknown factors associated with the work to be performed and market conditions, resulting in cost over-runs. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays, or if we have not correctly priced our services, our results of operation may vary and, in some cases, may be adversely affected.\nOur projects are performed on both a (i) turnkey basis, where a defined amount and scope of work is provided by us for a fixed price and additional work, which is subject to customer approval, is billed separately, and (ii) term basis, where work is provided by us for a fixed hourly, daily or monthly fee. The relative mix of turnkey and term agreements, as related to our projects, can vary widely from time to time. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a turnkey contract can vary from our estimated amount because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity from the original estimates, and the performance of subcontractors. In addition, if conditions exist on a particular project that were not anticipated in the customer contract, such as excessive weather delays, community issues, governmental issues or equipment failure, then the revenue timing and amount from a project can be affected substantially. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by weather delays and other hazards. Those variations, delays and risks inherent in billing customers at a fixed price may result in us experiencing reduced profitability or losses on projects.\nThe significant fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses.\nWe are subject to significant fixed operating costs, which primarily consist of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with our equipment, certain crew costs and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness. Extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays or other causes could negatively affect our results and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because we will not be able to reduce our fixed costs as fast as revenues decline.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to forecast and may vary significantly, which could cause liquidity issues and require us to seek additional financing that we may not be able to obtain on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict and can be subject to significant and rapid increases in our needs. Our available cash varies as a result of the timing of our projects, our customers\u2019 budgetary cycles and our receipt of payment. Our working capital requirements may continue to increase due to the expansion of infrastructure that may be required to keep pace with technological advances. In addition, some of our larger projects require significant upfront expenditures.\nOver time, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities, and we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2020 will not exceed $3.0 million. This amount will permit us to maintain the operational capability of our current fleet of equipment so that we can execute ongoing projects without delay or increased costs but will not allow us to purchase any new technology or upgrade existing capital assets.\nWe are in default under our credit facility, senior loan facility and 2023 Notes and, as a result, are unable to borrow additional amounts under our credit facility unless we obtain the requisite approval of the lenders under such credit facility. We cannot assure you that the lenders under our credit facility will approve or make any additional borrowings to us under our credit facility. As disclosed above, we have initiated a process to analyze and evaluate various strategic alternatives to address our capital structure. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, undertake and complete any strategic alternative that will address our capital structure and our anticipated working capital needs.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for at least twelve calendar months. There can be no assurance that we will be able to timely file such reports in the future. In addition, it is possible that the SEC in connection with their investigation of the facts surrounding our restatement could further prolong our inability to register securities for sale to the public on Form S-3. As a result, should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction timely and successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nWe face several risks regarding the monetization of tax credits under Alaska\u2019s tax credits program.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have a $12.1 million tax credits receivable, net of an allowance of $53.0 million, related to the tax credits earned by ASV. Following our sale of seismic data and related assets in January 2020, the balance of this receivable has been reduced to $2.7 million, net of an allowance of $27.7 million. We have classified this receivable as long-term because of the length of time we expect it will take to collect on it.\nFalling oil prices have substantially reduced Alaska\u2019s revenue from production taxes and other petroleum sources, resulting in appropriations to the oil and gas tax credit fund for purchase of tax credit certificates in the last several fiscal years at or below the amounts indicated by a statutory formula rather than amounts needed to pay for all the tax credit certificates in the queue for purchase. The Alaska budgets that passed in 2019 for fiscal year 2020, which started July 1, 2019, and in 2020 for fiscal year 2021, which starts July 1, 2020, had no appropriation to the oil and gas tax credit fund, but did include appropriations of an estimated $700 million for purchases of tax credit certificates through the bond program described below. According to statements made by DOR officials, that amount would be enough to pay for the outstanding tax credit certificates awaiting purchase by the State of Alaska. However, given the legal challenge to the bond program described below and the time it will take DOR to make purchases once the legal challenge is resolved, we do not anticipate that any purchases through the bond program will happen in fiscal year 2020. The fiscal year 2021 budget did not include an appropriation for debt service for the bond program, which will need to be addressed before the program will move forward.\nIn June 2018, Alaska passed legislation allowing Alaska to issue bonds to finance the purchase of up to $1.0 billion in tax credit certificates. If issued, Alaska will use the proceeds from the bonds to purchase tax credit certificates. Seismic companies will basically have two options from which to pick on a program-by-program basis. One option allows for the purchase of the tax credit certificates at a 10% discount rate based on the time Alaska would otherwise pay from the oil and gas tax credit fund under the statutory formula. The second option allows for the purchase of the tax credit certificates at a discount rate as low as the true interest costs plus 1.5% (estimated to be approximately 5.1%) but only if the seismic data is made publicly available earlier than the ten year confidentiality period that would otherwise apply. There are other options to obtain the lower discount rate, but those are less likely to be available to us as they require grant of an overriding royalty interest in an oil or gas property or a commitment to make capital investment in Alaska at or above the purchase amount within 24 months after purchase.\nWhile we continue to pursue other options to monetize the tax credit certificates, at this time we believe that the most likely path to monetize the tax credit certificates may be from proceeds that Alaska realizes from issuing its own bonds. This path has, however, complexities and risks. Although the Alaska Attorney General issued an opinion that the issuance of the bonds is not prohibited by the Alaska Constitution, a lawsuit was filed asserting constitutional challenges to Alaska\u2019s ability to issue the bonds. An Alaskan Superior Court judge dismissed the challenge to the constitutionality of the issuance of the bonds, and that ruling has been appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court. The DOR has indicated, however, that until the courts have resolved the legal issues, which we estimate may take at least several more months, it will not go into the bond markets.\nIn addition, the DOR is conducting an investigation with respect to our determination that ASV is a variable interest entity and related tax credit certificates. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the DOR. The DOR investigation is continuing, and we are currently unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any potential DOR legal action or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.\nAs a result of the above, we face several risks regarding the monetization of the tax credits. While we believe that we will get paid some amount of the tax credits, we cannot assure you when that will occur or how much. The longer it takes to monetize the tax credits, the more it could have a negative impact on our liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we do not manage growth and contractions in our business effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant growth but for the last several years we have contracted our business in response to the decline in oil and natural gas exploration activities. Both growth and contraction have placed significant demands on our personnel, management, infrastructure and support mechanisms and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of or contractions in our business. We may also expand through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage growth of or contractions in our business effectively, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.\nCompetition among seismic contractors historically has been, and likely will continue to be, intense. Competitive factors have in recent years included price, crew experience, asset availability and capacity, technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability. We also face increasing competition from nationally owned companies in various international jurisdictions that operate under less significant financial constraints than those we experience. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more customers, greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry than we do. They and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production levels, as well as changes in government regulations. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of protracted periods of months or years where seismic contractors under financial duress bid jobs at unattractive pricing levels and therefore adversely affect industry pricing. Competition from those and other competitors could result in downward pricing pressure, which could adversely affect our margins, and could result in the loss of market share.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process which can involve significant costs and risks. This effort may not result in awards of business, which could have adverse consequences on our future profitability.\nMany of our customers award business through a competitive bidding process, which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. This competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including the:\n\u2022\nsubstantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals;\n\u2022\nneed to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded; and\n\u2022\nopportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we may have otherwise pursued.\nEven if we are awarded contracts, we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract, or to resolve problems with our subcontractors or suppliers, which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us, particularly in the case of turnkey contracts. In addition, following the award of a contract, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer actions that are beyond our control.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in prior years. In 2019 and 2018, we generated net losses of $22.6 million and $59.6 million, respectively. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for seismic data acquisition services by E&P companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability.\nOur agreements with our customers may not adequately protect us from unforeseen events or address all issues that could arise with our customers. The occurrence of unforeseen events or disputes with customers could result in increased liability, costs and expenses for our projects.\nWe enter into master service agreements with many of our customers that allocate certain operational risks. Despite the inclusion of risk allocation provisions in our agreements, our operations may be affected by a number of events that are unforeseen or not within our control and our agreements may not adequately protect us from each possible event. If an event occurs which we have not contemplated or otherwise addressed in our agreement we, and not our customer, will likely bear the increased cost or liability.\nTo the extent our agreements do not adequately address those and other issues, or we are not able to successfully resolve resulting disputes, we may incur increased liability, costs and expenses. This may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate under hazardous conditions that subject us and our employees to risk of damage to property or personal injury and limitations on our insurance coverage may expose us to potentially significant liability costs.\nOur activities are often conducted in dangerous environments and include hazardous conditions, including operation of heavy equipment, the detonation of explosives, and operations in remote areas of developing countries. Operating in such environments, and under such conditions, carries with it inherent risks, such as loss of human life or equipment, as well as the risk of downtime or reduced productivity resulting from equipment failures caused by an adverse operating environment. Those risks could cause us to experience injuries to our personnel, equipment losses, and interruptions in our business.\nAlthough we maintain insurance, our insurance contains certain coverage exclusions and policy limits. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers as such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. A claim for which we are not fully insured, or which is excluded from coverage or exceeds the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, either in litigation or binding arbitration, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although we maintain insurance to cover litigation related claims, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nOur operations are subject to weather and seasonality, which may affect our ability to timely complete projects.\nOur seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors, often in difficult or harsh climate conditions, and are therefore subject to weather and seasonality. In Canada and Alaska, the primary season for seismic data acquisition is during the winter, as many areas are only accessible when the ground is frozen. The weather conditions during this time of year can affect the timing and efficiency of operations. In addition, this prime season can be shortened by warmer weather conditions. In South America and Southeast Asia, our operations are affected by the periods of heavy rain in the areas where seismic operations are conducted.\nIn all areas in which we operate, the weather is an uncontrollable factor that affects our operations at various times of the year. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, there may be times when adverse conditions may cause our operations to be delayed and result in additional costs and may negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.\nOur operations are subject to delays related to obtaining government permits and land access rights from third parties which could result in delays affecting our results of operations.\nOur seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining any required permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such permits and rights of way may negatively affect our results of operations, as has occurred with the recent federal government shutdown that delayed permitting on a proposed seismic shoot in Alaska.\nCapital requirements for the technology we use can be significant. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.\nSeismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this trend to continue. Manufacturers of seismic equipment may develop new systems that have competitive advantages relative to systems now in use that either render the equipment we currently use obsolete or require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we may need to continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities.\nOur capital requirements, which are primarily the cost of equipment, historically have been significant. We attempt to minimize our capital expenditures by restricting our purchase of equipment to equipment that we believe will remain highly utilized, and we strategically rent equipment utilizing the most current technology to cover peak periods in equipment demands. We may not be able to finance all our capital requirements, however, when and if needed, to acquire new equipment. If we are unable to do so, there may be a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Under our current business model, however, capital expenditures will be kept at minimum levels, other than for maintenance expenditures, until we see improvement in the market for seismic services. While we own or can rent the equipment needed for our current levels of business, long-term limiting our capital expenditures may result in an increased competitive disadvantage.\nA limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe derive our revenues from a relatively small number of E&P companies. Our largest customers can and typically do change from year to year and our largest customers in any one year may not be indicative of our largest customers in the future. If any of our customers were to terminate their contract with us on a large project or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties, as a result of concerns over our current cash flow and liquidity difficulties or for any other reason, and we were not able to replace their business with business from other customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.\nWe often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and consequently engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we generally obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of those subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, there can be no assurance we will not be held liable for the actions of those subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause damage or injury to our personnel and property that is not fully covered by insurance or by claims against the subcontractors.\nWe, along with our customers, are subject to compliance with governmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and may adversely affect the demand for our services.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, particularly those relating to emissions to air, discharges of water, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Those laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits before commencing regulated activities and the limitation or prohibition of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas.\nNumerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and analogous state agencies in the U.S. and governmental bodies with control over environmental matters in foreign jurisdictions, have the power to enforce compliance with those laws and regulations and any permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs and natural resource damage claims, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Further, we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high costs or other reasons. Our customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.\nWe expend financial and managerial resources to comply with all the laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulations, or that change waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The costs of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations are likely to increase over time and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with respect to existing or new laws and regulations or that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the operations of our customers which could affect demand for our services. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nIn addition, as a result of the mobility of our equipment, operations in foreign jurisdictions and the utilization of a multi-national work force, we and our customers are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions relating to the import or export of equipment and the immigration and employment of non-citizen employees or sub-contractors. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and analogous governmental bodies in foreign jurisdictions have laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict operations in certain jurisdictions and doing business with certain persons in such jurisdictions, and we and our customers may be required to obtain and maintain licenses, permits, visas and similar documentation for operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines and damages, criminal or civil sanctions for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations.\nCurrent and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change and hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and natural gas and adversely affect demand for our services.\nIn response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the federal, state and international levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs.\nThis increasing focus on global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our suppliers, customers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting, reporting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.\nThese legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete oil and natural gas wells. Shale natural gas and shale oil cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such initiatives are successful, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development. For example, environmental activists have recently challenged lease sales, seismic acquisition activities and decisions to grant air quality permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for offshore drilling and have challenged permitting and lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in governmental leasing permitting exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of government permits or land access rights;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\ndamaging publicity about us;\n\u2022\nincreased regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our services; and\n\u2022\nother adverse effects on our ability to provide our services.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. are subject to additional political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and our exposure to such risks will increase as we expand our international operations.\nOur operations outside of North America accounted for a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those operating in emerging markets. As we continue to increase our presence in those countries, our operations will continue to encounter the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ngovernment instability or armed conflict, which can cause our potential customers to withdraw or delay investment in capital projects, thereby reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to foreign currency, as described below;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation in certain foreign countries, which have significant negative effects on the economies of those countries and our operations in those countries;\n\u2022\nimport/export quotas or unexpected changes in regulatory environments and trade barriers;\n\u2022\ncivil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u2022\navailability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy, which limit the importation of qualified crew members or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient, and legal restrictions or other limitations on our ability to dismiss employees;\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, decrees and court decisions under legal systems that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs, as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel; and\n\u2022\nepidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nIf any of those or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and those examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we may experience project disruptions and losses, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations can be significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuations and regulations.\nA portion of our revenues is derived in the local currencies of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we are subject to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In the future, and especially as we further expand our operations in international markets, our customers may increasingly make payments in non-U.S. currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, operating costs and operating margins. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not actively traded. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks relating to governmental regulation of foreign currency, which may limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ntransfer funds from or convert currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\nrepatriate foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements; and\n\u2022\nrepatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates.\nAs we continue to develop our operations in foreign countries, there is an increased risk that foreign currency controls may create difficulty in repatriating profits from foreign countries in the form of taxes or other restrictions, which could restrict our cash flow.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated the FCPA or other such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and reputation.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nWe operate in certain parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. We could be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA cyber incident could result in loss or corruption of customer data or information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss that affects us.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on our information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to process and record our customers\u2019 seismic data, process our financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and for many other activities related to our business.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber-attacks, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial of service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of customer proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations, particularly if the incident affects our customers\u2019 data. Although to date we have not experienced any cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of cyber-attacks in the future or suffer such losses related to any cyber incident. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws affecting the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the scope of our international business operations, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of these operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences. We are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, intercompany loans and guarantees. If any applicable tax authorities, including the U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions and the imposition of tax, interest and penalties.\nOur continued success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur continued success depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key personnel. As a result of the circumstances giving rise to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, we have undergone a reorganization of our senior level management. Additional reorganization or the loss of additional senior level executives or key personnel could disrupt our operations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future, in which case our business may be severely disrupted.\nSignificant amounts of money were invested in acquiring and processing seismic data for the multiclient seismic data library maintained by ASV without knowing precisely how much of this seismic data will be able to be licensed or when and at what price such data will be licensed.\nSignificant amounts of money were invested in acquiring and processing seismic data for the multiclient seismic data library maintained by ASV. As a result, ASV is exposed to the following risks:\n\u2022\nASV may not fully recover the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data through future licensing of seismic data, as the amounts and timing of these data sales are unpredictable, can vary greatly from quarter to quarter and depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond ASV\u2019s control;\n\u2022\nthe amortization of the costs of these surveys will affect our earnings and, when combined with the sporadic nature of sales, will result in increased earnings volatility;\n\u2022\nregulatory and technological changes that affect companies\u2019 ability to drill, either generally or in a specific location covered by the acquired seismic data, could materially adversely affect the value of the seismic data contained in the library maintained by ASV; and\n\u2022\nthe value of the seismic data could be significantly adversely affected if any material adverse change occurs in the general prospects for oil and gas exploration, development and production activities.\nThe cyclical nature of the oil and natural gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity, have fluctuated significantly. These fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business. We are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and natural gas industry activity. Prolonged periods of low commodity prices depress development activity, adversely affecting the demand for our products and services, including the multiclient seismic data library maintained by ASV, and our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe requirements of being a public company increase our operating expenses and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations require us to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur if we were not a public company.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges, establish certain requirements for the corporate governance practices of public companies. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have additional board committees and are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management\u2019s attention has been and will continue to be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause we are a smaller reporting company, to date our independent registered public accounting firm has not been required to issue an attestation report regarding our internal control over financial reporting in the annual reports on Form 10-K that we file with the SEC, and we have been subject to scaled disclosure requirements. We will remain a smaller reporting company as long as of the end of our second fiscal quarter each year (i) the market value of our securities held by non-affiliates (\u201cpublic float\u201d) is below $250.0 million or (ii) we have annual revenues of less than $100.0 million and our public float is less than $700.0 million. If we cease to be a smaller reporting company, our expenses will further increase, and additional time will be required of our management to comply with those additional requirements.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have $134.0 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt (excluding finance leases) outstanding, of which $126.8 million in aggregate principal amount has been classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets due to events of default under our credit facility and our senior loan facility and a cross default under the indenture governing our 2023 Notes as described above. Our high level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other expenses or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets or engage in business combinations;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by a broad range of factors, including prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting us and our industry, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our existing and any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities or capital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future, subject to certain limitations, including debt under our credit facility if we obtain the requisite approval of the lenders under such credit facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nOur debt agreements impose or may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur debt agreements contain covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\nselling certain assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndeclaring or paying dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\nmaking certain investments;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nprepaying subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreating or incurring liens;\n\u2022\nagreeing to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengaging in a business other than our current business and businesses related, ancillary or complementary, to our current businesses or immaterial businesses; and\n\u2022\ndesignating certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our debt agreements restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from taking or omitting to take certain actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing our indebtedness.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements. The requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, additional events of default may occur under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, additional events of default may occur under the terms of those agreements. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by circumstances beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Without effective forbearance agreements, our debt holders may accelerate their respective loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Our debt agreements contain, and certain other contracts to which we are a party may also contain, cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions that may result in the underlying debt being accelerated and becoming due and payable.\nIf any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nPrices for our common stock may be volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nPrices of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, have been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors such as announcements concerning changes in prices of oil and natural gas, exploration and development activities, the availability of capital, our cash flow and liquidity situation and economic and other external factors, as well as quarterly or annual fluctuations in our financial results, may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock.\nThere are limited trading markets for our securities.\nFrom time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. There can be no assurance that there will continue to be an active trading market for our common stock or that any securities research analysts will provide research coverage on our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nIn addition, there is currently no market for, and we do not intend to list, our outstanding warrants on any securities exchange or any automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, there may not be development of, or liquidity in, any market for the warrants. If a market were to develop, the warrants could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than their initial price depending upon many factors, including the price of our common stock, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and markets for similar securities.\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among our largest stockholders and their affiliates.\nA small number of stockholders hold a majority of our common stock, warrants and 2023 Notes. These stockholders have influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial. Furthermore, these stockholders may sell their shares of common stock at any time. Such sales could be substantial and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt agreements to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nSignificant exercises of warrants or conversion of our 2023 Notes could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of April 6, 2020, we had approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock outstanding; however, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include approximately 5.7 million shares that may be issued upon the exercise of warrants (including warrants to be issued upon receipt of shareholder approval) or approximately 10.4 million shares issuable upon the conversion of our 2023 Notes. The exercise of warrants and the conversion of our 2023 Notes could adversely affect the price of our common stock, will reduce the percentage of common stock held by our current stockholders and may cause our current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently not in compliance with the NASDAQ Capital Market listing standards. If our common stock is delisted, the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). Continued listing of a security on NASDAQ is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards. On February 11, 2020, we received a notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from NASDAQ stating we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing because our stockholders\u2019 equity, as reported in our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019, was below the required minimum of $2.5 million.\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. On February 25, 2020, we submitted a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, and on March 10, 2020, we submitted requested follow-up information. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, NASDAQ may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice to evidence compliance (the \u201cCompliance Period\u201d).\nThere can be no assurance that our plan will be accepted or that if it is, we will be able to regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period. If our plan to regain compliance is not accepted, or if it is and we do not regain compliance during the Compliance Period, or if we fail to satisfy another NASDAQ requirement for continued listing, NASDAQ could provide notice that our common stock will become subject to delisting. In such event, NASDAQ rules would permit us to appeal the decision to reject our proposed plan to regain compliance or any delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel.\nIf our common stock was to be delisted from NASDAQ and was not otherwise listed or traded on another qualifying exchanges (such as the OTCQX Market or the OTCQB Market) for a period of five consecutive trading days, such event would constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the terms of the indentures governing our 2023 Notes. In such event, we would be required to provide notice to the holders of our 2023 Notes of such fundamental change and could be required, at the option of such holders, to repurchase all or a portion of their notes. A requirement by such holders for us to repurchase some or all of such notes for cash will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including if we do not have sufficient funds or are otherwise unable to comply with such requirement in accordance with the indenture governing our 2023 Notes.\nIf our common stock was to be delisted from NASDAQ, trading of our common stock most likely would be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the OTCQX Market, OTCQB Market or OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading would likely reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock. If our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low-priced stocks to their clients. Moreover, various regulations and policies restrict the ability of stockholders to borrow against or \u201cmargin\u201d low-priced stocks, and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls. Additionally, because brokers\u2019 commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks, the current price of the common stock can result in an individual stockholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher. This factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock. Finally, the additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock. As a result, the ability of our stockholders to resell their shares of common stock, and the price at which they could sell their shares, could be adversely affected. The delisting of our stock from NASDAQ would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.", "PERMNO": 13330, "SIC": 1382, "TIC": "SAEXQ"}
