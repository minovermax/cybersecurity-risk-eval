Risk Factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business, important risk factors that may affect us are discussed below. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also significantly impact or impair our business operations.\nRegulatory Compliance Risk\nProduct Approval and Monitoring\nMost countries where we sell medical devices subject our technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality. The global regulatory environment is increasingly unpredictable and stringent. Countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While there are efforts at some harmonization of global regulations, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect that as this global regulatory environment continues to evolve, it could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose significant compliance and monitoring obligations on our business.\nRegulatory approval delays due to COVID-19\nCOVID-19 may impede clinical trials and slow down regulatory actions. It could adversely affect the entire clinical trial spectrum from enrollment to data analysis. Assuming patients enroll, clinical trials may face disruptions to protocol schedules for treatment and follow-up visits. Reports from Europe have noted overwhelmed facilities where all non-critical visits have been postponed or canceled. Many U.S. hospitals have followed suit to limit exposure and allow for care of COVID-19 patients. Deviations from trial protocols could present challenges when it comes time to analyze the related data set. Some clinics may stop allowing clinical trial monitors on site. Without reconciling the data, we may be unable to \"lock\" the trial database, an essential step that precedes the analysis of the data.\nWe rely on regular interaction and guidance from the FDA and other regional/country regulatory authorities/agencies to plan research and development activities across all stages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA and worldwide regulatory authorities have a great deal of resources dedicated to COVID-19 related matters, resulting in disruption in their ability to fully support the regulatory clearance/approval processes. As resources continue to be diverted, regulatory clearances/approvals may continue to be delayed, until the pandemic is under control. Therefore, delays with approvals, clearances, inspections, and meetings that are currently being experienced may continue for the foreseeable future. Postponement of these interactions could delay us from bringing new products to market.\nWe are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nAs a part of the regulatory process for obtaining marketing clearance or approval for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or the market\u2019s or FDA\u2019s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:\n\u2022take a significant amount of time;\n\u2022require the expenditure of considerable resources;\n\u2022involve rigorous clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022involve modifications, repairs, corrections, or replacements of our products; and\n\u2022limit the proposed intended uses of our products.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nOn March 14, 2022, the FDA posted a Communication that warns consumers and health care providers against the use of our Advanced Energy products outside of their FDA-cleared indications for general use in cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. We continue to work with the FDA towards securing 510(k) clearance for additional indications. We are in the process of evaluating what effects, if any, the Communication will have on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nBefore and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, Australia, Brazil, EU, and other applicable world-wide government agency regulations. For instance, many of our processes and facilities, as well as those of our suppliers, are also subject to periodic audits to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these audits can include major inspectional observations, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement.\nIf the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such medical products, determine that our products are adulterated or misbranded, order a recall, repair, replacement, correction, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market clearances or approvals, refuse to issue export certificates for foreign governments, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.\nThe FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, the FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the cleared product labeling. Any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government. Governmental regulations worldwide have, and may continue to become, increasingly stringent and customary.\nIn the EU, a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the EU countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices, or \"EU MDR\", came into effect in May 2017, which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements.\nThe EU MDR represents the first major changes to the EU medical device regulatory environment, has significantly raised the compliance bar for the medical device industry, and will cause significant changes to the regulatory obligations of manufacturers, importers and distributors involved in the medical device distribution chain. Classification has changed for some product categories, and strict new requirements have been imposed on clinical data, risk management, post market surveillance, and supplier management. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license, and criminal sanctions. The regulation initially provided a three-year implementation period to May 2020, but that timeline was delayed to May 2021 due to COVID-19 and its impact on audits and technical file review by Notified Bodies. After that time, medical devices marketed in the EU will require certification according to these new requirements, except for devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, which can be placed in the market until May 2024.\nOutside of the EU, regulations vary significantly from country to country and are becoming increasingly stringent and country specific. Territories and countries around the world continue to develop their own unique regulatory requirements, and these individual governments are passing laws that enforce these new regulations, including imposing fees, to register products in their country. The time and effort required to obtain approval to market products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S. or the EU. Certain European countries outside of the EU, and other countries around the world do not recognize the CE mark certification or FDA clearance/approval and have their own regulatory requirements to register and sell products in these territories.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nEnvironmental Regulation\nThe medical device industry continues to be the subject of intense scrutiny and stringent regulation and the demand for green, sustainable products is rapidly increasing. There are increasing requirements for efficient and accurate processes for hazardous substance handling, supplier disclosures, and regulatory reporting in order to comply with numerous global health and environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive\n\u2022Packaging and Packing Waste Directive\n\u2022REACH Regulation\n\u2022Proposition 65\n\u2022Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide\nCompliance with existing and future environmental regulations may have an impact on the manufacturing and sterilization of our medical devices. Environmental regulations in the U.S. and EU limit or prohibit the use of certain chemicals, substances and materials in the manufacture of our medical devices such as Prop 65 in California and others in the EU such as REACH, RoHS, and WEEE Directive. With the current global concerns over climate change and the tangible effects human beings are having on the environment, there is no doubt that the amount of environmental legislation is primed to increase still further, with the EU being at the forefront of this movement.\nEthylene oxide (EtO) is used to sterilize approximately 50% of medical devices in the U.S. While some alternative methods currently exist, potential device incompatibility issues exist with these alternatives. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified EtO as a carcinogen after linking it to cases of breast cancer, lymphoma and leukemia. Currently, shortages due to current closures are not expected, but any additional commercial sterilization facility closures could result in shortages for certain devices. Our devices are not currently impacted by these closures, however, it is unknown if the current EtO facilities utilized by Apyx Medical could be impacted in the future.\nThe FDA is closely monitoring the supply chain effects of closures and potential closures of certain facilities that use EtO to sterilize medical devices prior to their use, and, is concerned about the future availability of sterile medical devices and the potential for medical device shortages that might impact patient care. However, they do not have oversight authority over EtO emissions, which is within the purview of the EPA.\nOur operations and those of certain third-party suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAnti-Corruption Regulation\nAs we grow our international presence and global operations, we will be increasingly exposed to statutes, anti-corruption trade policies, economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments and organizations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, other foreign statutes, such as the\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nU.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, and require training of our employees, management team and our global distributors on an annual basis. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures are or will be sufficient to prevent violations from occurring. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe manufacture the majority of our products at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. Components, labor-intensive assemblies and sub-assemblies, and sterilization services are outsourced to third parties and produced to our specifications.\nWe are also dependent on OEM customers who have no legal obligation to purchase products from us. Should such customers fail to give us purchase orders for products after development, our future business could be negatively affected. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such customers will give sufficient high priority to our products. Finally, disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our customers, which could adversely affect production and sales of our products.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with competitive advances in technology, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, our research and development efforts rely upon investments and alliances, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or alliances will be successful.\nOur research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop new and innovative products for introduction in the marketplace. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products, such as our Renuvion\u00ae/J-Plasma\u00ae technology, and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and areas of development.\nThese activities are primarily conducted internally and are expensed as incurred. Expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials, and services associated with the development of our products, net of any reimbursements from customers. Research and development expenses do not include any portion of general and administrative expenses. Our research and development activities are conducted at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. We expect to continue making future investments to enable us to develop and market new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing business. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments in both facilities will be successful or that our new products will gain market acceptance, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe amount expended by us on research and development of our products for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, totaled approximately $4.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively. We have invested substantial resources in the development and marketing of our Advanced Energy product technologies but have not incurred any direct costs relating to environmental regulations or requirements. For 2022, we expect to invest approximately 7% to 10% of revenue for research and development activities.\nEven if we are successful in developing new, or enhancing our existing products, there are various circumstances that could prevent their successful commercialization.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on a number of factors, any of which could delay or prevent commercialization, including:\n\u2022our inability to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for expanded indications, new products, or\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nproduct modifications;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022if our product is determined to be ineffective or unsafe following approval, and is removed from the market or we are required to perform additional research and development to further prove the safety and effectiveness of the product before re-entry into the market;\n\u2022if the regulatory approvals/clearances of our new products are delayed or denied, or we are required to conduct further research and development of our products prior to receiving regulatory approval;\n\u2022our inability to build and maintain a sales and marketing group to successfully launch and sell our new products;\n\u2022if we experience sudden or extreme volatility in commodity prices and availability, including supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022if we are required to allocate available funds to litigation matters;\n\u2022if the needs of our physicians or their patients are not sufficiently met;\n\u2022if we are unable to manufacture the quantity of products needed, in accordance with quality manufacturing standards, to meet market demand;\n\u2022competition from other products or technologies prevents or reduces market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022if we do not have, and cannot obtain, the intellectual property rights needed to manufacture or market our products without infringing on another company\u2019s patents; or\n\u2022if we are unsuccessful in defending against patent infringement, or other intellectual property rights claims, that could be brought against us, our products or technologies;\nThe failure to successfully commercialize our products will have a material and adverse effect on the future growth of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nWe have been issued 44 patents in the United States and 25 foreign patents. We have 14 pending patent applications in the United States and 51 pending foreign applications. Our intellectual property portfolio for our J-Plasma\u00ae/Renuvion\u00ae products continues to grow on an annual basis. We intend to continue to seek legal protection, primarily through patents, for our proprietary technology. Seeking patent protection is a lengthy and costly process and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending applications, or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad or strong to protect our proprietary technology. There is also no guarantee that any patents we hold will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the patent rights granted will provide competitive advantages to us. Our competitors have developed, and may continue to develop and obtain, patents for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nAdverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties on terms that may not be reasonable or favorable to us, prevent us from manufacturing, importing or selling our products, or compel us to redesign our products to avoid infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property. As a result, our product offerings may be delayed, and we may be unable to meet customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner. Regardless of the merit of any related legal proceeding, we have incurred in the past, and may be required to incur in the future, substantial costs to prosecute, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Even in the absence of infringement by our products on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or litigation related to trade secrets, we have elected in the past, and may in the future, elect to enter into settlements to avoid the costs and risks of protracted litigation and the diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. If the terms of settlements entered into with certain of our competitors are not observed or enforced, we may suffer further costs and risks. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to patent, copyright, and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our consultants, vendors, and our former or current employees. Despite these efforts, however, any of these parties may breach those agreements and disclose our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information, and once disclosed, we are likely to lose trade secret protection. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our trade secrets is difficult, and we\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\ncannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, our remedies may not be sufficient to cover our losses.\nIn 2020, the Coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and spread to the United States and many other parts of the world and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for an extended period of time.\nCOVID-19 continues to exist both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions may continue to adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its related variants, as the situation continues to evolve.\nFuture significant reductions in business-related activities could result in further loss of sales and profits, as well as other material adverse effects. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 worldwide on our business, financial results, liquidity and cash flows will depend largely on future developments, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and action taken to contain or prevent further spread and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAs COVID-19 continues and persists for an extended period of time, there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and delays in the manufacturing and shipment of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been, and may in the future, become subject to litigation proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, and we are and may become subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including claims by current or former employees, distributors and competitors, and with respect to our products and product liability claims, lawsuits and proceedings.\nWe are involved in a number of legal actions relating to the use of our technology. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In the opinion of management, the Company has meritorious defenses, and such claims are adequately covered by insurance, or are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, in the event that damages exceed the aggregate coverage limits of our policy, or if our insurance carriers disclaim coverage, or if we are unable to obtain coverage on commercially reasonable terms, we believe it is possible that costs associated with these claims could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows (see below ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings).\nWe rely on certain suppliers, subcontractors, and manufacturers for raw materials and other products and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials (including plastics and other petroleum-based materials, along with semi-conductors and precious metals) and subcontracting services we use in our manufacturing could have a negative effect on our cost of sales and our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Inability to meet the demands of our customers could result in the loss of future sales.\nIn addition, the costs to manufacture our products depend in part on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. We may not be able to pass along to our customers all or a portion of our higher costs of raw materials due to competitive and market pressures, which could decrease our earnings and profitability.\nWe also have collaborative arrangements with three key foreign suppliers under which we request the development of certain items and components, which we purchase pursuant to purchase orders. Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. The majority of our raw materials are purchased from sole-source suppliers. While we believe we could ultimately procure other sources for these components, should we experience any significant disruptions in this key supply chain, there are no assurances that we could do so in a timely manner which could render us unable to meet the demands of our customers, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria and could be affected due to multiple weather risks, including risks to our Florida facility from hurricanes and similar phenomena.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria and could be affected by multiple weather risks, most notably hurricanes in Clearwater, Florida. Although we carry property and casualty insurance and business interruption insurance, future possible disruptions of operations or damage to property, plant and equipment due to hurricanes or other weather risks could result in impaired production and affect our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and impair important business relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. We do, however, maintain a backup power source at our Clearwater facility, are working to establish deeper redundancies between both facilities, and have a disaster recovery plan in place to help mitigate this risk.\nQuality Management and Product Liability\nThe success of our business depends on the quality of our products, and we have global processes, procedures and programs that are intended to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality. We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims; these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class.\nQuality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients, and the serious and potentially costly consequences of product failure. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. If they were to occur, component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product related information, could result in an unsafe condition, injury to, or even death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall or issuance of safety notices relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. Further, we may be exposed to unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with COVID-19, and its related impacts could impact production of products that could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims, as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe energy-based medical device industry in the aesthetics market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe energy-based medical device industry for the aesthetics market is highly competitive. Many competitors in this industry are well-established, do a substantially greater amount of business, and have greater financial resources and facilities than we do.\nWe have invested and continue to invest, substantial resources to develop and monetize our Renuvion\u00ae technology into the cosmetic surgery market. We believe we must continue to develop new applications for our products and obtain new indications for use in order to stay competitive. If we are unable to gain acceptance of our technology in the marketplace, or obtain new indications for use, our business and results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nPart of our strategy depends on developing strong working relationships with key plastic surgeons, cosmetic physicians and other healthcare professionals. The guidance we get from these relationships is important from both a commercialization strategy and product development standpoint. Without these relationships, the development and commercialization of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol \u201cAPYX\u201d. The market price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and announcements by us or by third parties may have a significant impact on our stock price. These announcements may include:\n\u2022our listing status on the The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC;\n\u2022our operating results falling below the expectations of public market analysts and investors;\n\u2022developments in our relationships with or developments affecting our major customers;\n\u2022negative regulatory action or regulatory non-approval with respect to our new products;\n\u2022government regulation, governmental investigations, or audits related to us or to our products;\n\u2022developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors and\n\u2022changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock.\nThe stock market has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for the medical technology sector companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, future sales by our security holders may lower the price of our common stock, which could result in losses to our stockholders.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock and, even if we change that policy, we may be unable to pay dividends on it.\nWe currently do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and invest in our business. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nIf we change that policy and commence paying dividends, we will not be obligated to continue paying those dividends, and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. If we commence paying dividends in the future, our board of directors may decide, at its discretion, at any time, to decrease the number of dividends, otherwise modify or repeal the dividend policy or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends. Under Delaware law, our board of directors may not authorize the payment of a dividend unless it is paid out of our statutory surplus.\nExercise of options issued by us will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our outstanding stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants amounted to 5,397,691 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 15.7% of our outstanding common stock.\nThe exercise of some or all of our stock options will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may, in the future, identify deficiencies in controls over financial reporting.\nWhile we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure and reporting controls were effective as included in Part II, Item 9A, there can be no assurance that future control deficiencies or material weaknesses will not be identified. If we do identify additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, and to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC, may likely be adversely affected.\nWe are at risk of being the victim of a cyber-attack or a security breach that may expose confidential customer, product and Company data or compromise our internal IT infrastructure. This could lead to liabilities resulting from failure to comply with US and foreign data security and privacy regulations and negative impacts to our business operations.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nWe store in our computer systems and network various elements of data and information related to our customers, products and company that could be compromised as the result of a cyber-attack or security breach. If an individual or group of individuals, including a Company employee, were to compromise confidential information, or if customer confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a security breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, we may face substantial liabilities or incur penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws or regulations. We also rely heavily on our internal systems, network and data. To date, we have not had any breaches against our systems and network, and we obtain cyber security insurance coverage on an annual basis. However, any future attacks on our IT infrastructure could have a significant impact on our daily manufacturing and customer service functions which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, potentially in excess of our current coverage limits.\nOur business is dependent on the security of our IT networks and those of our customers. Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our engagements and impede our ability to provide critical services to our customers, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts. Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our customers and clients of our customers. While we take measures to protect the security of, and unauthorized access to, our systems, as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow or those systems of our customers into which we operate and rely upon, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nData privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate and continue to develop in ways which we cannot predict. We are subject to U.S. federal and state laws regarding data privacy and security including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. We are also subject to foreign data privacy and security laws, including the Global Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the European Union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights.
