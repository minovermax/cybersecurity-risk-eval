This section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our other publicly available filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and further actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. On March 12, 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States a national emergency. As a result of the pandemic, we have experienced significant business disruption. For example, in order to meet the demand for COVID-19-related hospitalizations, various governments, governmental agencies and hospital administrators required certain hospitals to postpone some elective procedures. As a majority of our products are utilized in elective surgeries or procedures, the deferrals of such surgeries and procedures have had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak has also resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders, social distancing requirements, and business limitations and shutdowns. While these measures have negatively impacted the ability of our sales professionals to reach physicians, such measures have not yet had any significant impacts on our product supply chain. However, any negative impacts on the production and delivery of our products in the future may result in a decline in sales, an increase in accounts receivable reserves, lower gross margins, and greater challenges in forecasting business results and making business decisions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in a period of regional, national or global economic slowdown or regional, national or global recessions. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the outbreak, its severity, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks identified within this Annual Report for year ended December 31, 2020. Depending on the continued severity and ultimate duration of COVID-19, the negative effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses in all fiscal years since inception. We incurred net losses of $32.9 million, $13.7 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of ongoing losses, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $161.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant product development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and other expenses. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our products to achieve and sustain profitability.\nAt present, we rely solely on the commercialization of our products to generate revenue, and we expect to generate substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products. In order to successfully commercialize our products, we will need to continue to expand our marketing efforts to develop new relationships and expand existing relationships with customers, to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products in additional countries, to achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and to develop and commercialize our products with new features or for additional indications. If we fail to successfully commercialize our products, we may never receive a return on the substantial investments in product development, sales and marketing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and quality assurance we have made, as well as further investments we intend to make, which may cause us to fail to generate revenue and gain economies of scale from such investments.\nIn addition, potential customers may decide not to purchase our products, or our customers may decide to cancel orders due to changes in treatment offerings, research and development plans, adverse clinical outcomes, difficulties in obtaining coverage or reimbursement for procedures using our products, difficulties obtaining approval from a hospital, complications with manufacturing or the utilization of technology developed by other parties, all of which are circumstances outside of our control.\nIn addition, demand for our products may not increase as quickly as we predict, and we may be unable to increase our revenue levels as we expect. Even if we succeed in increasing adoption of these systems by physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new customers and developing and commercializing new features or indications for these systems, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing commercial operations, develop and commercialize new products and expand our operations.\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our current cash, borrowing capacity under our loan agreements, cash receipts from sales of our products and net proceeds from our June 2020, December 2019 and December 2018 follow-on offerings of common stock will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If our available cash balances, borrowing capacity, net proceeds from prior stock offerings and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower demand for our products as a result of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing.\nWe may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to:\n\u2022 increase our sales and marketing efforts to increase market adoption of our products and address competitive developments;\n\u2022 provide for supply and inventory costs associated with plans to accommodate potential increases in demand for our products;\n\u2022 fund development and marketing efforts of any future products or additional features to then-current products;\n\u2022 acquire, license or invest in new technologies;\n\u2022 acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u2022 finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to achieve revenue growth and improve gross margins;\n\u2022 our rate of progress in establishing coverage and reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international commercial third-party payors and government payors;\n\u2022 the cost of expanding our operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 our rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our products;\n\u2022 the cost of research and development activities;\n\u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022 costs related to international expansion; and\n\u2022 the potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products.\nAdditional capital may not be available at such times or in amounts as needed by us. Even if capital is available, it might be available only on unfavorable terms. Any additional equity or convertible debt financing into which we enter could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose covenants upon us that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If access to sufficient capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail one or more product development or commercialization programs, or we may be required to significantly reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all our assets.\nOur sales volumes and our results of operations may fluctuate over the course of the year.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, which may include, among other things:\n\u2022 the number of products sold in the quarter;\n\u2022 the unpredictability of sales of full sets of implants and instruments to our international distributors;\n\u2022 the demand for, and pricing of, our products and the products of our competitors;\n\u2022 the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products;\n\u2022 the costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022 increased competition;\n\u2022 the availability and cost of components and materials;\n\u2022 the number of selling days in the quarter;\n\u2022 fluctuation and foreign currency exchange rates; or\n\u2022 impairment and other special charges.\nOur loan and security agreement with Squadron Capital LLC contains covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOn December 31, 2017, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security agreement with Squadron Capital LLC (\"Squadron\"), which was further amended in May 2019 and August 2020 (as amended, the \"Second Amended Loan Agreement\"). The Second Amended Loan Agreement currently provides for a $25.0 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we have no outstanding indebtedness under the Second Amended Loan Agreement. The Second Amended Loan Agreement restricts our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 dispose of or sell our assets;\n\u2022 modify our organizational documents;\n\u2022 merge with or acquire other entities or assets;\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 create liens on our assets;\n\u2022 pay dividends; and\n\u2022 make investments.\nThe covenants in the Second Amended Loan Agreement, as well as any future financing agreements into which we may enter, may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Second Amended Loan Agreement. If not waived, future defaults could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the Second Amended Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Indebtedness - Loan Agreement.\u201d\nIf we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous U.S. states and territories, as well as certain countries outside the U.S. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various tax jurisdictions that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including passage of the newly enacted U.S. federal income tax law, changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and\nchanges in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $98.9 million, $68.9 million and $16.9 million, respectively. The federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2028. The deferred tax assets, except for those recorded in Israel, were fully offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and no income tax benefit has been recognized in continuing operations. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely; but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. Each state and foreign jurisdiction has its own net operating loss carryforward and carryback rules with varying conformity to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We determined that an ownership change occurred on May 30, 2014, resulting in a limitation of approximately $1.1 million per year being imposed on the use of our pre-change NOLs of approximately $49.0 million. A second ownership change occurred on December 11, 2018. The estimated annual limitation is $9.7 million, which is increased by $22.4 million over the first five years as a result of an unrealized built in gain. It is possible that we have experienced other ownership changes. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to commercialize our products in development and to develop and commercialize additional products through our research and development efforts, and if we fail to do so we may be unable to compete effectively.\nIn order to increase our market share in the pediatric orthopedic markets, we must successfully commercialize our current products in development, enhance our existing product offerings and introduce new products in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressures and technologies. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological changes, new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our business prospects depend in part on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and applications for our technology, including in new markets that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances, while improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of our products. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our products. It is important that we anticipate changes in technology and market demand, as well as physician, hospital and healthcare provider practices to successfully develop, obtain clearance or approval, if required, and successfully introduce new, enhanced and competitive technologies to meet our prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe might be unable to successfully commercialize our current products with domestic or international regulatory clearances or approvals or develop or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals to market new products. Additionally, these products and any future products might not be accepted by the orthopedic surgeons or the third-party payors who reimburse for the procedures performed with our products or may not be successfully commercialized due to other factors. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 properly identify and anticipate clinician and patient needs;\n\u2022 develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022 adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022 demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products; and\n\u2022 obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements.\nIf we do not develop and obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to develop enhancements or new generations of our products successfully, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nNevertheless, we must carefully manage our introduction of new products. If potential customers believe such products will offer enhanced features or be sold for a more attractive price, they may delay purchases until such products are available. We may also have excess or obsolete inventory as we transition to new products, and we have no experience in managing product transitions.\nIf the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Furthermore, a malfunction by one of our products may not be detected for an extended period of time, which may result in delay or failure to remedy the condition for which the product was prescribed. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may be unable to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not grow.\nOur currently marketed products are, and any future products we develop and commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. The industry in which we operate is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and are safer, less invasive and more effective than competing products and treatments. Because of the size of the potential market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products.\nWe have competitors in each of our three product categories, including the DePuy Synthes Companies (a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson), Medtronic plc and Smith & Nephew plc. At any time, these and other potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that may render our products obsolete or uncompetitive. In addition, they may gain a market advantage by developing and patenting competitive products or processes earlier than we can or by obtaining regulatory clearances or market registrations more rapidly than we can. Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater sales and financial resources than we do. In addition, these companies may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships with orthopedic surgeons and greater experience in launching, marketing, distributing and selling products.\nIn addition, new market participants continue to enter the orthopedic industry. Many of these new competitors specialize in a specific product or focus on a particular market sector, making it more difficult for us to increase our overall market position. The frequent introduction by competitors of products that are or claim to be superior to our products or that are alternatives to our existing or planned products may also create market confusion that may make it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our products over competing products. In addition, the entry of multiple new products and competitors may lead some of our\ncompetitors to employ pricing strategies that could adversely affect the pricing of our products and pricing in the orthopedic surgery market generally.\nWe also face a particular challenge of overcoming the long-standing practices by some orthopedic surgeons of using the products of our larger, more established competitors. Orthopedic surgeons who have completed many successful, complex surgeries using the products made by these competitors may be disinclined to adopt new products with which they are less familiar. Further, orthopedic surgeons may choose to use the products of our larger, more established competitors because of their broad and comprehensive adult orthopedic offerings. If these orthopedic surgeons do not adopt our products, then our revenue growth may slow or decline and our stock price may decline.\nOur competitors may also develop and patent processes or products earlier than we can or obtain domestic or international regulatory clearances or approvals for competing products more rapidly than we can, which could impair our ability to develop and commercialize similar processes or products. We also compete with our competitors in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. In addition, we compete with our competitors to engage the services of independent sales agencies and distributors, both those presently working with us and those with whom we hope to work as we expand.\nWe provide implant and instrument sets for the majority of surgeries performed using our products, and maintaining sufficient levels of inventory could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges.\nWe are required to maintain significant levels of implant and instrument sets for consignment to our customers. The amount of this investment is driven by the number of orthopedic surgeons or hospitals using our products, and as the number of different orthopedic surgeons and hospitals that use our products increases, the number of implant and instrument sets required to meet this demand will increase. Because we do not have the sales volume of some larger companies, we may be unable to utilize our instrument sets as often and our return on assets may be lower when compared to such companies. In addition, because fewer than all of the components of each set are used in a typical surgery, certain portions of the set may become obsolete before they can be used. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. In addition, as we introduce new products, new implant and instrument sets may be required, with a significant initial investment required to accommodate the launch of the product.\nThe provision of loaned instrument sets to our customers may implicate certain federal and state fraud and abuse laws.\nIn the United States, we typically loan instrument sets for each surgery performed using our products at no additional charge to the customer. The provision of these instruments at no charge to our customers may implicate certain federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Because the provision of loaned instrument sets may result in a benefit to our customers, the government could view this practice as a prohibited transfer of value intended to induce customers to purchase our products that are used in procedures reimbursed by a federal healthcare program. For further discussion of these laws, see \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Matters.\"\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and health information privacy and security laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions or investments in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, through the licensing of products or technologies from third parties or other strategic alliances, and the failure to manage acquisitions, investments, licenses or other strategic alliances, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures, technologies and market pressures. Accordingly, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire, make investments in or license other technologies, products and businesses that may enhance our capabilities, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. Potential and completed acquisitions, strategic investments, licenses and other alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 difficulty assimilating or integrating acquired or licensed technologies, products or business operations;\n\u2022 issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions or strategic alliances, including the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities and the incurrence of debt or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business and disruption of ongoing operations;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022 potential losses related to investments in other companies;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 increased legal and accounting compliance costs.\nWe do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions or strategic relationships we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such transactions on favorable terms or at all or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology into our business or retain any key personnel, suppliers or distributors. Our ability to successfully grow through strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses, technologies or products and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations.\nForeign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures, languages and legal and regulatory environments, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nTo finance any acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may be unable to consummate any acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances using our stock as consideration.\nAs discussed above, acquisitions of, or investments in, new or complementary businesses, products or technologies are inherently risky. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. We also cannot be certain that the businesses, products or technologies we acquire or invest in will become or remain profitable.\nWe may be unable to gain the support of leading hospitals and key opinion leaders, which may make it difficult to establish our products as a standard of care and achieve market acceptance.\nOur strategy includes educating leading hospitals and key opinion leaders in the industry. If these hospitals and key opinion leaders determine that alternative technologies are more effective or that the benefits offered by our products are not sufficient to justify their higher cost, or if we encounter difficulty promoting adoption or establishing these systems as a standard of care, our ability to achieve market acceptance of the products we introduce could be significantly limited.\nWe may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals.\nWe seek to maintain close working relationships with respected orthopedic surgeons and medical personnel in hospitals and other healthcare organizations who assist in product research and development. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of our proprietary products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our access to these professionals has been limited as hospitals have restricted access for non-patients, including our research and development specialists and other employees, and governmental authorities have imposed travel restrictions, shutdowns or similar measures, which has adversely affected our ability to develop, market and sell products. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be further adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully demonstrate to orthopedic surgeons the merits of our products compared to those of our competitors.\nOrthopedic surgeons play a significant role in determining the course of treatment and, ultimately, the type of products that will be used to treat a patient. As a result, our success depends, in large part, on our ability to effectively market to them and demonstrate to orthopedic surgeons the merits of our products compared to those of our competitors for use in treating patients. Acceptance of our products depends on educating orthopedic surgeons as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived clinical benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our products as compared to our competitors\u2019 products, and on training orthopedic surgeons in the proper use of our products. If we are not successful in convincing orthopedic surgeons of the merits of our products or educating them on the use of our products, they may not use our products or use them effectively and we may be unable to increase our sales, sustain our growth or achieve and sustain profitability.\nFurthermore, we believe many orthopedic surgeons may be hesitant to adopt our products unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer-reviewed journal articles, that our products provide benefits or are attractive alternatives to our competitors\u2019 products. Orthopedic surgeons may be hesitant to change their surgical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022 lack of experience with our products;\n\u2022 existing relationships with competitors and sales distributors that sell competitive products;\n\u2022 lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;\n\u2022 perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022 less attractive availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems compared to procedures using other products and techniques;\n\u2022 costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment; and\n\u2022 the time commitment that may be required for training.\nIn addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential orthopedic surgeons are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from such orthopedic surgeons or long-term data does not show the benefits of using our products, orthopedic surgeons may not use our products. In such circumstances, we may not achieve expected sales, growth or profitability.\nIf orthopedic surgeons fail to safely and appropriately use our products, or if we are unable to train orthopedic surgeons on the safe and appropriate use of our products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nAn important part of our sales process includes the ability to screen for and identify orthopedic surgeons who have the requisite training and experience to safely and appropriately use our products. If orthopedic surgeons are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us. If we are unable to successfully identify\northopedic surgeon customers who will be able to successfully deploy our products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nThere is a learning process involved for orthopedic surgeons to become proficient in the use of our products. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts with respect to future products to train a sufficient number of orthopedic surgeons and to provide them with adequate instruction in the use of our products. This training process may take longer than expected and may therefore affect our ability to increase sales. Convincing orthopedic surgeons to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we may not be successful in these efforts.\nAlthough we believe our interactions with orthopedic surgeons are conducted in compliance with FDA, federal and state fraud and abuse and other applicable laws and regulations developed both nationally and in foreign countries, if the FDA or other competent authority determines that any of our activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or promotion of an intended purpose not covered by FDA approved labeling or the current European Union product certification, or CE Mark, affixed to our product, they could request that we modify our activities, issue corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalty. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nWe have a limited operating history and may face difficulties encountered by early stage companies in new and evolving markets.\nWe began operations in 2007. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. In assessing our prospects, you must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and evolving markets. These risks include our ability to:\n\u2022 manage rapidly changing and expanding operations;\n\u2022 establish and increase awareness of our brand and strengthen customer loyalty;\n\u2022 increase the number of our independent sales agencies and international distributors to expand sales of our products in the United States and in targeted international markets;\n\u2022 implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy;\n\u2022 respond effectively to competitive pressures and developments;\n\u2022 continue to develop and enhance our products and products in development;\n\u2022 obtain regulatory clearance or approval to commercialize new products and enhance our existing products;\n\u2022 expand our presence in existing and commence operations in new international markets; and\n\u2022 attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our revenue is typically higher in the summer months and holiday periods, driven by higher sales of our scoliosis and trauma and deformity products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of pediatric surgeries during these periods due to recovery time provided by breaks in the school year. Additionally, our scoliosis patients tend to have additional health challenges that make scheduling their procedures variable in nature. As a result of these factors, our financial results for any single quarter or for periods of less than a year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nIf we are unable to convince hospital facilities to approve the use of our products, our sales may decrease.\nIn the United States, in order for orthopedic surgeons to use our devices, the hospital facilities where these orthopedic surgeons treat patients will typically require us to obtain approval from the facility\u2019s value analysis committee, or VAC. VACs typically review the comparative effectiveness and cost of medical devices used in the facility. The makeup and evaluation processes for VACs vary considerably, and it can be a lengthy, costly and time-consuming effort to obtain approval by the relevant VAC. For example, even if we have an agreement with a hospital system for the purchase of our products, in most cases, we must obtain VAC approval by each hospital within the system to sell at that particular hospital. Additionally, hospitals typically require separate VAC approval for each specialty in which our products are used, which may result in multiple VAC approval processes within the same hospital even if such product has already been approved for use by a different specialty group. We may need VAC approval for each different device to be used by the orthopedic surgeons in that specialty. In addition, hospital facilities and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, which manage purchasing for multiple facilities, may also require us to enter into a purchase agreement and satisfy numerous elements of their administrative procurement process, which can also be a lengthy, costly, and time-consuming effort. If we do not obtain access to hospital facilities in a timely manner, or at all, via these VAC and purchase contract processes, or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure contracts in a timely manner, or at all, our operating costs will increase, our sales may decrease, and our operating results may be harmed. Furthermore, we may expend significant effort in these costly and time-consuming processes and still may not obtain VAC approval or a purchase contract from such hospitals or GPOs.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to successfully expand our sales infrastructure and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products. We began selling our products in the United States in 2008 and internationally in 2011. In 2017, we began to supplement our use of independent stocking distributors with direct sales programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. We began selling direct to Canada in September 2018, Belgium and the Netherlands in January 2019, Italy in March 2020 and Germany, Switzerland and Austria in January 2021. Additionally, in March 2019, we established an operating company in the Netherlands to further enhance our operations in Europe. In these markets, we work through sales agencies that are paid a commission. As of December 31, 2020, our international sales organization consisted of 42 independent stocking distributors and 11 independent sales agencies in 44 countries.Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our independent sales agencies and distributors. If our independent sales agencies or distributors fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales could significantly decrease.\nIn addition, our future sales will largely depend on our ability to increase our marketing efforts and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs. We believe it is necessary to utilize a sales force that includes sales agencies with specific technical backgrounds that can support our customers\u2019 needs. We will also need to attract independent sales personnel and attract and develop marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such independent sales agencies, distributors and marketing employees is intense and we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel to maintain an effective sales and marketing force. If we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability.\nAs we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to existing products, we will need to expand the reach of our marketing and sales networks. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled independent sales agencies and distributors with significant technical knowledge in various areas. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. If we fail to train new hires adequately, or if we experience high turnover in our sales force in the future, new hires may not become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally, we may be unable to effectively commercialize our products.\nWe lack published long-term data supporting superior clinical outcomes enabled by our products, which could limit sales.\nWe lack published long-term data supporting superior clinical outcomes enabled by our products. For this reason, orthopedic surgeons and other clinicians may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would slow the adoption of our products by orthopedic surgeons, would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected sales and could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability.\nIn addition, because certain of our products have only been on the market for a few years, we have limited data with respect to treatment using these products. If future patient studies or clinical testing do not support our belief that our products offer a more advantageous treatment for a broad spectrum of pediatric orthopedic conditions, market acceptance of our products could fail to increase or could decrease.\nIf coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products significantly decline, orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers who purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the cost of our products in the procedures in which they are employed. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for products used in surgical procedures, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the surgery is performed. Some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt our products in light of the additional associated cost. Further, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for the procedures using our products may make it difficult for existing customers to continue using, or to adopt, our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement.\nTo contain costs of new technologies, governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing new and existing treatments by requiring extensive evidence of favorable clinical outcomes. Orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third-party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products. Payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. If third-party payors issue non-coverage policies or if our customers are not reimbursed at adequate levels, this could adversely affect sales of our products.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement rates and policies. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or PFS, through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a Quality Payment Program, or QPP, for Medicare physicians, nurses and other \u201celigible clinicians\u201d beginning in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the QPP will impact overall reimbursement under the PFS. While MACRA applies only to Medicare reimbursement, Medicaid and private payors often follow Medicare payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may result in reduced demand for our products. However, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nMoreover, some healthcare providers in the United States have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Healthcare providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive clinically appropriate products available. Additionally, as a result of reform of the U.S.\nhealthcare system, changes in reimbursement policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit or restrict coverage and reimbursement for our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nOutside of the United States, reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for orthopedic implants and procedures. Additionally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the United States are not obtained, international sales of our products may decline.\nThe marketability of our products may suffer if government and commercial third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nOur employees, consultants, independent sales agencies, stocking distributors or other commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, consultants, independent sales agencies and distributors and other commercial partners may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the regulations of the FDA and other U.S. healthcare regulators, as well as non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, manufacturing standards, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry, including the sale of medical devices, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees, sales agencies, distributors and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, foreign liability, employee benefits liability, property, umbrella, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if these policies will provide us with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nWe bear the risk of warranty claims on our products.\nWhile we have no history of warranty claims, have no warranty reserves and had no warranty expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, we bear the risk of warranty claims on the products we supply. We may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by our suppliers or vendors in the event of a successful warranty claim against us by a customer or that any recovery from such vendor or supplier would be adequate. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may arise after our ability to bring corresponding warranty claims against such suppliers expires, which could result in costs to us.\nThe proliferation of physician-owned distributorships could result in increased pricing pressure on our products or harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with those distributorships.\nPhysician-owned distributorships, or PODs, are product distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. PODs derive a portion, or substantially all, of their revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, products ordered by the physician-owners for use in procedures the physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals and other facilities that purchase from or through the POD, or otherwise generate revenue based directly or indirectly on product orders arranged for by physician-owners.\nOn March 26, 2013, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the DHHS, issued a special fraud alert on PODs and stated that it views PODs as inherently suspect under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and is concerned about the proliferation of PODs. Notwithstanding the DHHS\u2019s concern about PODs, the number of PODs in the spinal surgery industry may continue to grow as economic pressures increase throughout the industry, hospitals, insurers and physicians search for ways to reduce costs and, in the case of the physicians, search for ways to increase their incomes. PODs and the physicians who own, or partially own, them have significant market knowledge and access to the orthopedic surgeons who use our products and the hospitals that purchase our products and thus the growth of PODs may reduce our ability to compete effectively for business from orthopedic surgeons who own such distributorships.\nRisks Related to Administrative, Organizational and Commercial Operations and Growth\nWe may be unable to manage our anticipated growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe have been growing rapidly and have a relatively short history of operating as a commercial company. For example, our revenue grew from $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to continue to grow our business operations and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This anticipated growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including our supply chain operations, quality control, technical support and customer service, sales force management and general and financial administration. We may be unable to maintain the quality of or delivery timelines of our products or satisfy customer demand as it grows. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may implement new enterprise software systems in a number of areas affecting a broad range of business processes and functional areas. The time and resources required to implement these new systems is uncertain and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could harm our business.\nAs our commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for our supply chain, customer service, billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. These increases in scale or expansion of personnel may not be successfully implemented.\nThe loss of our senior management or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled salespeople and engineers could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of the members of our executive management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop our products and as we expand our commercial activities. We believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions, and the loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could negatively impact our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. We do not maintain key man life insurance with any of our employees. We have employment agreements with each of the members of our senior management; however, the existence of these employment agreement does not guarantee our retention of these employees for any period of time.\nOur commercial, supply chain and research and development programs and operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled salespeople and engineers. We may be unable to attract or retain qualified managers, salespeople or engineers in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel among medical device businesses. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. Recruiting and retention difficulties can limit our\nability to support our commercial, supply chain and research and development programs. All of our employees are at-will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate his or her employment at any time. The loss of key employees, the failure of any key employee to perform or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, or an inability to effectively plan for and implement a succession plan for key employees could harm our business.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nWe market and sell our products in 44 countries outside of the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 11%, 24% and 24% of our revenue was attributable to our international customers, respectively. These customers are generally allowed to return products, and some are thinly capitalized. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subjects us to extensive U.S. and other foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. We expect our international activities will be dynamic over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022 having to comply with various U.S. and international laws, including export control laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and anti-money laundering laws;\n\u2022 differing regulatory requirements for obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products;\n\u2022 changes in, or uncertainties relating to, foreign rules and regulations that may impact our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022 tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;\n\u2022 differing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022 imposition of differing labor laws and standards;\n\u2022 economic, political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;\n\u2022 an inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and\n\u2022 availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.\nWe expect we will continue expanding into other international markets; however, our expansion plans may not be realized, or if realized, may not be successful. We expect each market to have particular regulatory and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets, including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations, could harm our business.\nWe could be negatively impacted by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws or violations of our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including in countries that do not have as strong a commitment to anti-corruption and ethical behavior that is required by U.S. laws or by corporate policies. We are subject to the risk that we, our U.S. employees or our employees located in other jurisdictions or any third parties\nsuch as our sales agencies and distributors that we engage to do work on our behalf in foreign countries may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act of 2010, or the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. The FCPA generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments, offers or promises to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to, among other things, prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made.\nAs a substantial portion of our revenue is, and we expect will continue to be, from jurisdictions outside of the United States, we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments, offers or promises of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other laws and regulations. Although we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, such policy may not be effective at preventing all potential FCPA or other violations. Although our agreements with our international distributors clearly state our expectations for our distributors\u2019 compliance with U.S. laws, including the FCPA, and provide us with various remedies upon any non-compliance, including the ability to terminate the agreement, our distributors may not comply with U.S. laws, including the FCPA.\nIn addition, we operate in certain countries in which the government may take an ownership stake in an enterprise and such government ownership may not be readily apparent, thereby increasing potential anti-corruption law violations. Any violation of the FCPA and U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or any similar anti-corruption law or regulation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we have internal ethics policies with which we require our employees to comply in order to ensure that our business is conducted in a manner that our management deems appropriate. If these anti-corruption laws or internal policies were to be violated, our reputation and operations could also be substantially harmed. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. As a result of our focus on managing our growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have international operations and, as a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our selling price or risk making our products less competitive in international markets or our costs could increase. Also, if our international sales increase, we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollars, which could expose us to foreign currency risks, including changes in currency exchange rates. We do not currently engage in any hedging transactions. If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful and our business could be harmed.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and The Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel will devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in\nthe future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our disclosure controls and other procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls could negatively impact the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we may be required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may be unable to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\").\nIf we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. We do not have redundant systems at this time. While we will attempt to mitigate interruptions, we may experience difficulties in implementing some upgrades, which would impact our business operations, or experience difficulties in operating our business during the upgrade, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the current implementation of our information technology systems, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our infrastructure. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems. Failure to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively could have a materially adverse effect on our business. For example, third parties may attempt to hack into our systems and obtain proprietary information.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the operation of the business. These systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. The Company has contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, however, if they are not effective on a timely basis, business interruptions could occur which may adversely impact results of operations.\nIncreased cyber-security threats also pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data stored on these systems. In addition, a greater number of our employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to greater risks related to cyber-security. Any breach of our systems could result in disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or financial information. Such events could cause damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and result in significant recovery or remediation costs, which may adversely impact results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nWe, as well as certain of our officers and distributors, may be subject to other claims or lawsuits. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, our business may be harmed, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for orthopedic surgery procedures. These surgeries involve significant risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis and even death. Furthermore, if orthopedic surgeons are not sufficiently trained in the use of our products, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.\nWe have had, and continue to have, a small number of product liability claims relating to our products, and in the future, we may be subject to additional product liability claims.\nRegardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for our products;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation;\n\u2022 significant litigation costs;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients;\n\u2022 product recalls;\n\u2022 material defense costs;\n\u2022 loss of revenue;\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize new products or product candidates; and\n\u2022 diversion of management attention from pursuing our business strategy.\nOur existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future. In addition, a recall of some of our products, whether or not the result of a product liability claim, could result in significant costs and loss of customers. In addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources\nand adversely affect or eliminate the prospects for commercialization or sales of a product or product candidate that is the subject of any such claim.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes and other events beyond our control.\nA major earthquake, fire or other disaster (such as a major flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption or terrorist attack) affecting our facilities, or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations, and delay or prevent product shipment or installation during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our suppliers\u2019 damaged manufacturing facilities; these delays could be lengthy and costly. If any of our customers\u2019 facilities are negatively impacted by a disaster, shipments of our products could be delayed. Additionally, customers may delay purchases of our products until operations return to normal. Even if we are able to quickly respond to a disaster, the ongoing effects of the disaster could create some uncertainty in the operations of our business. In addition, our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil or an outbreak of epidemic diseases could have a negative effect on our operations, those of our suppliers and customers and the ability to travel.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements, including but not limited to the HDE requirements and IRB regulations, could harm our business.\nWe and our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices: design, development and manufacturing; testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; clinical trials; product safety; marketing, sales and distribution; premarket clearance and approval; record keeping procedures; advertising and promotion; recalls and field safety corrective actions; post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; post-market approval studies; and product import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA enforces these regulatory requirements through periodic unannounced inspections. We do not know whether we will pass any future FDA inspections. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters; fines; injunctions; civil penalties; termination of distribution; recalls or seizures of products; delays in the introduction of products into the market; total or partial suspension of production; refusal to grant future clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nIn addition, our ApiFix Mid-C System is an approved device under the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) regulation. Approval under the HDE regulation is contingent upon the submission of periodic reports at intervals of one year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original HDE (August 2019). The FDA may grant an HDE, which is an exemption from the effectiveness requirements of sections 514 and 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, if the FDA determines that the device meets certain criteria. After HDE approval, the medical device may only be used after approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, has been obtained. Under FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. Failure to submit the necessary reports, IRB required modifications or IRB disapproval could cancel or delay our exemption which would cause our sales to decline.\nWe may not receive the necessary clearances or approvals for our future products, and failure to timely obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade our products, add new features and expand clearance or approval of our current products to new indications. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.\nModifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the device, which may limit the market for the device.\nIn the United States, we have obtained 510(k) premarket clearance from the FDA to market each of our products requiring such clearance. Any modifications to these existing products may require new 510(k) clearance; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain PMA process. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including: we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the product or modification is substantially equivalent to the proposed predicate device or safe and effective for its intended use; the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA initiated an evaluation, and in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the 510(k) clearance process. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval. Some of these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances.\nIn order to sell our products in member countries of the EEA our products must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.\nIn order to sell our products in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) our products must comply with the requirements of the UK Medical Device Regulations. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA Mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. A conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by an Approved Body under UK Medical Device Regulations, or Approved Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Approved Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Approved Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the UKCA Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related UK Declaration of Conformity.\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. If we fail to remain in compliance with applicable European and United Kingdom laws and directives, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE or UKCA Marks to our surgical systems, which would prevent us from selling them within the EEA and the United Kingdom, respectively.\nWe or our distributors will also need to obtain regulatory approval in other foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to market and sell our products.\nModifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMAs for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not approve or clear\nour products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or could require clinical trials to support any modifications. Any delay or failure in obtaining required clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of the 510(k) clearance process may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) notification for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. For example, the FDA is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. The FDA is expected to issue revised guidance, originally issued in 1997, to assist device manufacturers in making this determination. It is unclear whether the FDA\u2019s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510(k) is required for changes or modifications to existing devices. The FDA continues to review its 510(k) clearance process, which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents, which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances.\nOur products must be manufactured in accordance with federal and state regulations, and we could be forced to recall our installed systems or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical devices. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of subcontractors. Our products are also subject to similar state regulations and various laws and regulations of foreign countries governing manufacturing.\nOur third-party manufacturers may not take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products. In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions or civil penalties; suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances; seizures or recalls of our products; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; administrative or judicially imposed sanctions; the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our products; clinical holds; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and criminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nAny of these actions could significantly and negatively impact supply of our products. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and suffer reduced revenue and increased costs.\nIf treatment guidelines for the orthopedic conditions we are targeting change or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign and seek new marketing authorization from the FDA for one or more of our products.\nIf treatment guidelines for the orthopedic conditions we are targeting or the standard of care for such conditions evolves, we may need to redesign the applicable product and seek new clearances or approvals from the FDA. Our 510(k) clearances from the FDA are based on current treatment guidelines. If treatment guidelines change so that different treatments become desirable, the clinical utility of one or more of our products could be diminished and our business could suffer.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nOur products have been cleared by the FDA for specific indications. We train our marketing personnel and independent sales agencies and distributors to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our\nproducts off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in clearance of future products.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. We have in the past conducted several voluntary recalls of devices with lot-specific quality issues. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales.\nIf we or our distributors do not obtain and maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our products, we will be unable to market and sell our products outside of the United States.\nSales of our products outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. While the regulations of some countries may not impose barriers to marketing and selling our products or only require notification, others require that we or our distributors obtain the approval of a specified regulatory body. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining registrations or approvals, can be expensive and time-consuming, and we or our distributors may not receive regulatory approvals in each country in which we plan to market our products or we may be unable to do so on a timely basis. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations, clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. If we modify our products, we or our distributors may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals before we are permitted to sell the modified product. In addition, we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we or our distributors have received. If we or our distributors are unable to maintain our authorizations in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell the applicable product in that country.\nRegulatory clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and clearance or approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms in the United States, the United Kingdom or the European Union may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nIn September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposal would replace the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation, the Medical Devices Regulation. Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices.\nIn October 2013, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission\u2019s proposals. Under the revised proposals, only designated \u201cspecial notified bodies\u201d would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group, or MDCG (a new, yet to be created body chaired by the European Commission and representatives of certain European states), for an opinion. These new procedures may result in a longer or more burdensome assessment of our new products.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR, entered into force in May 2017 and, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was postponed from its original application date of May 2020 to May 2021. The Company can continue marketing existing CE-marked products under the previous regulation until March 2023 so long as a certification extension is granted by its notified body. Any products not yet CE-marked or products with significant changes that require additional notified review are subject to the MDR as of May 2021, including the requirement of obtaining QSR certification under the MDR. The MDR among other things, imposes additional reporting requirements on\nmanufacturers of high risk medical devices, imposes an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a \u201cqualified person\u201d responsible for regulatory compliance, and provides for more strict clinical evidence requirements.\nEffective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU. New regulations specific to the UK went into effect beginning January 1, 2021 with a transitional period through June 30, 2023. These regulations may impact our ability to sell our products in the UK. During the transition period devices with CE Markings may continue to be sold within the UK. Devices sold in Northern Ireland will be required to keep the CE Marking after the transition period ends.\nIn order to comply with the new regulations and continue selling medical devices in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) following the transition period, the Company must appoint a UK Responsible Person and register the medical devices with the MHRA. A new conformity assessment must be completed by a UK Approved Body. The Approved Body will audit and examine a product\u2019s technical dossiers and the manufacturers\u2019 quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Approved Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the UKCA Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout Great Britain. Once the product has been placed on the market in Great Britain, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, health information privacy and security laws and transparency laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician transparency laws. Our business practices and relationships with providers and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to patient information privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, civil penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil penalties, including treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022 the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022 the federal Physician Sunshine Act under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to the DHHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS and failure to do so may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state; and\n\u2022 analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. We have a variety of arrangements with our customers that could implicate these laws, including, among others, our consignment arrangements and our practice of loaning instrument sets to customers at no additional cost. We have also entered into consulting agreements and royalty agreements with physicians, including some who have ownership interests in us and/or influence the ordering of or use our products in procedures they perform. Compensation under some of these arrangements includes the provision of stock or stock options. We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies determine our financial relationships with such physicians to be in violation of applicable laws. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has\nled to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could harm our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other ways in which it may impact our business, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022 established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022 implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022 expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs.\nWe do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. The Biden Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Additionally, all or a portion of the Affordable Care Act and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, was signed into law, which, among other things, includes a program for providers to receive accelerated or advanced Medicare payments.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit reimbursement for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities may involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the\nuse, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials, but we do reserve funds to address these claims at both the federal and state levels. Although we believe the safety procedures of our manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines, which could be substantial.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on a network of third-party independent sales agencies and distributors to market and distribute our products, and if we are unable to maintain and expand this network, we may be unable to generate anticipated sales.\nWe rely on our network of independent sales agencies and distributors to market and distribute our products in both the United States and international markets.\nIn the United States, our products are primarily sold by a network of 36 independent sales agencies. We may not be successful in maintaining strong relationships with our independent sales agencies. In addition, our independent sales agencies are not required to sell our products on an exclusive basis and also are not required to sell any minimum quantity of our products. The failure of our network of independent sales agencies to generate U.S. sales of our products and promote our brand effectively would impair our business and results of operations.\nWe also sell our products in international markets, primarily through a network of 42 independent stocking distributors and 11 independent sales agencies. We sell our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we expect a significant amount of our revenue to come from international sales for the foreseeable future. In the past, we have experienced issues collecting payments from certain of our independent stocking distributors and we may again experience such issues in the future.\nOur ability to market, distribute, and sell our products through our network of distributors and agencies has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions, suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit person-to-person contact. We also face other significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the individuals who make up that network. We cannot control the efforts and resources our third-party sales agencies and distributors will devote to marketing our products. Our sales agencies and stocking distributors may be unable to successfully market and sell our products and may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts that enable the products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance in their respective jurisdictions. Additionally, in some international jurisdictions, we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process, while complying with all applicable rules and regulations, and we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively. If we are unable to attract additional international distributors, our international revenue may not grow.\nIf any of our independent sales agencies or distributors were to cease to do business with us, our sales could be adversely affected. Some of our independent sales agencies and distributors have historically accounted for a material portion of our sales volume. Sales through two of our independent sales agencies in the United States accounted for 14.2% and 13.8%, respectively, of our global revenue in 2020. Sales through two of our independent sales agencies in the United States accounted for 12.3% and 12.2%, respectively, of our global revenue in 2019. Sales through two of our independent sales agencies in the United States accounted for 12.1% and 11.2%, respectively, of our global revenue in 2018. If any such agency or distributor were to cease to sell and market our products, our sales could be adversely affected. In addition, if a dispute arises with a sales agency or distributor or if a sales agency or distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business, it may take time to locate an alternative sales agency or distributor, to seek appropriate regulatory approvals and to train new personnel to market our products, and our ability to sell those systems in the region formerly serviced by such terminated agent or distributor could be harmed. Any of our sales agencies or distributors could become insolvent or otherwise become unable to pay amounts owed to us when due. Any of these factors could reduce our revenue from affected markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation. If an\nindependent sales agency or distributor were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent them from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect our sales.\nIn any such situation in which we lose the services of an independent sales agency or distributor, we may need to seek alternative sales agencies or distributors, and our sales may be adversely affected. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain additional qualified independent sales agencies or distributors to work with us. We may be unable to enter into agreements with them on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified independent sales agencies or distributors would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales.\nAs a result of our reliance on third-party sales agencies and distributors, we may be subject to disruptions and increased costs due to factors beyond our control, including labor strikes, third-party error and other issues. If the services of any of these third-party sales agencies or distributors become unsatisfactory, including the failure of such sales agencies or distributors to properly train orthopedic surgeons in the utilization of our products, we may experience delays in meeting our customers\u2019 product demands and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to deliver products in a timely manner may damage our reputation and could cause us to lose current or potential customers.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers to assemble our products, and a loss or degradation in performance of these contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on a small number of third-party contract manufacturers in the United States to assemble our products. If any of these contract manufacturers fails to adequately perform, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Inadequate performance could include, among other things, the production of products that do not meet our quality standards, which could cause us to seek additional sources of manufacturing. Additionally, our contract manufacturers may decide in the future to discontinue or reduce the level of business they conduct with us. If we are required to change contract manufacturers due to any termination of our relationships with our contract manufacturers, we may lose revenue, experience manufacturing delays, incur increased costs or otherwise suffer impairment to our customer relationships. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish alternative manufacturing relationships on similar terms or without delay. Furthermore, our contract manufacturers could require us to move to another one of their production facilities. This could disrupt our ability to fulfill orders during a transition and impact our ability to utilize our current supply chain. In addition, we currently use Structure Medical, LLC and Vilex, LLC, Squadron-affiliated entities, as suppliers for some of our components of our products.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders, social distancing requirements, and business limitations and shutdowns, those measures, have not yet had any significant impacts on our product supply chain. However, any negative impacts on the assembly and production of our products in the future may result in a decline in sales.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our products to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of any systems, it would be costly to replace such systems in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our products and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to process orders for our products on a timely basis.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the majority of our products and may be unable to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe rely on several suppliers for the majority of our products and we maintain certain long-term contracts with these key suppliers. These suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply these products to us reliably and at the prices and levels we anticipate or are required by the market. For us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with products in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. An interruption in our commercial operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these products, and if we cannot obtain an acceptable substitute. If we are required to transition to new third-party suppliers for certain products, the use of products furnished by these alternative suppliers could require us to alter our operations.\nFurthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of our products, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery, could affect the performance specifications of our products or could require that we modify the design of those products. If the change in manufacturer results in a significant change to any product, a new 510(k) clearance from the FDA or similar international regulatory authorization may be necessary before we implement the change, which could cause substantial delays. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our ability to meet the demand for our products in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs discussed above under the third-party manufacturer risk factor, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet had any significant impacts on our product supply chain. However, any negative impacts on the production and supply of our products in the future may result in a decline in sales.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents and other intellectual property rights in the United States and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our platform technology. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 28 issued U.S. patents and 56 issued foreign patents and we had 35 pending U.S. patent applications and 40 pending foreign patent applications. Assuming all required fees continue to be paid, issued U.S. patents owned by us will expire between 2024 and 2036.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents have, or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our platform, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in a derivation proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nFurthermore, though an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive\nadvantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products;\n\u2022 any of our pending patent applications may issue as patents;\n\u2022 we will be able to successfully commercialize our products on a substantial scale, if approved, before our relevant patents we may have expire;\n\u2022 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents;\n\u2022 any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022 we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022 our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nWe rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us and have non-compete agreements with some, but not all, of our consultants. It is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or impact our stock price.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patent rights occur in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We do not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Third parties may, in the future, assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. As we continue to commercialize our products in their current or updated forms, launch new products and enter new markets, we expect competitors may claim that one or more of our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid filing rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of litigation and administrative proceedings may increase the risk of business resources and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent administration and litigation. We have, and we may in the future, receive letters or other threats or claims from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents. See \u201cItem 3. - Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nMoreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and challenges in U.S. District Court or before the U.S. International Trade Commission. Patents may be subjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can.\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022 stop making, selling, importing or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022 lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others; incur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022 pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022 pay the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022 redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive or infeasible; and\n\u2022 attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or from third parties who may attempt to license rights that they do not have.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products.\nIn addition, we generally indemnify our customers and international distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures, trade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Patent protection available in one country may not be available in other countries. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the\nUnited States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of our intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 commercial success and market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022 success of our competitors in developing or commercializing products;\n\u2022 ability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approvals for our products, or delays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 strategic transactions undertaken by us;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 product liability claims;\n\u2022 prevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022 disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or the healthcare industry;\n\u2022 healthcare reform measures in the United States;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n\u2022 future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n\u2022 business disruptions caused by earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters;\n\u2022 issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations regarding us; and\n\u2022 short interest reports and or trading.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced extreme volatility that have has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be attributed to being a newly public company. These broad market and industry fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe price of our stock may be vulnerable to manipulation, including through short sales.\nWe believe our common stock has been the subject of recent short selling efforts by certain market participants. Short sales are transactions in which a market participant sells a security that it does not own. To complete the transaction, the market participant must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer. The market participant is then obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of required replacement. If the price at the time of replacement is lower than the price at which the security was originally sold by the market participant, then the market participant will realize a gain on the transaction. Thus, it is in the market participant\u2019s interest for the market price of the underlying security to decline as much as possible during the period prior to the time of replacement. Short selling may negatively affect the value of our stock to the detriment of our stockholders.\nIn addition, market participants with disclosed short positions in our stock have published, and may in the future continue to publish, negative information regarding us that we believe is inaccurate and misleading. We believe that the publication of this negative information, and other efforts by certain market participants to manipulate the price of our common stock for their personal financial gain, may in the future lead to downward pressure on the price of our stock to the detriment of our stockholders.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \"smaller reporting company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2022, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31, or (ii) if our gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion in any fiscal year. \u201cEmerging growth companies\u201d may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors could find our common stock less attractive because we may rely\non these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, many of the same exemptions from reporting requirements available to us as an emerging growth company are also available to us as a smaller reporting company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, those exemptions may continue to be available to us. Some investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to certain restrictions described below. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we have a total of 19,560,291 outstanding shares of common stock, all of which may be resold in the public market immediately without restriction, other than shares owned by our affiliates, which may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to the conditions of Rule 144 including volume limitations. In addition, holders of an aggregate of approximately 5,378,291 shares of our common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans on a Registration Statement on Form S-8. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements described above.\nIf there is no viable public market for our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on Nasdaq, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of our common stock is not active. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nOur operating results for a particular period may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including: variations in the level of expenses related to our products or future development programs; level of underlying demand for our products; addition or termination of clinical trials; our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements; any intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved; and regulatory developments affecting our products or our competitors.\nIf our operating results for a particular period fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe comparisons of our financial\nresults from various reporting periods are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2020, our officers and directors, together with holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 30.5% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could attempt to delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company or our assets and might affect the prevailing price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may negatively impact the price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. In addition, pursuant to an agreement with the Company, Squadron has the right to designate up to four nominees for election to the Company\u2019s board of directors, depending on the percentage of capital stock beneficially owned by Squadron. Currently, three members of our board are Squadron designees.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022 a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022 no cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u2022 a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president;\n\u2022 an advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022 the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u2022 a requirement of approval of not less than 66 2\u22153% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action, or to amend specific provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved\nin a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our charter documents and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; therefore, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains, and the terms of any future credit agreements we enter into may contain, terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If no securities or industry analysts maintain coverage of the company, the price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 16989, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "KIDS"}
