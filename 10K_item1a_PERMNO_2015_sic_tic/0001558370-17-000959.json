RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this report, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in our securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties described in this Form 10-K actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not successfully commercialize NUCYNTA\u00ae ER and NUCYNTA\u00ae IR (NUCYNTA), our largest selling products, or Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae and Lazanda\u00ae, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn April 2015, we acquired and began commercial promotion of NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA. In October 2011, we began commercial sales of Gralise. In June 2012, we acquired Zipsor and began commercial promotion of Zipsor in July 2012. In July 2013, we acquired Lazanda and began commercial promotion of Lazanda in October 2013. In December 2013, we acquired CAMBIA and began commercial promotion of CAMBIA in February 2014. As a Company, we have a limited history of selling and marketing pharmaceutical products. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this section, our ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, our largest selling products, or Gralise, CAMBIA, Zipsor and Lazanda, depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to :\n\u00b7\ndevelop and execute our sales and marketing strategies for our products;\n\u00b7\nachieve, maintain and grow market acceptance of, and demand for, our products;\n\u00b7\nobtain and maintain adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing from managed care, government and other third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, manage or scale the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, managed markets, and other capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate and commercialize our products;\n\u00b7\nmaintain and extend intellectual property protection for our products; and\n\u00b7\ncomply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nIf we are unable to successfully achieve or perform these functions, we will not be able to maintain or increase our product revenues and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Further, if we are unable to maintain or increase our revenues from NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, our largest selling products which generated approximately 62% and 56% of our total product revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our products, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA), the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA applicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s) and is bioequivalent to the branded product, in addition to any data necessary to establish that any difference in strength, dosage, form, inactive ingredients or delivery mechanism does not result in different safety or efficacy profiles, as compared to the reference drug.\nThe FDCA requires an applicant for a drug that relies, at least in part, on the patent of one of our branded drugs to notify us of their application and potential infringement of our patent rights. Upon receipt of this notice we have 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the company seeking approval of a product covered by one of our patents. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years. If such a suit is commenced, the FDCA provides a 30-month stay on the FDA\u2019s approval of the competitor\u2019s application. Such litigation is often time-consuming and quite costly and may result in generic competition if the patents at issue are not upheld or if the generic competitor is found not to infringe such patents. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the standards for approval of ANDAs.\nWe have been involved in patent litigation lawsuits against filers of ANDAs (the Filers) seeking to market generic versions of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER before the expiration of the patents listed in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of FDA\u2019s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) for these two products. A two-week bench trial was completed on April 27, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued its opinion finding all three of the Orange Book patents valid and enforceable. As a result of the Court\u2019s decision, we expect an injunction to be issued ordering the effective date of approval for a generic NUCYNTA from the Filers to be no earlier than June 27, 2025. With regard to NUCYNTA ER, we expect an injunction to issue ordering the effective date of approval for one of the Filers (Alkem) to be no earlier than September 22, 2028, and the effective date of approval for the other two Filers (Actavis and Roxane) to be no earlier\nthan June 27, 2025. The foregoing periods of exclusivity may in the future be extended with the award of pediatric exclusivity.\nAny introduction of one or more products generic to NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, Gralise, CAMBIA, Zipsor or Lazanda, whether as a result of an ANDA or otherwise, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The filing of the ANDAs described above, or any other ANDA or similar application in respect to any of our products, could have an adverse impact on our stock price. Moreover, if the patents covering our products are not upheld in litigation or if a generic competitor is found not to infringe these patents, the resulting generic competition would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to negotiate acceptable pricing or obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nSales of our products depend significantly on the availability of acceptable pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as:\n\u00b7\ngovernment health administration authorities;\n\u00b7\nprivate health insurers;\n\u00b7\nhealth maintenance organizations;\n\u00b7\nmanaged care organizations;\n\u00b7\npharmacy benefit management companies; and\n\u00b7\nother healthcare-related organizations.\nIf reimbursement is not available for our products or product candidates, demand for our products may be limited. Further, any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third-party payers could have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\nThird-party payers frequently require that pharmaceutical companies negotiate agreements that provide discounts or rebates from list prices. We have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to certain third-party payers. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts or discounts to a greater number of third-party payers to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels for and access to our products for patients at co-pay levels that are reasonable and customary. If third-party payers do not accurately and timely report the eligibility and utilization of our products under their plans, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce sales of our products and harm our results of operations. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that such third-party payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, including one or more of our products. Any third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursement of, our products, including by limiting or denying reimbursement for new products or excluding products that were previously eligible for reimbursement, would limit the market acceptance and commercial prospects of our products and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been, and there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to commercialize our products profitably. We anticipate that the federal and state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt and implement healthcare policies, such as the ACA, intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include: controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to or limits on the pricing of drugs, including pricing controls, or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions. In California, voters rejected Proposition 61 in November 2016, a ballot initiative that would have prohibited the state from buying prescription drugs from a drug manufacturer at a price over the lowest price paid for such drug by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Although Proposition 61 was rejected, these and other cost containment or price control measures, if adopted at the federal or state level, could significantly decrease the price that\nwe receive for our products and any product that we may develop or acquire, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws and regulations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry, including the opioid market, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry could potentially affect our business. For instance, federal, state and local governments have recently given increased attention to the public health issue of opioid abuse. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently issued national, non-binding guidelines on the prescribing of opioids. In addition states, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York, have either recently enacted or have pending legislation designed to among other things, limit the duration and quantity of initial prescriptions of immediate release form of opiates and mandate the use by prescribers of prescription drug databases. These and other initiatives may result in the reduced prescribing and use of opioids, including NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We were named as a defendant in a case brought by the City of Chicago against a number of pharmaceutical companies marketing and selling opioid based pain medications, alleging misleading or otherwise improper promotion of opioid drugs to physicians and consumers. This case against the Company was dismissed. At the federal level, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy continues to coordinate efforts between the FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and other agencies to address this issue. The DEA continues to increase its efforts to hold manufacturers, distributors, prescribers and pharmacies accountable through various enforcement actions as well as the implementation of compliance practices for controlled substances. In addition, many state legislatures are considering various bills intended to reduce opioid abuse, for example by establishing prescription drug monitoring programs and mandating prescriber education. Further, the FDA is requiring \u201cblack-box\u201d warnings on immediate release opioids highlighting the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death. In addition, during the 2016 presidential campaign, President Trump called for the DEA to restrict the amount of opioids that can be manufactured in the U.S. These and other changes, and potential changes in laws and regulations, including those that have the effect of reducing the overall market for opioids or reducing the prescribing of opiods, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the pharmaceutical industry.\nTapentadol, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, is a proprietary opioid analgesic that we market exclusively in the U.S. NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA compete with a number of branded and generic products that are widely used to treat moderate to severe pain, including neuropathic pain associated with DPN, and acute pain, respectively. These products include OxyContin\u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tables), which is marketed by Purdue Pharma L.P., and OPANA\u00ae ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride), which is marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(promotion discountinued as of 2017), each of which is approved for marketing in the U.S. for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Each of OxyContin\u00ae and OPANA\u00ae ER have achieved significant levels of market acceptance. There are also a number of branded and generic opioids, including oxymorphone, fentanyl, morphine, buprenorphine and hydromorphone, which have received approval and are marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including chronic and acute pain. Butrans\u00ae (promoted by Purdue) will lose its patent in 2017. Pfizer\u2019s new opioid Troxyca\u00ae ER was approved in 2016, but not yet launched. Teva\u2019s VantrelaTM ER was approved in 2017, but not yet launched. Lyrica\u00ae (pregabalin), which is marketed by Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), has been approved for marketing in the U.S. for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Branded and generic versions of duloxetine and lidocaine have also been approved for marketing in the U.S. for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with DPN. There are a number of other products and treatments prescribed for, or under development, for the management of chronic and acute pain, including neuropathic pain associated with DPN, which are now or may become competitive with NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA.\nGabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer as Neurontin\u00ae for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for PHN. Pfizer\u2019s basic U.S. patents relating to Neurontin\u00ae have expired, and numerous companies have received approval to market generic versions of the immediate release product. In addition to receiving approval for marketing to treat neuropathic pain associated with DPN, Lyrica\u00ae (pregabalin), has also been approved for marketing in the U.S. for the treatment of post herpetic pain, fibromyalgia, adjunctive therapy, epileptic seizures, and nerve pain associated with spinal cord injury and has captured a significant portion of the market. Pfizer announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial\nresults for its Lyrica\u00ae controlled release formulation for fibromyalgia and for PHN (in 2012 and 2014, respectively), though its epilepsy trial did not meet primary endpoint (2012). Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC\u2019s Horizant\u2122 (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) is approved for the management of PHN and Restless Leg Syndrome. There are other products prescribed for or under development for PHN which are now or may become competitive with Gralise.\nDiclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is an NSAID that is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in adults, including the symptoms of arthritis. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the U.S. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate pain in the acute setting. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.\nAn alternate formulation of diclofenac is the active ingredient in CAMBIA that is approved in the U.S. for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans that are used to treat migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, seven triptans are available and sold in the U.S. (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig\u00ae nasal, Onzetra\u00ae Xsail\u00ae,TM ZembraceTM SymTouchTM and Treximet\u00ae, which is a fixed-dose combination product containing sumatriptan plus naproxen. Pfizer\u2019s Relpax\u00ae patent expired in December 2016. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment of migraines that are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA.\nFentanyl, an opioid analgesic, is currently sold by a number of companies for the treatment of breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant cancer patients. Branded fentanyl products against which Lazanda currently competes include Subsys\u00ae, which is sold by Insys Therapeutics, Inc., Fentora\u00ae and Actiq\u00ae, which are sold by Teva, Abstral\u00ae, which is sold by Sentynl Therapeutics Inc., and Onsolis\u00ae, which Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. plans to launch in 2017. Generic fentanyl products against which Lazanda currently competes are sold by Mallinckrodt, Teva and Endo.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense and we expect competition to increase. Competing products currently under development or developed in the future may prove superior to our products and achieve greater commercial acceptance. Most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do.\nOur Customer concentration may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to a limited number of independent wholesale drug distributors. Three of our wholesale distributors represented 36%, 27% and 25% of our product shipments for the year ended December 31, 2016. If we were to lose the business of one or more of these distributors, if any of these distributors failed to fulfill their obligations, if any of these distributors experienced difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, or if any of these distributors negotiated lower pricing terms, it would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPharmaceutical marketing is subject to substantial regulation in the U.S. and any failure by us or our collaborative partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations could adversely affect our business .\nAll marketing activities associated with NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, Gralise, CAMBIA, Zipsor and Lazanda, as well as marketing activities related to any other products that we may acquire, or for which we obtain regulatory approval, will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform to statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition to FDA restrictions, the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs. For example, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Under this law, in recent years, the federal government has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs. Many states have similar statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and, in some states, such statutes or regulations apply regardless of the payer. If we, or our collaborative partners, fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our\nproducts, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, civil penalties, seizure of products, injunctions, and exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, as well as other regulatory actions against our product candidates, our collaborative partners or us.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs.\nCompanies may not promote drugs for \u201coff-label\u201d use-that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe drug products for off-label uses, and such off-label uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, the FDCA and FDA regulations restrict communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products by pharmaceutical companies. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the FDA, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) all actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label use and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. Such liabilities would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as divert management\u2019s attention from our business operations and damage our reputation.\nAcquisition of new and complementary businesses, products, and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. If we are unable to successfully identify and acquire such businesses, products or technologies, our business growth and prospects will be limited .\nSince June 2012, we have acquired NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, CAMBIA, Zipsor and Lazanda and exclusively in-licensed the right to develop and commercialize cebranopadol. An important element of our business strategy is to actively seek to acquire products or companies and to in-license or seek co-promotion rights to products that could be sold by our sales force. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify, pursue and complete any further acquisitions or whether we would be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees. If we are unable to enhance and broaden our product offerings, our business and prospects will be limited.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate any business, product or technology we may acquire, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nIntegrating any business, product or technology we acquire, including recently-acquired NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, is expensive, time consuming and can disrupt and adversely affect our ongoing business, including product sales, and distract our management. Our ability to successfully integrate any business, product or technology we acquire depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nminimize the disruption and distraction of our management and other employees, including our sales force, in connection with the integration of any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u00b7\nmaintain and increase sales of our existing products;\n\u00b7\nestablish or manage the transition of the manufacture and supply of any acquired product, including the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and components;\n\u00b7\nidentify and add the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory and other related personnel, capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u00b7\nmanage the transition and migration of all commercial, financial, legal, clinical, regulatory and other pertinent information relating to any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u00b7\ncomply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u00b7\nobtain and maintain adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing from managed care, government and other third-party payers with respect to any acquired product; and\n\u00b7\nmaintain and extend intellectual property protection for any acquired product or technology.\nIf we are unable to perform the above functions or otherwise effectively integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nIf we engage in strategic transactions that fail to achieve the anticipated results and synergies, our business will suffer.\nWe may seek to engage in strategic transactions with third parties, such as product or company acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures or business combinations. We may face significant competition in seeking potential strategic partners and transactions, and the negotiation process for acquiring any product or engaging in strategic transactions can be time-consuming and complex. Engaging in strategic transactions, such as our acquisition in 2015 of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, pose integration challenges and fail to achieve the anticipated results or synergies or distract our management and business, which may harm our business.\nAs part of an effort to acquire a product or company or to enter into other strategic transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying, evaluating and assessing material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining, evaluating and accurately assessing all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction. We may also assume liabilities and legal risks in connection with a transaction, including those relating to activities of the seller prior to the consummation of the transaction and contracts that we assume. Failure to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions or strategic transactions that we may consummate, or that we have completed, such as the acquisition in 2015 of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA, whether as a result of identified or unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks, governmental investigations, litigation or other events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. We believe this arises primarily as a result of wholesalers\u2019 reductions of inventory of our products in the first quarter and annual changes in health insurance plans that occur at the beginning of the calendar year.\nIn 2013, 2014 and 2015, our wholesalers ended the calendar year with higher levels of inventory of our products than at the end of the first quarter of the following year. As a result, in the first quarters of 2014, 2015 and 2016, net sales were lower than would otherwise have been the case as a result of the reduction of product inventory at our wholesalers. Any material reduction by our wholesalers of their inventory of our products in the first quarter of any calendar year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year, could adversely affect our operating results and may cause our stock price to decline.\nMany health insurance plans and government programs reset annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs at the beginning of each calendar year and require participants to pay for substantially all of the costs of medical services and prescription drug products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. In addition, enrollment in high-deductible health insurance plans has increased significantly in recent years. As a result of these factors, patients may delay filling or refilling prescriptions for our products or substitute less expensive generic products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. Any reduction in the demand for our products, including as a result of the foregoing factors, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of any future proxy fight or the actions of activist shareholders.\nOn October 17, 2016, we and Starboard entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which, among other things, (i) three independent directors appointed by Starboard joined our Board of Directors, (ii) we amended our bylaws to move the window for shareholders director nominations and other shareholder proposals for consideration at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders to March 15, 2017 through April 15, 2017 and (iii) Starboard agreed to withdraw its request for the Special Meeting scheduled to be held on November 15, 2016.\nAnother proxy contest or related activities with Starboard or other activist shareholders, could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;\n\u00b7\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition; and\n\u00b7\nif nominees advanced by activist shareholders are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans or to realize long-term value from our assets, and this could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA proxy contest could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. Further, if a proxy contest results in a change in control of our Board of Directors, such an event could give third parties certain rights under our existing contractual obligations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to disruptive unsolicited takeover attempts in the future.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to unsolicited attempts to gain control of our company. Responding to any such attempt would distract management attention away from our business and would require us to incur significant costs. Moreover, any unsolicited takeover attempt may disrupt our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees, producers, suppliers, customers, and other constituencies important to our success, which could negatively impact our financial results and business initiatives. Other disruptions to our business include potential volatility in our stock price and potential adverse impacts on the timing of, and our ability to consummate, acquisitions of products and companies.\nWe depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. If these suppliers are unable to manufacture and supply our products, or if there is insufficient availability of our products or the raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, our business will suffer.\nWe have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, CAMBIA, Zipsor, Lazanda and Gralise. An affiliate of Janssen Pharma is our sole supplier of NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA pursuant to a manufacturing supply agreement we entered into with such entity in April 2015. Patheon Puerto Rico Inc. (Patheon) is our sole supplier for Gralise pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement we entered into with Patheon in September 2011. Accucaps Industries Limited is our sole supplier for Zipsor pursuant to a manufacturing agreement we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Zipsor in June 2012. DPT Lakewood Inc. is our sole supplier for Lazanda pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Lazanda in July 2013. MiPharm, S.p.A is our sole supplier for CAMBIA pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of CAMBIA in December 2013. We do not have, and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future, internal commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Rather, we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for commercialization and clinical trials. Our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products and our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to obtain such products on a timely or competitive basis, if at all. Any stock out, or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, Gralise, CAMBIA, Zipsor or Lazanda, or the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components from our suppliers would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our suppliers are subject to numerous regulations, including current FDA regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or suppliers fail to perform as required or fail to comply with the regulations of the FDA and other applicable governmental authorities, our ability to deliver adequate supplies of our products to our customers on a timely basis, or to continue our clinical trials could be adversely affected. The manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers and suppliers may also be found to violate the proprietary rights of others. To the extent these risks materialize and adversely affect such third-party manufacturers\u2019 performance obligations to us, and we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable\nterms, or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers or suppliers, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property and may be liable for infringing the intellectual property of others.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies, and to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. We hold issued U.S. patents and have patent applications pending in the U.S. In addition, we are pursuing patent applications relating to our technologies in the U.S. and abroad. We have also applied for patents in numerous foreign countries. Some of those countries have granted our applications and other applications are still pending. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know-how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases, due to, among other things, the lack of an adequate remedy for breach of an agreement or a finding that an agreement is unenforceable. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing other patents or intellectual property rights. We are not aware of any such intellectual property claims against us. However, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Patents issued to third parties relating to sustained release drug formulations or particular pharmaceutical compounds could in the future be asserted against us, although we believe that we do not infringe any valid claim of any patents. If claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it was determined that these products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, we could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product, unless we can obtain a license, or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon such third party\u2019s patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we, our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us, even if such claims are without merit, could cause our stock price to decline.\nFrom time to time, we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents. Infringement of our patents by others may reduce our market shares (if a related product is approved) and, consequently, our potential future revenues and adversely affect our patent rights if we do not take appropriate enforcement action. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. For instance, we have previously been engaged in ANDA litigation involving NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA oral solution as well as Gralise. It is possible our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction or the PTAB. Whether or not the outcome of litigation or the PTAB proceeding is favorable to us, the litigation and the proceedings take significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We may also be required to participate in derivation proceedings or other post-grant proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the purposes of, respectively, determining the priority of inventions in connection with our patent applications or determining validity of claims in our issued patents. Adverse determinations in litigation or proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. If we need but cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from marketing the affected product.\nOur failure to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $820.0 million under the senior secured notes we issued in April 2015 (the Senior Notes) and the convertible notes we issued in September 2014 (the Convertible Notes). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance, the Convertible Notes, the Senior Notes and any additional debt obligations we may incur, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, which could result in a default on our obligations, including the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Senior Secured Notes or our other indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nresult in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Note Purchase Agreement, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u00b7\nsubject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including the Senior Notes;\n\u00b7\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including working capital, clinical trials, research and development, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nprevent us from raising funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes in the event we are required to do so following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d as specified in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, to repurchase the Senior Notes in the event we are required to do so following a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d or as required in the event that the principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes as of March 31, 2021 is greater than $100.0 million, as specified in the Note Purchase Agreement or to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash;\n\u00b7\nresult in dilution to our existing shareholders as a result of the conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of common stock;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u00b7\nput us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding possible acquisitions of, or investments in, additional products, technologies, and companies.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash, to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change or to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a major transaction put or as required in the event that the principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes as of March 31, 2021 is greater than $100.0 million.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain events, including events deemed to be a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted.\nFurthermore, holders of the Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of their Senior Notes (i) if the principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes as of March 31, 2021 is greater than $100.0 million, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, or (ii) upon the occurrence of certain events deemed to be a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d at a repurchase price equal to: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus (b) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus (c) a prepayment premium, which may be substantial.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes or Senior Notes or pay cash with respect to Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. An event of default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, including our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes when required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, would constitute a default under the Note Purchase Agreement. In addition, an event of default under the Note Purchase Agreement, including our failure to repurchase Senior Notes when the repurchase is required by the Note Purchase Agreement, would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or a major transaction under the Note Purchase Agreement could constitute an event of default under either the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the Note Purchase Agreement, as applicable and any agreements that may govern any future indebtedness. Following an event of default, if the payment of our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness.\nHealth care reform could increase our expenses and adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nThe ACA includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies. For example, the ACA seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The ACA also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit and an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S. The ACA also requires increased disclosure obligations and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics and contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. The ACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. These and other aspects of the ACA, including regulations that may be imposed in connection with the implementation of the ACA, such as the 340B Program, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nMany members of Congress and President Trump have pledged to repeal the ACA. Any new laws or regulations that have the effect of imposing additional costs or regulatory burden on pharmaceutical manufacturers, or otherwise negatively affect the industry, would adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, President Trump has indicated that reducing the price of prescription drugs will be a priority of his administration. The implementation of any price controls or caps on prescription drugs, whether at the federal level or state level, would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products or product candidates, we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products, and our business will suffer.\nThe regulatory process is expensive and time consuming. Even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials, we may not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and the FDA may not\nagree with our methods of clinical data analysis or our conclusions regarding safety and/or efficacy. Significant clinical trial delays could impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections. Even if we receive regulatory approval, this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product.\nFurther, with respect to our approved products, once regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation and inspection, including compliance with FDA regulations governing current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or Quality System Regulation (QSR). The FDCA, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) and other federal and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In addition, with respect to Lazanda\u00ae, we and our partners are also subject to ongoing DEA regulatory obligations, including annual registration renewal, security, recordkeeping, theft and loss reporting, periodic inspection and annual quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our products. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, non-renewal of marketing applications or authorizations or criminal prosecution, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of the FDA or other empowered regulatory agencies. For example, in June 2010, we instituted a voluntary class 2 recall of 52 lots of our 500mg Glumetza product after chemical traces of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) were found in the product bottle.\nWe are subject to risks associated with NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nThe products we develop or acquire generally are or will be submitted for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Gralise relies on the FDA\u2019s prior approval of Neurontin, the immediate release formulation of gabapentin initially approved by the FDA.\nFor NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as \u201cParagraph IV certifications,\u201d that certify any patents listed in the Orange Book publication in respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) application. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of the NDA which the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one-time automatic 30-month stay of the FDA\u2019s ability to approve the 505(b)(2) application. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such products may be commercialized, if at all. A Section 505(b)(2) application may also not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new formulation for all or only some of the indications sought by us. The FDA may also reject our future Section 505(b)(2) submissions and require us to file such submissions under Section 501(b)(1) of the FDCA, which could be considerably more expensive and time consuming. These factors, among others, may limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIf a product liability claim against us is successful, our business will suffer.\nOur business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development production and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse of any of our products could result in patient injury or death. For instance, Lazanda is a self-administered, opioid analgesic that contains fentanyl, a Schedule II \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under the CSA. A patient\u2019s failure to follow instructions on the use and administration of, or the abuse of Lazanda could result in injury or death. In addition, patients using Lazanda have been diagnosed with cancer, an often fatal disease. Patient injury or death can result in product liability claims being brought against us, even if our products did not cause an injury or death. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others who come into contact with our products.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance for sales of our products and clinical trials currently underway, but:\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future products;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of our Acuform gastric retentive technology expands; or\n\u00b7\nour insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nOur inability to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management\u2019s attention from conducting our business. If third parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms, contract interpretation and ownership or protection of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nWe currently have collaboration or license arrangements with a number of companies, including Gr\u00fcnenthal, Janssen Pharma and Ironwood. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future enter into other collaborative arrangements, some of which have been based on less definitive agreements, such as memoranda of understanding, material transfer agreements, options or feasibility agreements. We may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements.\nCollaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of the parties, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations, especially when the applicable collaborative provisions have not been fully negotiated and documented. Such disputes can delay collaborative research, development or commercialization of potential products, and can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration. The terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations. Additionally, the collaborative partners under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to maintain, protect or prevent infringement of the licensed patents or our other intellectual property rights by third parties. Moreover, negotiating collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate, which could cause us to enter into less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs. Any failure by our collaborative partners to abide by the terms of their respective agreements with us, including their failure to accurately calculate, report or pay any royalties payable to us, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, which could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future products and technologies. Other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include:\n\u00b7\nany parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products;\n\u00b7\narrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies;\n\u00b7\npremature termination of a collaboration agreement; or\n\u00b7\nfailure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using our current and potential future products and technologies.\nOur collaborative arrangements do not necessarily restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products. Our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products.\nAny failure by us or our partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations relating to controlled substances could adversely affect our business.\nEach of NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA are opioid analgesics that contain tapentadol. Lazanda is an opioid analgesic that contains fentanyl. Cebranopadol is a development stage opioid analgesic. Tapentadol and fentanyl are regulated \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d under the CSA. The CSA establishes, among other things, certain registration, production quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances being those that present the highest risk of abuse. Each of tapentadol and fentanyl are listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. The scheduling for cebranopadol will not be determined until after the FDA\u2019s approval. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use, among other things, of controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, generally all Schedule II substance prescriptions, such as prescriptions for fentanyl, must be written and signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nThe DEA also conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Facilities that conduct research, manufacture, distribute, import or export controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations and in certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings against us or our manufacturing and distribution partners, and our respective employees, officers and directors.\nIn addition to federal regulations, many individual states also have controlled substances laws. Although state controlled substances laws generally mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions they may separately schedule our products. Any failure by us or our partners to obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute fentanyl or to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLimitations on the production of Schedule II substances in the U.S. could limit our ability to successfully commercialize NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA and Lazanda.\nThe availability and production of all Schedule II substances, including tapentadol and fentanyl, is limited by the DEA through a quota system that includes a national aggregate quota, production quotas for individual manufacturers and procurement quotas that authorize the procurement of specific quantities of Schedule II controlled substances for use in drug manufacturing. The DEA annually establishes an aggregate quota for total tapentadol and total fentanyl production in the U.S. based on the DEA\u2019s estimate of the quantity needed to meet commercial and scientific need. The aggregate quota of tapentadol and fentanyl that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. annually is allocated among applicable individual drug manufacturers, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production quotas. In turn, the manufacturers of NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA and Lazanda have to obtain a procurement quota to source tapentadol and fentanyl for the production of NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA and Lazanda, respectively.\nThe DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas for these activities. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Based on a variety of factors, including public policy considerations, the DEA may set the aggregate quota lower for tapentadol or fentanyl than the total amount requested by individual manufacturers. Although through our manufacturing partner we are permitted to ask the DEA to increase our manufacturer\u2019s procurement quota after it is initially established, we cannot be certain that the DEA would act favorably upon such a request. In addition, our manufacturers obtain a procurement quota for tapentadol or fentanyl for all tapentadol or fentanyl products manufactured at their facility, which is allocated to NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA and Lazanda, as applicable, at the manufacturer\u2019s discretion. If the available quota of tapentadol or fentanyl is insufficient to meet our commercial demand or clinical needs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, during the 2016 presidential campaign, President Trump called for the DEA to restrict the amount of opioids that can be manufactured in the U.S. Any delay or refusal by the DEA or our manufacturers in establishing the production or procurement quota or any reduction by the DEA or our manufacturer in the allocated quota for tapentadol or fentanyl could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program may limit the commercial success of NUCYNTA ER and Lazanda.\nNUCYNTA ER and Lazanda are subject to a FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) protocol that requires enrollment and participation in the REMS program to prescribe, dispense or distribute such products for outpatient use. Lazanda is subject to a REMS protocol that is specific to Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) medicines for outpatient use. Many physicians, health care practitioners and pharmacies are unwilling to enroll and participate in the REMS programs. As a result, there are relatively few prescribers and dispensers of products subject to REMS protocols, and in particular, TIRF products. If we are not able to successfully promote NUCYNTA ER and Lazanda to participants in the applicable REMS program, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile. Our results of operations may fluctuate and affect our stock price.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. From December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2016, our stock price has ranged from $12.25 to $33.74 per share.\nFactors affecting our operating results and that could adversely affect our stock price include:\n\u00b7\nthe degree of commercial success and market acceptance of NUCYNTA ER, NUCYNTA, Gralise, CAMBIA, Zipsor and Lazanda;\n\u00b7\nfilings and other regulatory or governmental actions or proceedings related to our products and product candidates and those of our collaborative partners;\n\u00b7\nthe reversal or any appeal of the court\u2019s favorable ruling in our patent infringement litigation against the filers of ANDAs for NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, infringement allegations, inter party review proceedings and litigation matters;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nour and our collaborative partners\u2019 compliance or non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and with obligations under our collaborative agreements;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully execute our sales and marketing startegies, including our recent sales force realignment we undertook in the first quarter of 2017;\n\u00b7\nour plans to acquire, in-license or co-promote other products, compounds or acquire or combine with other companies, and our degree of success in realizing the intended advantages of, and mitigating any risks associated with, any such transaction;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a product containing cebranopadol;\n\u00b7\nadverse events related to our products, including recalls;\n\u00b7\ninterruptions of manufacturing or supply, or other manufacture or supply difficulties;\n\u00b7\nvariations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements, including milestone payments, royalties, license fees and other contract revenues;\n\u00b7\nadverse events or circumstances related to our peer companies, our industry or the markets for our products;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome of our patent infringement litigation against Purdue;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome and impact of any proxy contest initiated by Starboard or other activist shareholder;\n\u00b7\nour compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ndecisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of a collaboration or program;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our Convertible Notes; and\n\u00b7\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results are measured, presented and compare to analyst expectations.\nAs a result of these factors, our stock price may continue to be volatile and investors may be unable to sell their shares at a price equal to, or above, the price paid. Any significant drops in our stock price could give rise to shareholder lawsuits, which are costly and time consuming to defend against and which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital while the suits are pending, even if the suits are ultimately resolved in our favor.\nIn addition, if the market for pharmaceutical stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. For example, if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our stock or publishes an inaccurate research report about our company, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future.\nTo date, we have recorded revenues from product sales, license fees, royalties, collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies. In 2016 and 2015 we incurred a net loss of $88.7 million and $75.7 million, respectively and in 2014 we recognized net income of $131.8 million. We expect to incur operating losses in 2017 and may continue to incur operating losses in future years. Any such losses may have an adverse impact on our total assets, shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our future operations or product acquisitions and strategic transactions that we may pursue.\nWe fund our operations primarily through revenues from product sales and do not have any committed sources of capital. To the extent that our existing capital resources and revenues from ongoing operations are insufficient to fund our future operations, or product acquisitions and strategic transactions that we may pursue, we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, through additional debt financing, from development and licensing arrangements or from the sale of assets. We may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 equity positions.\nThe development of drug candidates such as cebranopadol is inherently difficult and uncertain and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates or those of our collaborative partners will be approved for marketing or, if approved, will achieve market acceptance.\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and failures. As a condition to regulatory approval, each product candidate must undergo extensive and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate to a statistically significant degree that the product candidate is safe and effective. The results at any stage of the development process may lack the desired safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetic characteristics. Positive or encouraging results of prior clinical trials are not necessarily indicative of the results obtained in later clinical trials, as was the case with the Phase 3 trial for Gralise for the management of PHN that we completed in 2007, and with the Phase 3 trials evaluating Sefelsa, our prior product candidate, for menopausal hot flashes, the last of which we\ncompleted in October 2011. Further, product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed in development. In addition, data obtained from pivotal clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nOur own product candidates, including cebranopadol, and those of our collaborative partners are subject to the risk that any or all of them may be found to be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. The FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies may determine that our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval and require us to engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis, which may be costly and time-consuming. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials. If our current or future product candidates fail at any stage of development, they will not receive regulatory approval, we will not be able to commercialize them and we will not receive any return on our investment in those product candidates.\nOther factors could delay or result in the termination of our current and future clinical trials and related development programs, including:\n\u00b7\nnegative or inconclusive results;\n\u00b7\npatient noncompliance with the protocol;\n\u00b7\nadverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nFDA inspections of our clinical operations;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our third party clinical trial vendors to comply with applicable regulatory laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ninability of our third party clinical trial vendors to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations, comply with applicable laws and regulations or meet deadlines;\n\u00b7\ndelays or failures in obtaining clinical materials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays or failures in recruiting qualified patients to participate in our clinical trials; and\n\u00b7\nactual or perceived lack of efficacy or safety of the product candidate.\nWe are unable to predict whether any of our product candidates, including cebranopadol, or those of our collaborative partners will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully manufactured or marketed. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained, the time frame for commercializing a product is long and uncertain. Even if these other product candidates receive regulatory clearance, our products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. If it is discovered that the Acuform technology could have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective as a delivery system for drugs or therapeutics, our product development efforts and our business could be significantly harmed.\nEven assuming our products obtain regulatory approval, successful commercialization requires:\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance;\n\u00b7\ncost-effective commercial scale production; and\n\u00b7\nreimbursement under private or governmental health plans.\nAny material delay or failure in the governmental approval process and/or the successful commercialization of our potential products or those of our collaborative partners could adversely impact our financial position and liquidity.\nWe depend on third party contract research organizations, clinical investigators and clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials, and if they do not perform their regulatory, legal and contractual obligations, or successfully enroll patients in and manage our clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, including cebranopadol.\nWe rely on third party contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in designing, managing, monitoring and otherwise conducting our clinical trials. We do not control these third parties and, as a result, we may be unable to control the amount and timing of resources that they devote to our clinical trials.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol, as well as the FDA\u2019s and\nother applicable regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements, including good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. If we, contract research organizations or other third parties assisting us with our clinical trials fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, or other applicable regulatory agencies, may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with good clinical practices. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our product manufacturers, to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat or redesign clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe also rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedule, we will be unable to complete these trials or to complete them as planned, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nOur agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing and for trial management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and senior management with whom we do not have employment agreements.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, James A. Schoeneck, and other members of our executive management team, and on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel. We do not have agreements with Mr. Schoeneck or any of our other executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us. We may have difficulty filling open senior commercial, scientific and financial positions. Management, scientific and operating personnel are in high demand in our industry and are often subject to competing offers. The loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could result in delays in the research, development, and commercialization of our products and potential product candidates.\nIf we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls, our stock price could suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, we must perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, include in our annual report the results of the evaluation and have our external auditors also publicly attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses are found in our internal controls in the future, if we fail to complete future evaluations on time or if our external auditors cannot attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting requirements and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration assumed as part of our acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nContingent consideration obligations arise from the Zipsor, CAMBIA and Lazanda acquisitions and relate to the potential future milestone payments and royalties payable under the respective agreements. The contingent consideration is initially recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The estimates of fair values for the contingent consideration contain uncertainties as it involves assumptions about the probability assigned to the potential milestones and royalties being achieved and the discount rate. Significant judgment is employed in\ndetermining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital within shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if the Convertible Notes become convertible, we are required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than a long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Finally, we use the if-converted method to compute diluted earnings per share with respect to our convertible debt, which could more dilutive than assuming the debt would be settled in cash as opposed to shares.\nAny of these factors could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Convertible Notes and the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, the Senior Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement, could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change under the indenture for the Convertible Notes or a major transaction under the Note Purchase Agreement, holders of the Convertible Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d under the indenture, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. In any of these cases, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the indenture, the Senior Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement, as well as provisions of our organizational documents and other agreements, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nProvisions in our restated articles of incorporation, bylaws, and California law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California General Corporation Law could discourage a third party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, control of our company without approval of our board of directors. These provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain provisions allow the Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock.\nOn July 12, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted and approved an amendment and restatement to our Bylaws (the Amended Bylaws). The Amended Bylaws, among other things, provide for the establishment of a measurement record date for purposes of ascertaining shareholders eligible to call for a special meeting of shareholders and establish certain other procedures relating to the calling of a special meeting of shareholders. The Amended Bylaws also supplement the advanced notice requirements and procedures for the submission by shareholders of nominations for the board of directors and of other proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings, and provide that the exclusive forum for any shareholder to bring any: (i) derivative action, (ii) claim asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) action under the California Corporations Code or the our organizational documents or (iv) other action relating to our internal affairs, shall in each case be the Santa Clara County Superior Court within the State of California or, if no state court located within the State of California has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the Northern District of California. The Amended Bylaws also make certain other ministerial changes.\nWe are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law, which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed \u201cinterested party\u201d reorganization transaction.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns on shares of our common stock will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations and infrastructure, and those of our partners, third party suppliers and vendors are vulnerable to damage or interruption from cyber-attacks and security breaches, human error, natural disasters, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, intentional acts of theft, vandalism, terrorism and similar events. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay area, which has a history of seismic activity. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our computer networks and information technology systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack and motive (including corporate espionage). Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications and those of our third party vendors may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\nIt is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information, including the information of our business partners. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our network security and data recovery measures and those of our third party vendors may not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our business.", "PERMNO": 85686, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ASRT"}
