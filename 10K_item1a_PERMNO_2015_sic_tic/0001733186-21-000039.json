You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial but are in fact material, occur, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or a part of the value of your ownership in our common stock. Some statements in this Annual Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this Annual Report entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisk Factor Summary:\nThe risk factors detailed in Item 1A entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Below is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A. This summary does not address every aspect of our risks factors, all of the risks that we face, or other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial.\n\u2022Our estimate of total addressable market is subject to numerous uncertainties. If we have overestimated the size of our total addressable market now or in the future, our future growth rate may be limited.\n\u2022Our reported order intake and the value of our order book are not necessarily indicative of future net sales revenues and are subject to a number of uncertainties. If the order intake fails to translate into future net sales revenue it may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022A prolonged recession and/or a downturn in LVP could adversely affect our business and require impairments or restructuring actions or require us to seek additional sources of financing to continue our operations, which may not be available to us or be available only on materially different terms than what has historically been available.\n\u2022Changes in our product mix may impact our financial performance.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected by regulations affecting the automobile safety and autonomous driving markets.\n\u2022We may not be able to anticipate changing customer and consumer preferences or respond quickly enough to changes in technology and standards to be able to develop and introduce commercially viable products.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.\n\u2022We may not be able to adequately protect or monetize our intellectual property rights in internally-developed or acquired technologies, which could result in the loss of our rights, limit our ability to compete, increased costs lost revenue.\n\u2022We operate in developing and highly competitive markets.\n\u2022Escalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost significant customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices.\n\u2022Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022Disruptions in our supply or delivery chain, or those of our customers, could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022Changes in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins.\n\u2022We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us or our customers.\n\u2022We face risks in connection with identifying and successfully completing strategic acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies and/or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient resources to fund our operating costs or all of our future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions or joint ventures.\n\u2022Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could limit our business plan or adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected if our policies and procedures do not adequately protect our employees or others or otherwise meet the requirements of applicable laws or regulations.\n\u2022We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\n\u2022Our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by COVID-19.\n\u2022Impairment charges relating to our assets, goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022We face risks related to our defined benefit pension plans and employee benefit plans, including the need for additional funding as well as higher costs and liabilities.\n\u2022Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our products or business operations, result in damages or loss of confidence in our products, or the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\u2022Our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\n\u2022or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\n\u2022The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\n\u2022Future issuances of common stock by us may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022Your ownership in our common stock may be diluted by additional equity issuances.\n\u2022We have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and certain factors could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\n\u2022Veoneer SDR holders do not have the same rights as our stockholders.\nRisks Related to our Industry & Global Market\nOur estimate of total addressable market is subject to numerous uncertainties. If we have overestimated the size of our total addressable market now or in the future, our future growth rate may be limited.\nThe Company\u2019s estimates of total addressable market, or TAM, are based on a variety of inputs, including production estimates per product group (which are largely based on global light vehicle production (LVP) data and estimates from IHS Markit), content per vehicle, or CPV, estimates, the Company\u2019s own market insights, estimates as to the pace and extent of standard-setting and regulatory change, internal market intelligence on prices and penetration/adoption rates of each expected product group and the Company\u2019s history operating in the market (including, among other things, its order and bid experience).\nWe have not independently verified any third-party information, including LVP estimates by IHS Markit, and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. While we believe our market size estimates are reasonable, such information is inherently imprecise. For example, IHS Markit\u2019s January 2021 estimates of LVP for 2021-2024 were reduced by approximately 69 million vehicles compared to forecasts in July 2018 (around the time of the completion of our spin-off from Autoliv). If IHS Markit or other third-party or internally-generated data used in our estimates proves to be inaccurate or we make errors in our assumptions based on such data, our actual market may be more limited than our estimates. In addition, these inaccuracies or errors may cause us to misallocate capital and other critical business resources, which could harm our business. Even if our total addressable market meets our size estimates and experiences growth, we may not continue to grow our share of the market. Our growth is subject to many factors, including the successful implementation of our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the estimates of our TAM included in this Annual Report should not be taken as indicative of our ability to grow our business.\nOur reported order intake and the value of our order book are not necessarily indicative of future net sales revenues and are subject to a number of uncertainties. If the order intake fails to translate into future net sales revenue it may adversely affect our business.\nWe monitor order intake to make certain predictions related to our capital needs and expenditures and in providing long-term targets, earnings guidance and estimates. Our order intake is the estimated future average annual sales attributable to documented new business awarded based on estimated average annual product volumes, average annual sales price for such products over their anticipated life, and exchange rates. Order intake is not recorded as revenue until the order is completed. The aggregate value of order intake is considered our \u201corder book\u201d and is part of it until the products are manufactured and delivered to customers and we realize net sales revenue from such orders. Since the general lead time from an \u201corder\u201d to the start of production in the automotive industry is three to four years, and it may take several more months for production of a certain vehicle model to fully ramp up, the assumptions we use to determine order intake may no longer be accurate at the time production begins or the order is completed.\nTo determine our estimated order intake, we make several assumptions related to vehicle production in a particular year of a particular model, annual product values, sales prices for such products and exchange rates. If any of the inputs to these assumptions fail to materialize as we expect, the net sales revenue actually realized may be adversely impacted. We cannot predict when our customers will decide to either increase or reduce inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Our customers generally do not guarantee order volumes. The commercial success of the vehicle models that include our products will also impact whether our order intake translates into net sales revenue. Finally, any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP by our customers, whether due to general economic conditions or any other factors relevant to sales or LVP, will likely have a material adverse effect on whether net sales revenue is ultimately realized from our estimated order book.\nA prolonged recession and/or a downturn in LVP could adversely affect our business and require impairments or restructuring actions, or require us to seek additional sources of financing to continue our operations, which may not be available to us or be available only on materially different terms than what has historically been available.\nOur business is related to global LVP and automotive sales and LVP are critical drivers for our sales. The automotive market experienced a significant decline in LVP during 2020 and has just recently started to show indications of recovery. A prolonged downturn in or uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions, including as a result of the coronavirus global pandemic (COVID-19), or any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP by our customers, may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a substantial number of important product and program launches in the next 18 months. These launches are important from both a sales and cash flow perspective. A downturn in global economic conditions or LVP, or uncertainty with respect thereto, could delay our customers' production plans and/or volumes and the return on our investment in R&D and the resources expended to ensure timely and quality launches. Given the high costs of such investments, such a downtown, and any losses resulting from customer defaults, could result in us experiencing a significant negative cash flow.\nAny such adverse impacts could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges, restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating global economic conditions and/or deteriorating performance of our business may also have a negative impact on our market capitalization, which could also result in impairment charges. For example, given our market capitalization, further decreases in our market capitalization may necessitate additional impairment testing. A determination of that an impairment has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAny significant negative cash flow could also result in us having insufficient funds to continue our operations unless we can procure external financing, which may not be possible. Our ability to obtain external financing on favorable terms could be limited by instability in the global credit markets and global economic pressure. If external financing is unavailable to us when necessary, we may have insufficient funds to continue our operations.\nChanges in our product mix may impact our financial performance.\nWe sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. Our earnings guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix based on market expectations. There is a risk that the mix of offerings by our customers and demand for such offerings could change. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, it could have an unfavorable impact on our revenue and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by regulations affecting the automobile safety and autonomous driving markets.\nGovernment vehicle safety regulations are a key driver in our business. Historically, these regulations have imposed ever more stringent safety regulations for vehicles. Safety regulations have a positive impact on driver awareness and acceptance of active safety products and technology. These more stringent safety regulations often require vehicles to have more safety CPV and more advanced safety products, including active safety and driver assistance technology, which is a growth driver for the Company.\nHowever, because growth in global LVP is highly concentrated in markets such as China and India, which have historically required less safety CPV, our results of operation may suffer if the safety CPV remains low in our growth markets. As safety CPV is also an indicator of our sales development, if this trend continues, the average safety systems per vehicle could decline.\nChanges in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements related to vehicle safety content may also render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive to our customers. Vehicle safety content requirements are subject to change based on a number of factors that are not within our control, including new scientific or medical data, adverse publicity regarding autonomous vehicles or technology, domestic and foreign political developments or considerations, and litigation relating to our products and our competitors\u2019 products. Changes in government regulations in response to these and other considerations could have a severe impact on our business. If government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing regulations, our business may suffer material adverse effects.\nThe regulatory obligation of complying with safety regulations could increase as federal and local regulators impose more stringent compliance and reporting requirements in response to product recalls, safety issues and product innovations in our industry. In the U.S., we are subject to the existing Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act, which requires manufacturers to comply with \u201cEarly Warning\u201d requirements by reporting to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) information related to defects or reports of death related to their products. TREAD imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards. In September 2016, U.S. Department of Transportation issued a Federal Automated Vehicles Policy as agency guidance for comment rather than in a rulemaking in order to enable the delivery of an initial regulatory framework and best practices to guide manufacturers and other entities in the safe design, development, testing, and deployment of highly automated vehicles. Since September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued voluntary \u201cguidance\u201d for autonomous vehicle (AV) standards, including \u201cEnsuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies - Automated Vehicles 4.0\u201d dated January 2020, to promote autonomous vehicle development. It is unknown when specific U.S. regulations for AVs may be released and what, if any, impact such regulations may have on us or our customers in terms of products, features and performance requirements.\nAs our technologies advance and develop beyond traditional automotive products, we may be subject to regulatory regimes beyond traditional vehicle safety rules and requirements. As a result, we may not identify all regulatory licenses or permits required for our products, or our products may operate beyond the scope of the licenses and permits we have obtained. Failing to obtain the required licenses, permits or other regulatory authorizations could result in investigations, fines or other penalties or proceedings. If any of the regulatory risks described above materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is exposed to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including locating certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities internationally, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. International sales and operations subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including exposure to local economic and political conditions, foreign tax consequences, issues with enforcing legal agreements, currency controls, imposition of tariffs, supply chain issues, preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products, and concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and the environmental impact in foreign countries where our products are produced and raw materials and/or components are sourced. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nFor example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations, including, inter alia, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and a new minimum tax calculated on certain U.S. outbound payments. We have completed our accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 22, 2018 based on published guidance. We expect that the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), and state tax authorities will be issuing additional guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered, and such guidance may be different from our current\ninterpretation. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. Changes in tax laws or policies by foreign jurisdictions could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the prior U.S. administration initiated substantial changes in U.S. trade policy and U.S. trade agreements, including the initiation of tariffs on certain foreign goods, and created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and certain of its trading partners. It is not yet clear how the new U.S. administration may alter or otherwise affect these relationships. The U.S entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on July 1, 2020. The USMCA changes the automotive rules of origin that dictate what percentage of an automobile must be built from parts that originated from countries in the North American region. The automotive industry is highly dependent on duty-free trade within the USMCA free trade region. A trade war, trade barriers or other governmental actions related to tariffs, international trade agreements, import or export restrictions or other trade policies could adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, therefore, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate risks.\nWe have currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are particularly vulnerable to a strong U.S. dollar as certain raw materials and components are sourced in U.S. dollars while sales are also currently in other currencies, like the Euro. Our risks include:\n\u2022transaction exposure, which arises because the cost of a product originates in one currency and is sold in another currency;\n\u2022revaluation effects, which arise from valuation of assets denominated in currencies than the unit reporting currency;\n\u2022translation exposure in the income statement, which arises when the income statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022translation exposure in the balance sheet, which arises when the balance sheets of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars; and\n\u2022changes in the reported U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows.\nFor example, in 2020 the Company\u2019s gross transaction exposure was approximately $0.9 billion, with a net exposure of $0.6 billion due to counter-flows. The largest net transaction exposures were the sale of Euro against the U.S. Dollar, the purchase of U.S. Dollar against Korean Won and the sale of Euro against Romanian Leu. In 2020, the five largest currency pairs accounted for approximately 86% of the Company\u2019s net currency transaction exposure. These exchange rate risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Technology and Product Development\nWe may not be able to anticipate changing customer and consumer preferences or respond quickly enough to changes in technology and standards to be able to develop and introduce commercially viable products.\nOur ability to maintain and improve existing products, anticipate changes in technology, regulatory and other standards, and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced technologies and products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to be competitive and gain market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful or are less successful than our competitors in predicting the course of market development and perceptions of drivers regarding autonomous driving capabilities and solutions, developing innovative products, processes, and/or use of materials, or adapting to new technologies or evolving regulatory, industry or customer requirements, we will suffer from a competitive disadvantage. Further, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, including the development of combined software and system-on-chip (SoC) hardware solutions to handle the influx of information coming into vehicles from increasing numbers of sensors and efficiently manage multilevel processing in real time while operating within a system's power budget. As a result, the success of portions of our business requires us to develop, acquire and/or incorporate new technologies. We may need to adjust our strategy and projected timelines based on how these technological challenges evolve over time. There is a risk that these challenges will not be overcome, and that our investments in R&D initiatives will not lead to successful new products and a corresponding increase in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to meet the expectations of our customers with respect to the timely development and performance of new technologies.\nBecause our products are technologically complex and innovative, it can take a significant amount of time to complete development. Development delays resulting from the challenges of integrating new functionality into vehicles and the evolution of our customers\u2019 performance requirements during the development cycle subject us to the risk that our customers cancel or postpone a contract in the time period that it takes us to begin production of a particular product. If we are unable to develop and deliver innovative and competitive products, or unable to do so with desired performance characteristics within the same timeframe as our competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.\nWe may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errors. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, scaling our business has become increasingly critical to our success as OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms and sought to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. We are investing in technologies that are intended to become the architecture for other products. If we are not able to scale according to our current expected timelines and needs of our current and prospective customers, we will lose the trust of our customers and our customer relationships may suffer.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or monetize our intellectual property rights in internally-developed or acquired technologies, which could result in the loss of our rights, limit our ability to compete, increased costs, and lost revenue.\nWe have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to our products and rely on a number of patents to protect our intellectual property rights in such technology. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. In addition to our in-house research and development efforts, we have acquired and may continue to seek to acquire, rights to new intellectual property through corporate acquisitions, asset acquisitions, licensing and joint venture arrangements. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business. If claims alleging patent, copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and are successfully prosecuted against us, they could result in substantial costs.\nIf we are not able to protect our owned or licensed intellectual property rights against infringement or unauthorized use, we could lose those rights and/or incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights. Our means of protecting our intellectual property may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, or design around the patents we own or license. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the U.S. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our products utilize components that are developed by third parties and licensed to us or our joint ventures. If claims alleging patent, copyright or trademark infringement are brought against such licensors and successfully prosecuted, they could result in substantial costs, and we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these licensors. Alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us may not be available in a timely manner, may not provide the same functions as currently provided or may be more expensive than products currently used. Additionally, there is a risk that any patents owned or licensed by us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, limiting competitive advantage of affected products or technologies. Furthermore, as part of our business strategy, we may from time to time seek to acquire businesses or assets that provide us with additional intellectual property and technological advantages. We may experience problems integrating acquired technologies into our existing technologies and products, and such acquired intellectual property may be subject to known or contingent liabilities such as infringement claims. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we develop proprietary technologies internally, as well as through contract arrangements and research collaborations with third parties, there is a risk that our attempts to protect this proprietary information using agreements containing confidentiality, non-disclosure and/or non-use provisions will be unsuccessful. Even if agreements are entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized\ndisclosure or use of proprietary information. If we increase the value our intellectual property acquired through collaborations and development agreements, more of the technology we depend on could be subject to risks related to protecting these rights.\nSome of our products and technologies may use \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our products or require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses.\nSome of our products and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Additionally, open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software in such a way with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty.\nIf these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Customer Relationships and Competition\nWe operate in developing and highly competitive markets.\nThe market in which we operate are highly competitive. Active safety and driver assistance technology is a developing segment in the automotive industry and is expected to act as a basis for, and enable the development and introduction of, commercially viable autonomous vehicles. Among other factors, our products compete on the basis of price, quality, manufacturing and distribution capability, design and performance, technological innovation, delivery and service. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in large part, on our ability to innovate and manufacture products that have commercial success with consumers, differentiate our products from those of our competitors, deliver quality products in the time frames required by our customers, create confidence in our financial stability and achieve best-cost production.\nWe compete with a number of companies that design, produce and sell similar products. Some of our competitors as well as some of our customers have strategic relationships with other customers or outside partners, enabling them to pool resources. Some of our competitors are subsidiaries (or divisions, units or similar) of companies that are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than us. Additionally, some of our competitors may also have \u201cpreferred status\u201d as a result of special relationships or ownership interests with certain customers. Furthermore, the number of competitors may increase as suppliers from outside the traditional automotive industry, such as Waymo, Argo, Lyft, Cruise, Samsung, Panasonic, Here, Tesla, Intel, NVIDIA and other technology companies, consider the significant business opportunities presented by autonomous driving. The evolving nature of the competitive landscape creates greater uncertainty than the traditional automotive market.\nFurthermore, our ability to create confidence in our customers and potential customers that we have the financial strength and resources to support their ambitious programs and can timely deliver quality products over the life of a vehicle program will also be a significant factor in our ability to be competitive. Because the supply chain in our industry is very complex and many of our competitors have greater financial resources, our customers and potential customers may consider us as a supply risk and become concerned that we will be unable to continue to provide products to them at a quality level that meets their needs. If we are unable to create confidence in our financial position, customers may choose other suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProducts and services provided by companies outside the automotive industry may also reduce demand for our products, which require substantial investment in research and development. For example, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. Today, in most markets, active safety products are considered to be premium equipment rather than standard automotive safety items, which can create significant volatility in demand for certain of our products.\nThe discontinuation, lack of commercial success, or loss of business with respect to a customer or particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability.\nA number of our customer contracts require us to supply a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly facilities, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life\nof the model, which is generally four to seven years. These contracts are often subject to renegotiation, sometimes as frequent as on an annual basis, which may affect product pricing, and generally may be terminated by our customers at any time. The unpredictable nature of such customer contracts has made, and may continue to make, our sales variable. Furthermore, the discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of a customer or particular vehicle model or brand for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability.\nEscalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business.\nThe automotive supplier industry continues to experience increasingly aggressive pricing pressure from OEMs. This trend is partly attributable to the major automobile manufacturers\u2019 strong purchasing power. As an automotive component manufacturer, we may be expected to quote fixed prices or be forced to accept prices with annual price reduction commitments for long-term sales arrangements or discounted reimbursements for engineering work. Price reductions may impact our sales revenue and profit margins. Our future profitability will depend upon, among other things, our ability to successfully design and market technological improvements while maintaining our cost structure and reducing our cost per unit. If we are unable to offset continued price reductions, these price reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost significant customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices.\nWe are dependent on a few large customers with strong purchasing power. Business with any given customer is typically split into several contracts (either on the basis of one contract per vehicle model or on a broader platform basis). Additionally, we have no fixed volume commitments from our customers. Thus, even if we have won a bid for business from a customer, there are no guaranteed purchase volumes. The loss of business from any of our largest customers (whether by lower overall demand for vehicles, cancellation of existing contracts or the failure to award us new business) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomers may put us on a \u201cnew business hold,\u201d which limits our ability to quote or be awarded all or part of their future vehicle contracts if quality or other issues arise in the vehicles for which we were a supplier. Such new business holds range in length and scope and are generally accompanied by a certain set of remedial conditions that must be met before we are eligible to bid for new business. Meeting any such conditions within the prescribed timeframe may require additional Company resources. A failure to satisfy any such conditions may have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the long term.\nIf one or more of our customers\u2019 facilities cease production or decrease their production volumes, the assets we carry related to our facilities serving such customers may decrease in value because we may no longer be able to utilize or realize them as intended. Where such decreases are significant, such impairments may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThere is also a risk that one or more of our largest customers are unable to pay our invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments given its financial difficulties. If a large customer becomes subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, or if a large customer otherwise successfully procures protection against us legally enforcing its obligations, it is likely that we will be forced to record a substantial loss.\nOur business in China is subject to especially aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions as well as restrictions placed on foreign automakers.\nWe operate in the highly competitive automotive supply market in China and face competition from both international and smaller domestic manufacturers. Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Our business is sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes and growth in China and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. We anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, may seek to enter the Chinese market, resulting in increased competition. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the levels of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates than those previously experienced. Furthermore, the Chinese government has increased demand for domestic production of electric cars by offering purchase incentives and has restricted foreign automakers from digital mapping within its borders impacting many of our customers\u2019 ability to manufacture self-driving vehicles within China. Many of our customers are not domestic Chinese companies. If our non-Chinese customers are prevented or deterred from doing business in China, it could impair our position in the Chinese market. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market, the pace of growth slows or vehicle sales in China decrease, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Execution of our Business\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGiven the complexity of new product launches implementing innovative technologies, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. There is a risk that we will not be able to effectively coordinate the activities of our numerous suppliers, or install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new programs in time for the start of production, or transition our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production for such without adversely affecting production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, there is a risk that our customers will not execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs. New product launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by our customers. Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to request that our customers cover or share in these costs due to the complexities and changes requested by the customers, this could impact our relationships with our customers and the development of these programs. These negotiations can take considerable time and effort and risk deterioration of our relationships with our customers, and there can be no assurances that any specific negotiations will result in amendments that are beneficial to us on a timely basis.\nWe have a significant number of new product launches in the next 18 months. As the start of production grows closer for these programs and products, the potential risk related to timeliness and potential costs for failure to deliver timely may increase depending on the program or product as there is less time to implement any necessary changes to these programs even if they are requested by our customers. We may also have contractual liabilities for any such delays. Additionally, any such delays may impact our relationship with our customers and could impact potential future business opportunities. These issues may also be exacerbated due to deteriorating business conditions or declines in LVP. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in our supply or delivery chain, or those of our customers, could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe, as with other component manufactures in the automotive industry, ship our products to customer vehicle assembly facilities throughout the world on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis to allow our customers to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers (external suppliers as well as our own production sites) use a similar method in providing raw materials and components to us. This \u201cjust-in-time\u201d method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and vulnerable to disruptions.\nDisruptions in our supply chain such as large recalls or field actions impacting suppliers, facility closures, strikes, electrical outages, critical health and safety and other working conditions issues, pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, natural disasters or other logistical or mechanical failures, could inhibit our ability to timely deliver on orders. We may also experience disruptions if there are delays in customs processing, including if we are unable to obtain government authorization to export or import certain materials.\nIn addition, financial pressure and/or instability resulting from a prolonged downturn in or uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions, or any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP, may affect our suppliers\u2019 agility and willingness and/or ability to accommodate our commercial demands, including with respect to cost and timing. For example, during 2020, however, we experienced dramatic declines in LVP during the first half, and a significant rebound of demand in the second half. This has impacted multiple industries and created serious supply chain challenges semiconductors. We expect the semiconductor supply constraint to affect the global LVP during at least the first half of 2021, as customers halt production. This may also disproportionately affect the active safety content in vehicles as our products are often \"optional\" and not standard equipment on vehicles.\nWhen we fail to timely deliver or cause a disruption in our customers\u2019 production, we risk damaging our customer relationship, and may lose the business or have to absorb our own costs for identifying and resolving the ultimate problem as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement components or products. Generally, we must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight, and may be financially responsible for damages to the customer caused by such delays. During the second half of 2020, for example, all modes of freight have been under increased pressure due to COVID-19 and increased customer demand, and we have incurred significant premium freight costs to ensure timely delivery to our customers.\nSimilar widespread disruptions in our OEM customers\u2019 supply chains may also cause a halt or delay in production that could adversely affect our business. In particular, if the COVID-19 pandemic causes further prolonged period of travel, commercial\nand other similar restrictions, we and our OEM customers could experience more supply chain and production disruptions. The extent to which COIVD-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with many of our third-party suppliers and make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis. Our standard terms and conditions of purchase require a commitment from our suppliers to produce raw materials or components at the last piece part price accepted by the parties for at least five years following the end of a production contract, and service parts for 15 years after fulfillment of a purchase order. However, not all suppliers accept these terms and, even if accepted, we cannot be assured they will honor their contractual commitments. Autonomous driving solutions are rapidly developing and increasingly complex and require the use of advanced components that may be single-sourced or not easily replaced if the technology or the vendor does not perform as expected or agree to supply on a continuing basis. We expect that it would take approximately 12 to 18 months to transition from a current supplier to new providers for our more advanced components. Such a transition would also likely require a qualification process by our customers.\nWe may choose to pursue arrangements with suppliers that include commitments to purchase specified quantities over extended periods or nonrefundable deposits or loans in exchange for capacity commitments. If we do so, we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, and not be on terms favorable to us. To date, we have not entered into such arrangements with our suppliers.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our customers\u2019 facilities or at our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage or disruption at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products, or a work stoppage at another supplier could interrupt production at one of our customers\u2019 facilities, which would have the same effect. The risk of work stoppage has dramatically increased over the last year as a result of COVID-19. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities or our customers\u2019 facilities could cause shut-downs of production facilities supplying these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins.\nOur business uses a broad range of raw materials and components in the manufacture of our products, many of which are generally available from a number of qualified suppliers. Our industry may be affected from time to time by limited supplies or price fluctuations of certain key components and materials. Price fluctuations may intensify or occur with greater frequency as demand for our principal raw materials and components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets. Commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers may not offset the adverse impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs. Even where we are able to pass price increases along to our customer, there may be a lapse of time before we are able to do so such that we must absorb the cost increase. Some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the volatility in commodity costs, which could cause them to experience supply disruptions resulting in delivery or production delays by our suppliers. Risks associated with the cost and availability of raw materials and components could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe SEC requires companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals and their derivatives that are, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries to diligence and report the source of such materials. There are significant consequences associated with complying with these requirements, including diligence efforts to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products, changes to our processes or supplies as a result of such diligence and our ability to source \u201cconflict free\u201d materials. Accordingly, these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us or our customers.\nWe face risks related to product liability claims, warranty claims and recalls in the event that any of our products actually or allegedly are defective, fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our products after they are released to the market. Additionally, increasing regulation, including reporting requirements, regarding potentially defective products, particularly in the U.S., may increase the possibility that we become involved in additional product liability or recall investigations or claims. There is a risk that our product liability and product recall\ninsurance will not provide adequate coverage against potential claims, such insurance will not be available in the appropriate markets or that we will not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future. There is also a risk that Autoliv or one of our customers or suppliers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us for product liability, warranty or recall claims although they are contractually obligated to do so or we may be required to indemnify Autoliv or such customer for such claims, which may significantly increase our exposure and potential loss with respect to any such claims.\nThere is a risk that our current and future investments in our engineering, design, and quality infrastructure will be insufficient to prevent our products from suffering from defects or other deficiencies and that we will experience material warranty claims and product recalls. This is especially relevant in the dynamic active safety market, which is characterized by accelerated development cycles, fluctuating performance requirements and identification of potential failure modes as well as the the need to integrate products into advanced vehicle environments In the future, we could experience additional material warranty or product liability losses and incur significant costs to process and defend these claims.\nWe may be involved from time to time in legal proceedings and our business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of future legal proceedings.\nWe may be from time to time involved in litigation, regulatory proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that may be significant. These matters may include, without limitation, disputes with our suppliers and customers, intellectual property claims, stockholder litigation, government investigations, class action lawsuits, personal injury claims, environmental issues, customs and value added tax (VAT) disputes and employment and tax issues. In such matters, government agencies or private parties may seek to recover from us very large, indeterminate amounts in penalties or monetary damages (including, in some cases, treble or punitive damages) or seek to limit our operations in some way. There is a risk that claims may be asserted against us and their magnitude may remain unknown for long periods of time. These types of lawsuits could require significant management time and attention, and a substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial expenses to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships, business prospects, reputation, results of operation, cash flows and financial condition. There is a risk that such proceedings and claims will have a material adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position or that our established reserves or our available insurance will not be adequate to mitigate such impact.\nOur ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain high-performing executive officers and other key personnel.\nWe compete in a market that involves rapidly changing technological and other developments, which requires us to attract and employ a workforce with broad expertise and intellectual capital. Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies effectively depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract, develop and retain other qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other employees with software and technical expertise. The loss of the services of any of our senior executives or other key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Strategic Acquisitions and Collaborations\nWe face risks in connection with identifying and successfully completing strategic acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies and/or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners.\nOur business\u2019s growth has historically been enhanced through strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, joint development and collaborations. We may continue to identify and engage in strategic opportunities in the future. However, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or collaboration opportunities or complete transactions on acceptable terms, integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets. Our failure to identify and execute suitable strategic opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business.\nStrategic acquisition opportunities involve numerous additional risks to us and our investors, including risks related to retaining acquired management and employees, difficulties in integrating the acquired technology, products, operations and personnel with our existing business, and assumption of contingent liabilities. Consequently, there is a risk that acquisitions may not result in revenue growth, operational synergies or service or technology enhancements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic collaboration opportunities are generally governed by a collaboration agreement that defines certain ways of operation. Our collaborations are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting\nthe design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Such activities entail a high degree of risk and often require significant capital investments. We may underestimate the costs and/or overestimate the benefits, including technology, product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities, that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits, or may do so later than expected. The market and customer demand for products and technologies provided by our collaborations may also shift. For example, over the last two years we saw a shift in our customer\u2019s focus to products and systems supporting \u201cLevel 2 plus driver assistance\u201d technologies over systems supporting fully autonomous driving as it appears that fully autonomous vehicles will come to market in significant numbers later than previously expected. This required us to shift some of our strategic focus on the near-term customer demands for collaborative driving solutions.\nFurthermore, our collaboration partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other contractual obligations, and we may in some cases and/or for some time choose to fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of collaboration, or we may choose to dissolve and terminate the relationship.\nIn addition, our collaboration partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the collaboration. Our products and technologies may from time to time overlap with certain aspects of the technologies developed with one of our collaboration partners, which may cause the parties to consider the impact on the contractual relationship. Depending on our level of control over the governance and/or operations of the collaboration, we may be unable to implement actions that we believe are favorable if the collaboration partner does not agree. Disagreements with our collaboration partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our relationship. We may have difficulty resolving disputes with or claims against our partners, which could lead to us bearing liability for claims that we are not responsible for and may have a material adverse impact on the relationship. We may not have access to these technologies or suitable replacements without these collaborations. Our collaboration partners may also choose to develop competing products. We may also depend on our collaboration partners for a go to market strategy for some of our products. If one or more of our collaboration partners are not successful in the go to market strategy or experience operating difficulties or economic uncertainties, the commercial success of and our access to these technologies may be jeopardized and our revenue or product development may be negatively impacted. The above risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Capital Structure\nWe may not have sufficient resources to fund our operating costs or all of our future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions or joint ventures.\nAlthough we expect our current cash balance, combined with our future cash flows, will address our capital needs through 2022, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our operating environment is increasingly challenging, and our business and strategic plans may consume resources faster than we presently anticipate. Specifically, the lower than expected LVP in 2020 and continued uncertainty with respect to LVP levels for the next several years, along with the demand for increased R&D investment to support our order intake, the successful execution of challenging customer projects, and the continued development of our product portfolio, could require more funds than we currently have and potentially result in a future need to raise additional capital. In order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products. Our products may require significant resources to develop both hardware and software solutions. Challenges of integrating new functionality into vehicles and the evolution of our customers\u2019 performance requirements during development may also increase R&D costs. Customer demands for changes to our products to meet such performance requirements are difficult to predict both in terms of timing and cost. Since our revenue is largely based on sales over time, new customer demands can delay payment for our products which can make it difficult for us to fund these critical up-front investments. We may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions or joint ventures, and we may have to pass on valuable long-term opportunities that arise. An inability to fund our future R&D, capital expenditures and product development needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could limit our business plan or adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\nWe may find it necessary to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. Our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors, such as investor perceptions of us, our business and the industries in which we operate, general economic conditions, and the state of the financial markets. Failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us, and we may be forced to consider alternative transactions (including the sale of non-core/ non-active safety assets on terms our existing security holders perceive as unattractive) in order to fund our operations, repay debt or make new investments, or we may be unable to do so.\nEven if we are successful in raising any required funds through additional financings, this may adversely impact our existing security holders. For example, if we raise funds by issuing additional securities, the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to debt covenants, which could place limitations on our operations. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to raise required capital on a timely basis, we may be forced to adjust our strategic and business plans to prioritize more essential funding needs. This could result in delaying certain R&D initiatives, which could impact our ability to develop innovative products and technologies. If capital is not available, or is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of market opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to market changes or competitive pressures could be limited.\nOur indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have outstanding debt of $181 million. We may incur additional debt for a variety of reasons. Although our significant debt agreements do not have any financial covenants, our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, (i) a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of any interest or could be used for amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness; (ii) increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; (iii) depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and (iv) potential future tightening of the availability of capital both from financial institutions and the debt markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to access additional capital.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations and Taxes\nOur business may be adversely affected if our policies and procedures do not adequately protect our employees or others or otherwise meet the requirements of applicable laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the requirements of environmental, occupational health and safety, financial and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. Environmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing facilities entails health and safety and environmental risks, and our development processes includes vehicle testing and data collection that could expose employees to risks inherent in driving on public roads and test tracks. Although we employ safety procedures in the design and operation of our facilities and development programs, there is a risk that an accident or injury could occur. Any accident or injury could result in litigation, manufacturing and/or development delays, property loss and/or and harm to our reputation, which could negatively affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, there is a risk that we will incur material costs or liabilities, including fines and/or penalties, if regulators determine that proper controls were not in place.\nWe are also subject to local regulations and declarations related to public health issues, including travel bans, quarantines and mandated facility closures implemented in response to local, national or international epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19). Any unanticipated limitations on our ability to operate or our employees or contractors\u2019 ability to travel or work could inhibit our ability to maintain customer supply, either directly or through impact on our suppliers.\nDue to our global operations, we are also subject to many laws governing our activities in other countries (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-bribery regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we do business, and the U.S. Export Administration Act), which prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where and how we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to governmental authorities.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. Although we are currently under audit in a jurisdiction, we are indemnified by Autoliv for any tax settlements for tax periods prior to April 1, 2018. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review for tax periods after April 1, 2018 could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. There is a risk that our established reserves, which are based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, may prove to be insufficient. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated (or by the incurrence of losses) in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution under the 2018 Spin-Off from Autoliv.\nAutoliv received an opinion from its outside tax counsel to the effect that the distribution of our common stock, together with certain related transactions, should qualify as a transaction that is tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Autoliv and the Company, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Autoliv and the Company. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Autoliv or the Company breach any of their respective covenants in the Spin-Off documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is determined to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, Autoliv would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, Autoliv stockholders who received our common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. In addition, if the Spin-Off is not tax-free, Veoneer would be responsible for tax liabilities as allocated by the Tax Matters Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by COVID-19.\nThe impact of COVID-19, including widespread illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, restrictions on business and individual activities and changes in consumer behavior, has created significant volatility in the global economy led to a steep drop in economic activity during 2020. This has significantly disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the automotive industry, LVP and automotive sales in markets around the world. Such disruptions include the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of automobile manufacturers and suppliers. Global LVP decreased significantly and some vehicle manufacturers completely ceased manufacturing operations in some countries and regions, including the United States and Europe during 2020. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales to our customers. If the global economic effects caused by the pandemic continue or increase, overall customer demand may continue to decline which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if a significant portion of our workforce, our suppliers\u2019 workforce, or our\ncustomers\u2019 workforce are affected by COVID-19 either directly or due to government closures or otherwise, associated work stoppages or facility closures would halt or delay production.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the outbreak, the availability of effective vaccines, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations, and the demand for our products can resume and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Accordingly, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time.\nIn addition to the risks specifically described above, the impact of COVID-19 is likely to implicate and exacerbate other risks disclosed in this Item 1, including our program launches, demand or market acceptance for our products, disruptions in our supply or delivery chain, shifting customer preferences, our employees and cyber-security threats.\nImpairment charges relating to our assets, goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nImpairment of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance and especially the cash flow performance of these goodwill assets, adverse market conditions (including a resulting decline in our market capitalization from such adverse market conditions or deteriorating performance) and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations. If there are changes in these circumstances or the other variables associated with the estimates, judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of goodwill, when assessing the valuation of our goodwill items, we may determine that it is appropriate to write down a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets and record related non-cash impairment charges. In the event that we determine that we are required to write down a portion of our goodwill items and other intangible assets and thereby record related non-cash impairment charges, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance and especially the cash flow performance of these goodwill assets, adverse market conditions (including a resulting decline in our market capitalization from such adverse market conditions or deteriorating performance) and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations. If there are changes in these circumstances or the other variables associated with the estimates, judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of goodwill, when assessing the valuation of our goodwill items, we may determine that it is appropriate to write down a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets and record related non-cash impairment charges. In the event that we determine that we are required to write down a portion of our goodwill items and other intangible assets and thereby record related non-cash impairment charges, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to our defined benefit pension plans and employee benefit plans, including the need for additional funding as well as higher costs and liabilities.\nOur defined benefit pension plans or employee benefit plans may require additional funding or give rise to higher related costs and liabilities which, in some circumstances, could reach material amounts and negatively affect our results of operations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact these plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, investment losses on plan assets and reductions in discount rates may increase our funding obligations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets will be sufficient to meet future funding requirements. If these or other risks were to occur, our required contributions to the plans and the costs and net liabilities associated with the plans could increase substantially and have a material effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our products or business operations, result in damages or loss of confidence in our products, or the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks and systems, our global data centers and services provided over the internet to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes or activities across our facilities worldwide. The secure operation of our IT networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to cyber-attacks. To date we have seen no material impact on our business from these attacks or events. Although we seek to deploy comprehensive security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, there has been an increased level of activity, and an associated level of sophistication, in cyber-attacks against large multinational companies. The ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.\nOur security measures may be breached due to human error or malfeasance, system malfunctions or attacks from uncoordinated individuals or sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers.\nDisruptions and attacks on our IT systems or the systems of third parties storing our data could result in the misappropriation, loss or corruption of our critical data and confidential or proprietary information, personal information of our employees, and the leakage of our or our customers\u2019 confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, diversion of the attention of management away from the operation of our business and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide or maintain some of our IT systems, data centers and related services and do not exercise direct control over these systems. There is a risk that security measures implemented at our own and at third party locations may not be sufficient and that our IT systems, data centers and cloud services are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyberattacks or failures in third party-provided services. While we obtain assurances that any third parties we provide data to will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by us or by third parties may be compromised and expose us to liability for such breach.\nCyberattacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated and globally widespread and could target software embedded in our products. Embedded software code could be compromised during software development or manufacturing processes or within the car itself. Cyberattacks on our products within the car can lead to malfunction or complete damage of the products, which could result into loss of control of the car and its safety features and could cause injuries and significant damage to our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers. Additionally, to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a misappropriation, loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or our customer\u2019s information, it could also cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or repair damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Any future significant cybersecurity compromise or breach of our products, our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Investing in Our Common Stock and SDRs\nOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things:\n\u2022although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, our certificate of incorporation allows us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or\n\u2022otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022we have a classified board of directors, and any director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u2022our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and our stockholders may only amend our bylaws by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation and bylaws permits only our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not permit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our stockholders, directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, (iv) the certificate of incorporation or amended and bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim government by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provision in our restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. This provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers or employees by limiting our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022a shift in our investor base;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of comparable companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating performance and stock price of comparable companies;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022a decline in the automotive market; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other external factors.\nFuture issuances of common stock by us may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we adopted an equity incentive plan in which our employees, non-employee directors and other service providers may participate, under which an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for future issuance, plus a number of shares to satisfy equity-based awards that were issued to holders of certain equity awards outstanding under Autoliv\u2019s Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan at the time of the Spin-Off. We filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or\nexchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement are available for sale in the open market.\nYour ownership in our common stock may be diluted by additional equity issuances.\nYour percentage ownership in our common stock could be diluted in the future as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred shares having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and certain factors could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the absolute and sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future. We have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.\nVeoneer SDR holders do not have the same rights as our stockholders.\nA Veoneer SDR holder does not have equivalent rights as our holders of common stock, whose rights are governed by U.S. federal law and the Delaware General Corporation Law. The rights of Veoneer SDR holders are set forth and described in to the General Terms and Conditions for Swedish Depository Receipts in Veoneer (the \u201cGeneral Terms and Conditions\u201d). Although the General Terms and Conditions generally allow Veoneer SDR holders to vote in general meetings of stockholders or to be entitled to dividends as if they held our shares of common stock directly, the rights of Veoneer SDR holders differ in some instances from the rights of Veoneer stockholders. In particular, Veoneer SDR holders do not have the ability to nominate directors for election or bring proposals before our annual meeting to the extent provided for in our governing documents or by applicable U.S. state or federal law. Additionally, Veoneer SDR holders may not be able to enforce their rights under the General Terms and Conditions in relation to their SDRs in the same manner as one of our stockholders could with respect to our shares of common stock under applicable U.S. law.\nThe trading market for Veoneer SDRs may be limited in the future.\nThere is a risk that a trading market for Veoneer SDRs will not develop or be sustained in the future. Veoneer SDRs traded in Stockholm are not equivalent to a Swedish security being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm. Specifically, Veoneer SDRs represent shares of a U.S. company and are not themselves shares of stock. The lack of an active trading market may make it more difficult for you to sell your Veoneer SDRs and could lead to the price of Veoneer SDRs being depressed or more volatile.", "PERMNO": 17859, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "VNE"}
