{"cik": "30697", "company": "Wendy's Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2015, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nOur success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.\nThere have been a number of changes in our senior management team beginning in 2011, including the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2011. We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team. The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.\nCompetition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy\u2019s restaurants, could hurt our brand.\nThe market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy\u2019s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy\u2019s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises. Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends. Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options. Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.\nMoreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can. Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.\nThe quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nIf company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.\nDisruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending. If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees. There can be no assurance that government responses\nto the disruptions will restore consumer confidence. Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nChanges in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. The Company experienced significant increases in certain commodity costs in 2014, and the Company expects ongoing commodity cost pressures in 2015. Ongoing commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results. In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy. Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs. Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy\u2019s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWendy\u2019s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.\nFood safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy\u2019s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.\nFood safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats. As a result, Wendy\u2019s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy\u2019s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.\nIn addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy\u2019s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy\u2019s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate. Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy\u2019s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy\u2019s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.\nConsumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.\nConsumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.\nIncreased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.\nEvents reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy\u2019s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy\u2019s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate. This could reduce demand for Wendy\u2019s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.\nGrowth of our restaurant business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur restaurant business derives earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened. Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings. These factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new franchisees;\n\u2022\nthe availability of site locations for new restaurants;\n\u2022\nthe ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;\n\u2022\nthe ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;\n\u2022\nthe ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them. Wendy\u2019s also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand\u2019s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nOur success depends on franchisees\u2019 participation in brand strategies.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees are an integral part of our business. Wendy\u2019s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations.\nThroughout 2015, the Company expects Wendy\u2019s and its franchisees to reimage approximately 450 existing company-owned and franchised restaurants and open approximately 80 new company-owned and franchised restaurants under its Image Activation program, with plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2016 and beyond.\nWendy\u2019s has incentive programs for franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels during 2015, 2016 and 2017. The incentive programs provide reductions in royalty payments for one year or two years after the completion of construction depending upon the type of remodel. Wendy\u2019s also had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees\u2019 participation in Wendy\u2019s Image Activation program throughout 2014 and 2013. These incentives will result in a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees during the periods covered.\nIn addition to the Image Activation incentive programs described above, Wendy\u2019s executed an agreement to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program. Under the program, the lender is providing loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under the Image Activation program. To support the program, Wendy\u2019s has provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit.\nThe Company\u2019s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned restaurants or improve results of operations. There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company\u2019s results of operations will improve.\nFurther, it is possible that Wendy\u2019s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program. These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future. If Wendy\u2019s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy\u2019s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.\nIn addition, most of the Wendy\u2019s system consists of franchised restaurants. Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program. Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy\u2019s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it continues to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees. If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.\nAs of December 28, 2014, approximately 85% of the Wendy\u2019s system were franchise restaurants. We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline. In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase. When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases. During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms. Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease. Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.\nThe system optimization initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn August 2014, the Company announced a plan to sell all of its company-owned restaurants in Canada to franchisees as part of its ongoing system optimization initiative, which it now anticipates completing by the end of the second quarter of 2015. In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 500 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing Company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the middle of 2016, as part of its ongoing system optimization initiative. There are a number of risks associated with the system optimization initiative, including the difficulty in predicting the ultimate costs associated with the sale of restaurants, employee termination costs, the timing of payments made and received, the results of negotiations with landlords, the impact of the sale of restaurants on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of restaurants, and the future impact to the Company\u2019s earnings, restaurant operating margin, cash flow and depreciation. If Wendy\u2019s is unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nFurther, Wendy\u2019s generally retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate when it sells restaurants under the system optimization initiative and leases or subleases the real estate to franchisees. This increases the risks described above under the heading \u201cOur financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.\u201d\nWendy\u2019s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWendy\u2019s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy\u2019s restaurants to franchisees. Wendy\u2019s intends to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of company-owned restaurants to existing and new franchisees. The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand\u2019s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable. In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized. Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities arising out of sellers\u2019 prior operations of acquired restaurants; and\n\u2022\nincurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.\nIn addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand\u2019s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources. If Wendy\u2019s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nCurrent restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.\nThe success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected.\nWendy\u2019s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.\nAs of December 28, 2014, Wendy\u2019s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 957 Wendy\u2019s restaurants. Wendy\u2019s also owned 230 and leased 488 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 28, 2014. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.\nWendy\u2019s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties. We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities. In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims. See \u201cItem 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nWendy\u2019s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof. Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally\ncannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.\nDue to the concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.\nAs of December 28, 2014, we and our franchisees operated Wendy\u2019s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 28 foreign countries and territories. As of December 28, 2014 and as detailed in \u201cItem 2. Properties,\u201d the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations. It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.\nOur operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.\nWeather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy\u2019s restaurant sales. Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area. Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses. For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy\u2019s performance or how it may perform in the future.\nWendy\u2019s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants. Wendy\u2019s devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and government-mandated health care benefits), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition, Wendy\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff. If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company, through a subsidiary, has withdrawn from a multiemployer pension plan. Wendy\u2019s assumed an estimated withdrawal liability in the fourth quarter of 2013, but the final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions with the pension fund administrator.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2013, the unionized employees at The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc. (the \u201cBakery Company\u201d), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy\u2019s, now known as The New Bakery Company, LLC, were covered by the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the \u201cUnion Pension Fund\u201d), a multiemployer pension plan. The Bakery Company remitted contributions based on hours worked by covered, unionized employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that expired on March 31, 2013 and the Rehabilitation Plan adopted by the Union Pension Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 due to the underfunded status of the plan.\nIn December of 2013, the Bakery Company terminated its participation in the Union Pension Fund and formally notified the plan\u2019s trustees of its withdrawal from the plan. The Union Pension Fund administrator has acknowledged the withdrawal, which required Wendy\u2019s to assume an estimated withdrawal liability of $13.5 million based on the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, and which was included in \u201cCost of sales\u201d during the fourth quarter of 2013. As a result, Wendy\u2019s made payments to the Union Pension Fund totaling $0.7 million during 2014 which were recorded as a reduction to the withdrawal liability. The Bakers Local No. 57, Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union of America, AFL-CIO (the \u201cUnion\u201d) filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cNLRB\u201d) related to the Bakery Company\u2019s withdrawal from the Union Pension Fund. On July 22, 2014, The New Bakery of Zanesville, LLC (\u201cZanesville\u201d), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy\u2019s, and the Union entered into a settlement agreement with the NLRB. The terms of the settlement include an agreement by Zanesville and the Union to recommence negotiations. Zanesville and the Union have recommenced negotiations. Any final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions between Zanesville and the Union Pension Fund administrator at the conclusion of the negotiations with the Union.\nThe unionized employees became eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan as of December 5, 2013.\nComplaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy\u2019s brand.\nWendy\u2019s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations and hurt our performance. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.\nAdditionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy\u2019s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy\u2019s brand and hurt our business.\nOur intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.\nWe franchise our brand to various franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy\u2019s restaurant system.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.\nWe currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and\nmanagement estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.\nEach Wendy\u2019s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations. There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future. In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nFederal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.\nChanges in government-mandated health care benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) are also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees. Our compliance with the PPACA may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices. Wendy\u2019s experienced a modest enrollment in its health plans with newly eligible employees. Because participation in the health plans by newly full-time employees was modest, the cost increases did not result in modifications to our business practices. However, future cost increases may be material and any future modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.\nChanges in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.\nWendy\u2019s does not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for its restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.\nAlthough Wendy\u2019s ensures that all suppliers to the Wendy\u2019s system meet quality control standards, Wendy\u2019s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy\u2019s franchisees, QSCC. QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies. Wendy\u2019s is entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy\u2019s quality control standards. If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy\u2019s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy\u2019s franchisees could be hurt.\nOur international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.\nIn addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy\u2019s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners. Although we\nbelieve we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.\nTo the extent we invest in international company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business. Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nWe are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business. A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations. Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. A significant security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations and third-party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nWe collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees. Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by third-party contracts. If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.\nWe have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:\n\u2022\nsignificant adverse changes in the business climate;\n\u2022\ncurrent period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;\n\u2022\na current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and\n\u2022\na significant drop in our stock price.\nBased upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred. Further, as a result of the system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, and may incur further losses as the Company continues to sell restaurants under the system optimization initiative.\nWe enter into swaps and other derivative contracts, which expose us to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.\nWe have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWendy\u2019s and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a credit agreement.\nOn May 16, 2013, Wendy\u2019s amended and restated its credit agreement, dated May 15, 2012 (the \u201cRestated Credit Agreement\u201d). The Restated Credit Agreement is comprised of a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility (\u201cTerm A Loans\u201d), a partial refinancing of our existing term loan resulting in a $769.4 million senior secured term loan facility (\u201cTerm B Loans\u201d) and a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The Restated Credit Agreement also contains provisions for an uncommitted increase of up to $275.0 million principal amount of the Term B Loans subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The revolving credit facility includes a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit and allows for liens in the form of cash collateralized letters of credit up to an additional $40.0 million. During 2013, Wendy\u2019s transitioned the security for all of its outstanding letters of credit from the revolving credit facility to cash collateral. Therefore, as of December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nOn September 24, 2013, Wendy\u2019s entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to its Restated Credit Agreement to borrow an aggregate principal amount up to $225.0 million of additional Term A Loans (\u201cIncremental Term Loans\u201d). On October 24, 2013, Wendy\u2019s borrowed $225.0 million of Incremental Term Loans under the Amendment.\nThe obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets and stock of Wendy\u2019s and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries) and 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The affirmative and negative covenants in the Restated Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business. The financial covenants contained in the Restated Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, and (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. For purposes of these covenants, \u201cconsolidated\u201d means the combined results of Wendy\u2019s and its subsidiaries (other than unrestricted subsidiaries). The covenants generally do not restrict The Wendy\u2019s Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy\u2019s. If Wendy\u2019s and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Restated Credit Agreement, then Wendy\u2019s would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to The Wendy\u2019s Company, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness. See Note 10 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Restated Credit Agreement.\nWendy\u2019s has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.\nWendy\u2019s has a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of December 28, 2014, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding debt.\nThis level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries\u2019 debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nIn addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. Wendy\u2019s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing, and two guarantees to lenders for franchisees, in connection with the refinancing of a franchisee\u2019s debt and the sale of restaurants to a franchisee. Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified. Wendy\u2019s has also provided an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit to a lender to support a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program. These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.\nThe ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.\nWe have announced that we intend to incur substantially more debt. This would exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe have announced that we intend to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify.\nTo service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy\u2019s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.\nThe ability of Wendy\u2019s to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Restated Credit Agreement and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability of Wendy\u2019s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the Restated Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, Wendy\u2019s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There is no assurance that the Wendy\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or The Wendy\u2019s Company\u2019s dividend and other liquidity needs.\nThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nBecause the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries. The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Restated Credit Agreement, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.\nA substantial amount of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.\nNelson Peltz, the Company\u2019s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company\u2019s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company\u2019s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 24% of its total voting power as of February 25, 2015. Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.\nOn December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201cTrian Agreement\u201d) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the \u201cSection 203 Approval\u201d).\nThe Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the agreement) terminated pursuant to the termination provisions of the Trian Agreement after funds affiliated with the Covered Persons sold 16.2 million shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on January 15, 2014, thereby decreasing the Covered Persons\u2019 beneficial ownership to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company as of that date. The Covered Persons sold an additional 2.0 million shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on February 25, 2014. The terminated provisions of the Trian Agreement included provisions restricting the Covered Persons in the following areas: (i) beneficial ownership of Company voting securities; (ii) solicitation of proxies or submission of a proposal for the vote of stockholders under certain circumstances; (iii) certain affiliate transactions with the Company; and (iv) voting of certain Company voting securities.\nThis concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.\nCertain provisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock. The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable. Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee. This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates.", "PERMNO": 89818, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "WEN"}
