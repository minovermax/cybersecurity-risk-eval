{"cik": "1002037", "company": "LEARNING TREE INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties, keeping in mind that they are not the only ones that affect us. Additional risks that we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us.\nGoing Concern; Limited Liquidity and Negative Cash Flows\nWe have had negative cash flows from operations, have not achieved a net profit on an annual basis for the past three years and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are not able to generate positive cash flow, our business operations may not be able to continue.\nOver the past three years we have experienced net losses and declining revenues. In fiscal year 2018, our worldwide revenues from operations decreased 9.0% to $64.3 million from $70.7 million in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2017, our worldwide revenues from operations decreased 13.4% to $70.7 million from $81.6 million in fiscal year 2016. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, our registered independent public accounting firm issued a report on our audited financial statements that included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. We have initiated several business strategies and initiatives to stabilize and increase revenue and implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program that reduced both cost of revenues and operating expenses and secured a $5.0 million Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with the Kevin Ross Gruneich Legacy Trust as lender (the \u201cTrust\u201d), which also is our largest stockholder. Despite these actions however, we may be unsuccessful in generating sufficient cash flow, and improving our profitability for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. For fiscal year 2018, the report the Company received from its independent registered public accounting firm on its consolidated financial statements as of September 28, 2018 again contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and may realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern and do not reflect any adjustment that might result if we were not able to continue operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 that accompany this Form 10-K were prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustment or impact that might result if we were not unable to continue ongoing operations.\nOur Credit Agreement contains covenants, representations and warranties that the Company is required to comply with in order to receive future advances or avoid triggering an event of default.\nOur Credit Agreement includes covenants, representations and warranties that the Company must comply with during the term of the Credit Agreement, as well as at the time of an advance under the Credit Agreement. The terms of the Credit Agreement also contains an acceleration clause that can be triggered if the Trust, as the lender, determines an Event of Default has occurred that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and continuance thereof for ten (10) calendar days, which in turn would permit the Trust to accelerate repayment of outstanding obligations. In addition, there are circumstances where an event of default under the Credit Agreement would occur if the Company is required to pay a final judgment or order against the Company above certain levels not covered by insurance, which final judgment or order would not be in the control of the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement allows the Company to make quarterly borrowings until the aggregate amount of the credit has been drawn, but if we are not able to make the representations and warranties under the Credit Agreement on such quarterly borrowing date, then the Company would not be able to borrow additional funds at that time. If the Company does not remain in compliance with certain covenants or obligations under the Credit Agreement, then it may result in an inability to borrow additional funds and/or constitute an event of default, in which case, could result in amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. If the Company is not able to receive advances or if an event of default were to occur resulting in payment acceleration, then such events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and the business of the Company. Further, there is no assurance that the Company will have the ability to fully repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default, or that the Company would be able to refinance or restructure payments on those borrowings.\nThe Company relies on the Credit Agreement as a significant source of capital and liquidity currently available to the Company. As of October 1, 2018, the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Agreement is $3.0 million, and the Company has the ability to borrow an additional $2.0 million. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company be in compliance with certain covenants as a condition to receiving additional advances under the Credit Agreement, including satisfying a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a required level of EBITDA, as well as representations, warranties and covenants. Current projections for fiscal year 2019 indicate that the Company will not meet the EBITDA requirement at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. If the Company is not able to satisfy the conditions to borrowing under the Credit Agreement, we will not be able to draw on the Credit Agreement at such time, and the Company\u2019s options for capital and/or liquidity at such time may be limited to its cash and cash equivalents or its existing secured line of credit with Action Capital, which has higher borrowing costs and is subject to the prior approval of Action Capital and the availability of accounts receivable acceptable to Action Capital.\nOur Financing Agreement requires there to be acceptable Company accounts receivable in order to receive advances from our lender, which amounts may not be available in the amounts or at the times that we may need them.\nWe entered into a Financing and Security Agreement dated January 12, 2017 (\u201cFinancing Agreement\u201d) with Action Capital Corporation (\u201cAction Capital\u201d), which provides us with potential access to borrow up to $3.0 million. Amounts advanced to us under this Financing Agreement are subject to the prior approval of Action Capital and the availability of accounts receivable acceptable to Action Capital. Accordingly, there is no assurance that advances will be made to us in the amounts and at the times when they are requested by us, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and ability to operate the business. In addition, we may not have the requisite amount of acceptable accounts receivable in order to borrow up to the maximum principal amount under the Financing Agreement.\nThe loss of available credit under the Credit Agreement and the Financing Agreement or termination of either or both could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to operate our business.\nAlthough we were in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and the Financing Agreement as of the end of fiscal year 2018, current projections for fiscal year 2019 indicate that the Company will not meet the minimum EBITDA requirement under the Credit Agreement at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. If this or other events were to occur which result in either a termination of the Credit Agreement and/or the Financing Agreement, or the loss of all or a substantial portion of our available credit under the Credit Agreement and/or the Financing Agreement, or if we are otherwise prevented from accessing such funds, and we did not have an alternative line of credit or other additional sources of capital available, then we would need to rely upon our cash and cash equivalents for our working capital needs, which may not be sufficient. In addition, because the Financing Agreement has no set term and may be terminated by either party at any time, we cannot be certain that access to capital sourced through this lending arrangement will be available when needed. If we were unable to replace these sources of liquidity, then our ability to fund our operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot be certain that any additional financing will be available to us or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe currently have limited sources of liquidity and may need to obtain another credit facility and/or raise new capital to provide additional liquidity. If we fail to obtain additional liquidity as needed, then we will continue to rely on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs to the extent that our operating cash flows will allow and amounts available under any existing lending arrangements.\nPrior to entering into the Credit Agreement, we primarily relied upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs. Our working capital needs have exceeded, and could continue to exceed for the near future, cash flows available from operations. If we do not generate positive cash flow from operations or have access to advances under the Credit and Financing Agreements in the amounts we need or obtain access to capital from additional sources that may or may not be available to us, or even if available, may not be on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, then our cash and cash equivalents will continue to decline. Consequently, any adverse impact on our operating results would impact our cash flows from operations and our ability to continue to meet our operating cash needs which would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nDeregistration: Limited Market for Our Common Stock\nWe intend to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act, which may negatively affect the liquidity and trading prices of our common stock and will result in significantly less financial and other disclosures about the Company.\nOn December 20, 2018, we announced our intention to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act on or about December 28, 2018. Upon the filing of our Form 15, our obligation to file reports with the SEC, such as Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, will immediately cease. Our announcement to suspend our periodic reporting obligations, as well as the ultimate cessation of our periodic reporting, may materially and adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock on the OTC Markets, even though the availability of stock price quotations and limited trading may continue for a period time on the OTC Pink market after the Company suspends its SEC reporting. The market price of our stock and the availability of continued, limited trading on the OTC Markets also may be further negatively impacted if the market perceives our decision to go-dark to be the result of adverse changes in our prospects or seeking to serve insider interests. As a result, investors likely will find it more difficult to obtain quotations as to the market value of our common stock, if at all, and to dispose of their shares in desired amounts and within preferred timeframes, and the overall ability of our stockholders to sell our securities in the secondary market likely will be materially limited. Our anticipated deregistration also may make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital in the future if we desire to do so and may make our stock less attractive for use as consideration in any potential business combination transactions.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, with currently only a minimal public market for our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock currently is quoted on the OTCQX. Historically, our stock has had limited trading volume due to, among other things, our small size and minimal public float. There has been and may continue to be periods of several business days or more when trading activity in our common stock is non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on price. There has not been an active public trading market for our common stock in the past and, considering our plans to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act and cease public reporting, one is not likely to develop in the future. Accordingly, investors may be unable to sell their shares in the public market at desired prices, in desired amounts, or at all.\nPotential future Sales of Our Common Stock and Securities.\nSales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and other affiliates, or the perception that sales by those persons may occur, could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of shares of our common stock. In addition to the 13,224,349 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 14, 2018, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate 775,000 shares of common stock, with an additional 475,000 shares reserved and available for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. We cannot predict the effect that any such future sales of our common stock, or the potential for those sales, will have on our share price.\nOur common stock currently is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which may adversely impact the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. Those rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations for our stock and may find few buyers to purchase our stock and few market makers to support its price.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. These FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common.\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nWe may be unable to realize our business strategy of improving operating performance, growing our business and generating savings and improvements.\nOver the past five years the Company has been experiencing a decline in course attendance and revenue generated from our operations. As a result, we have been implementing new strategic initiatives, including those described in this Form 10-K, which include offering and expanding the services provided through Workforce Optimization Solutions, adjusting the duration of some of our courses to be more competitive, the comprehensive cost reduction program, Guaranteed to Run (\u201cGTR\u201d) courses, and pricing promotions that are designed to improve our operating performance, stabilize and increase revenue and grow our business. The failure to achieve the goals of some or all of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our business. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue, successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any initiative or that we will be able to sustain improvements made to date.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated, and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future.\nFluctuations in our historical operating results have resulted from many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the future, these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease. For example:\nTiming of Course Development, and Sales and Marketing Expenditures.\nWe try to adjust our expenditures for course development and sales and marketing to maintain our long-term profitability, including our assessment of the potential to influence future customer demand, market conditions, and other factors. This may mean accepting reduced margins in poor economic periods, as we must commit too much of our spending before our attendees enroll in our courses. If revenues fall short of our expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures quickly enough to compensate for lower than anticipated revenues. This could compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.\nMany of the new titles now being offered are not developed or taught by Learning Tree, but rather were obtained from other providers.\nReselling other providers courses limits our ability to ensure a quality customer experience. While we do review and approve partner courses before offering them to our customers, our revenues could be negatively impacted if customers are not satisfied with these courses. In addition, the margins earned on these partner courses may be lower than those of our proprietary courses.\nCourse Scheduling and Marketing Activities.\nThe timing and content of our courses and our marketing activities can affect the number of participants who attend our courses. Some of the activities that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe frequency of our course events;\n\u2022\nthe number of weeks during which our courses can be conducted in a quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing, timely delivery, frequency and size of, and the response to, our marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction of new course titles;\n\u2022\nthe average length of courses, based on the current mix of course titles, which affects the average revenue per attendee; and\n\u2022\nthe mix between course events held at customer locations and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins.\nSeasonal Factors.\nOur quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers, which are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ncyclic or one-time budgetary considerations;\n\u2022\ngovernment spending and budget cycles;\n\u2022\nfactors specific to their business or industry; and\n\u2022\nweather, holiday and vacation considerations.\nUse of Accounting Estimates.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires us to make estimates and assumptions in calculating our financial results. As one example, we currently offer our customers a multiple-course sales discount referred to as a Training Passport, which allows an individual Passport holder to attend up to a specified number of Learning Tree courses over a specified period for a fixed price. For a Training Passport, the amount of revenue we recognize for each attendance in one of our courses is based upon the selling price of the Training Passport, the list price of the course taken, the average list price of all courses taken, and our estimate of the average number of courses a Passport holder will attend. After expiration of a Training Passport, we record the difference, if any, between the revenue previously recognized and the Training Passport selling price. We base our estimate of the average number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend based on historical trends. However, these historical trends may not accurately predict the actual number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend in the future. If average Training Passport attendance rates were to increase, for example, we would have to make negative adjustments to our revenue, which could be significant. For a summary of some of our key accounting estimates, please see our \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets and changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial position.\nIn fiscal year 2012, we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the United States due to current year and projected future pre-tax book losses. We continue to maintain this valuation allowance throughout the subsequent financial years. Management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part, primarily with respect to projecting taxable income. Future taxable income can never be projected with certainty as it is dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. Substantial variances between our estimates of future taxable income and actual results, or changes in our estimate of future taxable income, could lead to changes in the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized and could therefore require corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance. Our income tax provision could be significantly impacted by estimates surrounding our uncertain tax positions, decisions on repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes to our valuation allowance in future periods. Furthermore, the new tax laws enacted in December 2017 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which brought about corporate income tax rate changes, the modification or elimination of certain tax incentives, changes to the U.S. tax regime for taxing overseas earnings (including modification to the regime for repatriating such earnings), and measures to prevent base erosion of profits in the U.S., may also impact our future effective tax rate and have a significant effect on our future operating results. As a result, we may never be able to use the full amount of our deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our financial position.\nChanging Regulation of Corporate Governance and Public Disclosure.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs incurred with ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed. If the Company deregisters its common stock under the Exchange Act, the Company will be able to materially reduce its costs of public reporting compliance under U.S. securities laws.\nIntroductions and Adoption of New Technology.\nOur customers tend to increase their training at times when new technology is being introduced. During periods when fewer new technologies are being introduced, demand for our training courses may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOther Factors.\nOther factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract customers and meet their expectations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndifferences in the timing of our spending on the marketing of our courses, as well as the timing of our spending on the development of our courses and other areas; and\n\u2022\nexcess capacity and/or unused space in our education centers and/or administrative office facilities, and our ability to sublease or find other uses for it.\nAll or any of these and similar factors could cause our operating results to differ substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nRisks Associated with Technology Changes\nIf we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nChanges in technology can affect our business in at least two principal ways. First, we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and other information technologies and develop courses that effectively train customers in the technologies they use now and will use in the future. Second, we must adapt to changes in the technologies by which we can deliver training to our customers\u2019 employees. Because of technology developments, we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to develop new course titles, buy new equipment, or invest in further course development software and processes to deliver our courses. Our liquidity and cash flow situation could negatively impact our ability to accomplish this. Further, we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technology changes for many reasons, including misjudging the impact of technology changes, as well as financial, technological or other constraints. A lack of an adequate timely response on our part to changes in information technology platforms, customer preferences or software technology could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nCompetition\nIf our customers decide that they prefer training offered by new or existing competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nThe IT and management training markets are highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry. No single competitor holds a dominant market share. We face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market. Our primary competitors include:\n\u2022\nin-house training departments within our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\ncomputer hardware and software vendors and their Authorized Training and Education Center partners;\n\u2022\nindependent education and training companies;\n\u2022\nacademic providers; and\n\u2022\nsoftware systems integrators.\nSome of our competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at lower prices. In addition, some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Additionally, hardware and software vendors, as well as software systems integrators, may bundle IT education and training with sales of their products or other services, which could allow them to offer training at lower prices than we do. Furthermore, future consolidation of IT vendors or training companies could have a material impact on our future operations.\nThe risk of outsourcing of corporate IT administration and software development overseas to countries or firms not currently served by us could have a material adverse impact on our future operations.\nAlthough instructor-led classroom training continues to dominate the worldwide IT and management training markets, technology-based education and training formats, such as Internet-based distance learning, have gained acceptance. Accordingly, our future results may also depend on the extent to which the market will continue to value instructor-led IT and management training and on our ability to develop and market instructor-led courses that compete effectively against technology-based courses offered by our competitors.\nRisks Associated with International Operations\nApproximately 40% of our annual revenue is generated by courses conducted outside the United States. Therefore, if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars, while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies. Consequently, changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and could result in exchange losses. We do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. Even if we were to use hedging techniques in the future, we might not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOur operations in the United Kingdom pose additional risks to our profitability and operating results.\nFollowing a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), the U.K. government has initiated a process to leave the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Such an exit from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the EU Single Market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations and customers. Our U.K. operations service customers in the U.K. as well as in other countries in the EU, and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit, particularly if there is a change in the U.K.\u2019s relationship to the EU Single Market. While the full scope of implementation of the referendum decision is still unclear, companies exposed to or with operations in the U.K., such as ours, may face significant regulatory changes as a result of Brexit implementation, and complying with such new regulatory mandates may prove challenging and costly. Significant portions of the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime related to intellectual property and data protection are derived from or harmonized with wider EU directives, and significant change is possible should the U.K. withdraw from the EU. Even prior to any change to the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU, the announcement of Brexit has created economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit and its consequences could adversely impact customer confidence resulting in customers reducing their spending budgets on our products and services, which would adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nChanges in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \u201cprivacy laws\u201d) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \u201cprocess\u201d) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as \u201cpersonal data\u201d) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nIn Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Directive on Data Protection (\u201c1995 Data Protection Directive\u201d), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. On December 15, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (Council) reached a political agreement on the future EU data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The GDPR will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. The GDPR became effective in May 2018. The Company believes it is in compliance with the GDPR. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions, alter the way we conduct business and/or could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOther Risks Associated with International Operations.\nAdditionally, our results of operations may be adversely affected by other international risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in translating our courses into foreign languages;\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and/or compliance with government regulation in various countries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing our foreign offices, and in training and retaining foreign instructors;\n\u2022\nadverse income tax and transfer pricing consequences; and\n\u2022\npotential costs associated with expansion into new territories or withdrawing from a territory.\nWe expect that international revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues. A lack of anticipation and response to the risks associated with international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers, our senior managers and other key personnel. The loss of these people, especially without advance notice, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. It is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including course instructors, to accommodate growth, new course titles and to replace personnel who leave. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, especially in information technology industries and/or in certain geographic areas, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions as well as our recent operating performance, we may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified instructors and employees. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to utilize knowledgeable instructors at our various locations.\nOur business is based on successfully attracting and utilizing professional instructors with the knowledge and ability to effectively deliver our course materials to participants. Because we deliver course events at multiple locations throughout the world, we rely on some of our instructors to travel to such locations to teach our courses. If we are not able to timely send our instructors to locations due to restrictive immigration laws or otherwise, then we may incur additional costs in delivering the course event or face limitations in the local and number of course events we present internationally.\nRisks Associated with Intellectual Property\nEvents outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our courses are delivered. We cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar course titles or delivery methods unencumbered by our proprietary rights. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. We may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others or have to pursue claims to protect our proprietary rights. Defending against and prosecuting these claims is costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf substantial unauthorized use of our courses occurs or if we must defend against infringement claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and confidential information. Our course development process and course titles are predominately proprietary, and we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, customer licensing agreements, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights. Our course materials generally do not include any mechanisms to prohibit or prevent unauthorized use. As a result, someone could copy or otherwise obtain and use our course materials without authorization, either for educational use or to develop competing courses. In addition, we operate in countries that do not provide protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. Finally, our intellectual property rights will not prevent competitors from independently developing similar course titles or delivery methods. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our results of operations and price of our common stock could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If such a claim succeeded, we might have to change or eliminate courses and could be required to pay damages or royalties. In addition, litigation over intellectual property rights, whether brought by us or by someone else, could be time-consuming and expensive, even if we were ultimately to succeed. Accordingly, defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Changes in patent law, foreign or domestic, may have an impact on our ability to obtain patent protections. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees or former employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nRisks Associated with Laws and Regulations\nChanges to laws and regulations can affect our operations and may limit our ability to operate in certain states and foreign jurisdictions or adversely impact our operating results.\nProviders of educational programs to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of Federal, state and international governments. Generally, we are exempt from this type of regulation because we contract with the employer of the participants in our courses, and we do not participate in any Federal, state or foreign student aid or loan programs. However, changes to state and foreign laws and regulations targeting educational providers could affect our operations in the future and could limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states. If we were found in violation of a state\u2019s or foreign jurisdiction\u2019s current or future licensing or regulatory requirements, then we could be subject to civil or criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, and we could also be barred from providing educational services in that state or foreign jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulatory decisions in many areas other than education could also adversely affect our operations. Complying with current or future legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nWe are subject to tax audits by state, Federal and foreign jurisdictions. Such audits are to be expected and may result in adjustments as a result of the accretion of tax jurisdiction interpretations and changes in operational practices. Any such audits may result in additional taxes being assessed or in the refund of taxes previously paid. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Cyber Security\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personal identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nDependence on Key Vendors\nInterruptions of services or support from our key vendors could result in an adverse impact to our operations and financial results.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nControl by Certain Stockholders\nA majority of our outstanding shares are beneficially owned by one stockholder, and the stockholder could have significant influence over our policies and affairs and will be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions.\nAs of December 14, 2018, the Trust beneficially owned 10,495,332 shares of common stock, representing beneficial ownership of approximately 64.7% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares, which includes 7,495,332 shares of common stock acquired from the Collins Parties in the Sale Transaction and 3,000,000 conversion shares in connection to the Credit Agreement. The Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Kevin Gruneich, is affiliated with the Trust. Consequently, the Trust will have the power to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of certain corporate actions and transactions requiring stockholder approval.\nOur majority stockholder has significant influence over the composition of our Board.\nOur majority stockholder, the Trust, has significant influence over the composition of the directors serving on the Board. In connection with the Trust becoming the majority stockholder of the Company, our Chairman of the Board, Mr. Gruneich, was nominated by the Trust and pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement the Trust also has the right to nominate up to three additional qualified members to the Board before January 31, 2019, subject to such nominees being qualified candidates and if two directors were to resign. To date, the Trust has utilized two of these director nomination rights with the nomination and subsequent appointments of Ms. Candee and Ms. Gardial to the Board. In addition, even without these rights in the Purchase Agreement, the Trust holds a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company and therefore has the ability to determine the outcome of elections of directors who will serve on the Board.\nA large number of shares are issuable upon conversion of the amounts borrowed pursuant to the Credit Agreement with our majority stockholder. The conversion of the amounts payable under the Credit Agreement could result in substantial dilution of your stockholdings.\nThe Credit Agreement provides the Trust, as the lender, with the right to convert, at any time, up to the full amount of the then outstanding principal that is borrowed by the Company, up to the commitment amount of $5.0 million, into shares of common stock, which conversion price is initially $1.00 per share. On June 29, 2018 and October 1, 2018, the Company received $2.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of advances under the terms of the Credit Agreement, which if converted in full as of the date hereof would result in 3,000,000 shares of common stock being issued to the Trust. If the Company were to borrow an additional $2.0 million under the Credit Agreement and the Trust converted the entire $5.0 million principal amount into conversion shares, then based on the initial conversion price, the Trust would be entitled to convert such advances into an additional 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The conversion price is subject to downward adjustment in the event of future issuances by the Company of common stock below $1.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions for stock options, restricted stock or other securities granted under Company incentive plans, non-qualified stock options granted by the Board and securities sold in public offerings by the Company. Accordingly, any conversion by the Trust of amounts loaned to us under the Credit Agreement may result in substantial dilution to other existing stockholders of the Company. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock upon the conversion by the Trust of amounts borrowed by the Company under the Credit Agreement could also have an adverse effect on the market price, if any, for our common stock at the time of conversion.\nOur majority stockholder is also one of the Company\u2019s largest unsecured creditors.\nThe lender to the Company under the Credit Agreement is the Trust, who is also the Company\u2019s majority stockholder. As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the Trust has become the Company\u2019s largest unsecured creditor. As an unsecured creditor, the Trust has rights and interests as a lender to the Company, which are different than those rights and interests that the Trust and other Company stockholders have as equity holders in the Company.\nRisks Associated with Possible Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions\nIf we cannot successfully implement any future acquisitions or other strategic transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOn occasion, we evaluate business opportunities and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. We could decide to pursue one or more of these opportunities by acquisition or internal development. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of evaluating, negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures;\n\u2022\nour exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees of an acquired operation.\nIn addition, an acquisition or other strategic transactions could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ncharges to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs for the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ninterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u2022\nany issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transactions that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current common stockholders.\nWe have had limited experience in executing and implementing strategic transactions. Although we have implemented other strategic transactions, those ventures have not always been successful, and we may not succeed in the future. The risks associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Changing Economic Conditions\nGeneral domestic and international economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and common stock price.\nAs a result of the current economic uncertainty and macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, some of our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases of courses from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen.\nThe United States government\u2019s inability to agree on a federal budget may adversely impact our operations and financial results. We derive a significant amount of our revenues from the U.S. federal government.\nWe believe the implementation by the U.S. federal government of the automatic spending cuts commonly referred to as \u201cSequestration\u201d in 2013 had a significant negative impact on our North American operations as our government customers faced uncertainty over whether the amount of funds allotted for training was actually available. We believe that this uncertainty then and in the years that have followed led to lower enrollments and cancellation of existing enrollments from the government sector and to some degree from those of our commercial customers that rely heavily on government contracts. The U.S. federal government has been operating under short-term spending bills which can lead to government agencies using our services, not being allocated sufficient funds. Such agencies may then not be able to continue using our services, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nUnited States government action or inaction with respect to the continuing budget deficit could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nThe inability of the United States Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, another sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the United States Government could adversely impact demand for our services by limiting the funding available to many of our customers, particularly those in the government sector. Various entities of the United States government and United States government contractors, on a combined basis, account for more than fifteen percent of our business. Implementation of major legislative reductions to the federal budget could reduce, delay or cancel funding used by our government and government contractor customers to purchase our services, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nDomestic and/or International Economic Downturns.\nA significant part of our revenues comes from Fortune 1000-level companies, their international equivalents, and government organizations. During weak economic conditions, our sales grow more slowly or can even diminish. If the domestic and/or international economy were to continue to weaken, the demand for our services could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nIndustry-Specific Slowdowns.\nOur customers generally operate in the finance, computer, communications, electronics, systems integration, aerospace, government and military, manufacturing, and energy sectors. When one or more of these industries experiences a slowdown, it can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nGlobalization Issues.\nOur operations are concentrated in Europe and North America, which have traditionally been the centers of IT development and implementation. In recent years, there has been increasing IT activity in other parts of the world, such as China and India. If this trend adversely affects IT jobs in regions in which we have our principal operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could adversely impact the interests of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Bylaws, as amended, and Delaware law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might benefit our stockholders. These provisions may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of our common stock. Some examples of these provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as amended, are:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations of the rights of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of stockholder actions by written consent.\nNatural Disasters, External Strikes, Acts of War or Terrorism and Other External Events\nSince our founding in 1974, various natural disasters, external labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external factors have from time to time impaired our ability to conduct our business, resulted in the loss of revenue or otherwise affected our operating results. When these or other external events occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nNatural Disasters.\nNatural disasters can affect our business. For example, severe weather has at times prevented our course participants from traveling to our courses. In these situations, we try to transfer the course participants to later courses, but we may still lose some revenue.\nExternal Strikes.\nWe have had to react to postal, transportation, and other strikes in the countries where we operate. Transportation strikes can make it difficult for our course participants or our instructors to reach course facilities. Although we try to employ strategies to mitigate the impact of external strikes, these alternative means are rarely completely effective and generally increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nActs of War or Terrorism.\nThreats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe and in other countries and continuing hostilities in the Middle East and elsewhere have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world. These and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets, including financial markets in the United States. In addition, threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause course participants to be reluctant regarding or prevented from traveling to our course facilities, thereby resulting in lower attendance rates. Additionally, our suppliers and service providers may be unable to provide required services or materials. These impacts could happen after we have committed to all the costs of our course, so that we would be unable to quickly adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues caused by these events, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nOther External Factors.\nOther factors outside our control can affect our operations, including those related to our suppliers and service providers. For example, disruptions of telephone networks can prevent customers from enrolling in our courses; disruptions in transportation services can prevent customers from reaching our facilities, and power outages can prevent us from delivering courses.", "PERMNO": 82720, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LTRE"}
