You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Part II, Item 7. entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in any documents incorporated in this Annual Report by reference, before deciding whether to invest in our common shares. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed all known material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See also \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and growth could be harmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19, or other public health pandemics or epidemics, impact our employees, operations, customers, suppliers and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic (and whether there is a resurgence or multiple resurgences of the virus in the future, including as a result of strain variations); the actions taken by governments and public health officials in response to the pandemic; the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, approvals thereof and the speed of vaccine distribution; the impact on construction activity (including related supply chain and labor shortages and their effects on construction schedules and timing); the effect on our customers\u2019 demand for our DIRTT solutions; our ability to manufacture and sell our products; and the ability of our customers to pay for our products. For example, while many of our products support life sustaining activities and essential construction, we, and certain of our customers or suppliers, may be impacted by state or provincial actions, orders and policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses, shelter-in-place orders, and travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, the implementation and enforcement of which may vary by individual jurisdictions. On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued executive orders establishing, among other things, new vaccination requirements applicable to U.S. federal workers and contractors, large employers and healthcare workers. Subject to limited exceptions, the executive order requires U.S. employees of federal contractors to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by January 18, 2022. In January 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia issued a ruling enjoining the vaccine mandate portion of the executive order. As a federal contractor, we are subject to the executive order and, despite the injunction, have implemented mandatory vaccination rules for all U.S. employees and subcontractors to satisfy the requirements by January 18, 2022. Further, additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Our implementation of these rules may result in attrition, including attrition of skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs. Additionally, our implementation of these rules may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory arrangements with third-party vendors and service providers, to the extent they are subject to vaccination requirements and they or their employees are unable or unwilling to comply. Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe shareholder meeting requisition notice delivered by 22NW Fund, LP (\u201c22NW Fund\u201d) could cause us to incur substantial costs, disrupt our operations and strategy, divert the board\u2019s and management\u2019s attention, or have other material adverse effects on us.\nOn November 17, 2021, 22NW Fund took steps to requisition a special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders in order to remove six of the independent directors of the Company and replace them with hand-picked nominees of Mr. Aron English of 22NW Fund. The intentions of 22NW Fund may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. Responding to such actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and strategy, and divert the attention of the board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and our management team from running our business, executing our strategic plan and maximizing performance for our shareholders. In addition, the uncertainty arising from the shareholder requisition could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our\nbusiness or instability with our Distribution Partners, clients, suppliers or customers, which may be exploited by our competitors, and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Moreover, the results of the requisition could impact the strategic direction of the Company in a manner that is adverse to our business and operating results.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategic plan or managing growth.\nIn November 2019, we unveiled a four-year strategic plan to scale our business based on three key pillars: commercial execution, manufacturing excellence and innovation. We have implemented several steps in furtherance of our strategic plan, including improvements in our commercial function and enhancements to our product suite and software platform.\nWhile we are confident in our strategy, we no longer believe that the financial targets articulated in November 2019 will be achieved by the end of 2023. Implementation of our strategy will require maturity of systems and processes across the organization. There is also no assurance that successful implementation will lead to sustainable, profitable growth, and may itself be disruptive to the Company. Failure to implement our strategic plan could materially and adversely affect our near-term sales, commercial activities, and ability to develop and sustain profitable growth. In addition, the success and timing of our implementation may be dependent upon external factors outside of our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative impact on construction activities as a whole. However, we remain confident that DIRTT\u2019s value proposition will be as or even more relevant in the post-pandemic world.\nOur strategy also depends in part on our ability to maintain and manage growth effectively. Growth in our headcount and operations may place significant demands on our management and operational and financial resources. Additionally, managing growth of our operations and personnel requires continuous improvement of our internal controls and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty providing current DIRTT Solutions and introducing future solutions, difficulty in securing clients and Distribution Partners, declines in quality or client satisfaction, increases in costs or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could lead to a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect our business performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in educating potential clients about the benefits of our innovative and unique approach to interior construction as compared to traditional interior construction methods.\nWe operate in the highly competitive interior construction industry that is constantly developing and changing. We compete against conventional construction firms, individual tradespeople and modular systems and commercial furniture manufacturers. New market entrants and conventional construction firms are also beginning to develop customizable wall paneling and other modular interior construction solutions, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, we may face pricing pressure from competitors or new market entrants who take on projects at reduced prices or employ other competitive strategies. While we believe our innovative design, quality, schedule and cost certainty, and network of Distribution Partners makes us well-positioned in the market, increasing competition could make it difficult to secure new projects at acceptable operating margins.\nOur products are unique and offer an alternative to traditional construction techniques. Although offsite construction methods are gaining market acceptance, this still represents only a fraction of all construction methods and the overall construction market. Our ability to grow and increase market share depends, in part, on our success in continuing to increase demand for modular construction methods and products as an alternative to more traditional construction methods. While we intend to follow a strategy of innovative product development and strategic marketing efforts to enhance our position, there is no assurance that our solutions will attain a degree of market acceptance sufficient for sustained profitable operations. Failure to compete effectively by, among other things, meeting consumer preferences, developing and marketing innovative solutions, maintaining strong client service and distribution relationships, growing market share, and expanding our solutions capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur former co-founders\u2019 competitive behavior against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur co-founders and former executives, Mogens Smed and Barrie Loberg, have started an interior construction and manufacturing company that we believe competes with us. They, along with a number of our former employees and Distribution Partners who have joined their company have in-depth knowledge about our business, including our customers, employees, products and prospects, and we may be adversely affected by increased competition arising out of this business venture. We are engaged in litigation with Messrs. Smed and Loberg, entities with which they are involved, and other individuals relating to, among other things, enforcement of non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, alleged patent infringement, and alleged misappropriation of proprietary information by them or by us. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If Messrs. Smed and Loberg further engage in a competitive business against us or if we are not successful in litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend heavily on our network of Distribution Partners, and the loss or inattention of our Distribution Partners, or the failure of our Distribution Partners to meet their obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently do not engage in many direct sales projects and rely almost exclusively on our network of Distribution Partners to promote brand awareness, sell and market DIRTT Solutions, and provide design, installation, distribution and other services to clients on each project. While we are not dependent on any single Distribution Partner, sales generated by approximately 10% of our Distribution Partners comprised approximately 40% of our total revenues for 2021 (2020 - 40%). The loss of any top performing Distribution Partners, particularly to our competitors, may negatively affect our sales, financial condition or results of operations. It may further impair our ability to maintain a market presence in a particular geographic region until a new Distribution Partner relationship is established, which would require significant time and resources.\nAlthough we provide our Distribution Partners with training, education and support, they may be unable to successfully sell our DIRTT Solutions, execute projects or manage client experiences and relationships. In addition, our Distribution Partners and their clients may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could result in the delay or cancellation of their plans to purchase DIRTT Solutions or lead to our inability to obtain payment of accounts receivable that they may owe. If we are unable to maintain a successful Distribution Partner network, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Products and Software\nWe may be unsuccessful in designing, introducing or selling new, innovative solutions, solution features or software.\nOur future success depends in part on our continuing ability to promote and demonstrate the value proposition of DIRTT Solutions, as well as our ability to develop and sell new, innovative solutions, solution features or software that differentiate our solutions and achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. We incur significant costs associated with the investment in our research and development in furtherance of our strategy that may not result in increased revenue or demand for DIRTT Solutions and that could negatively affect our results of operations. Rapidly changing technology, evolving regulatory and industry standards, and changing consumer trends, demands and requirements require us to continuously innovate and develop new, high-quality solutions, solutions features and software. Additionally, such rapid technological changes, standards and preferences could render the complex and proprietary technology of our software and solutions obsolete. We may also be unable to successfully address these developments on a timely basis, or at all. New solutions, solution features or software may also be less successful than we anticipated, and such offerings may fail to achieve market acceptance. If we fail to respond quickly and cost-effectively to a changing market and changing consumer preferences, our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur software and products may have design defects, deficiencies, or risks, and we may incur additional costs to fix any defects, deficiencies or risks, or be subject to warranty or product liability claims.\nOur software and solutions are complex and must meet the technical requirements of our clients and applicable building codes and regulations. Our solutions may contain undetected errors or design and manufacturing defects, and our software may experience quality or reliability problems, or contain bugs or other defects. Software defects may also cause errors in our manufacturing or miscalculations in ordering pricing and could lead us to incur losses and lose market share to competitors. Product or software defects could cause us to incur warranty costs, product liability costs, and repair and remediation costs. Although we maintain warranty reserves based on production, historical claims and estimates, future warranty claims may exceed this amount. Similarly, while we maintain insurance of the types and amounts we consider commercially prudent and consistent with industry practice, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against substantial claims. Such claims can be expensive to defend, could divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and could result in negative publicity. Increased costs to address product warranty claims or to defend against product liability claims may result in increased expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and commodities which could adversely affect our liquidity, operating margins and financial condition.\nWe purchase raw materials, including aluminum, glass and wood, from a number of local and global suppliers. The costs of these commodities can fluctuate due to changes in global supply and demand, speculation in commodities futures, and changes in tariffs or trade barriers, which can also interrupt supply. In addition, we have not historically entered into long-term agreements with vendors and may be exposed to short-term and long-term price fluctuations as a result.\nAluminum represents the largest component of our raw materials consumption. We have experienced fluctuations in the price of aluminum and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in the future. In particular, during 2021 we experienced significant price inflation across substantially all of our materials, largely due to pandemic-induced supply chain constraints, and it is unclear whether such price increases will be temporary or permanent in nature. Since 2018, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and limited the amounts of steel and aluminum coming into the United States based on the countries of origin of those\nimports. In 2021 and 2020, we sourced the majority of our aluminum from North America and sourced under 10% of our raw materials from outside North America. Nonetheless, substantial, prolonged upward trends in aluminum and other commodity prices, along with tariffs and import limitations, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our liquidity, operating margins and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for certain key components and materials, and failure or delay in obtaining the necessary components or materials could delay or prevent the manufacturing or distribution of our DIRTT Solutions.\nWe rely on certain key suppliers for raw materials and components, including aluminum, glass, wood and hardware. We maintain multiple suppliers for key materials, although for the year ended December 31, 2021, one supplier accounted for approximately 59% of our aluminum supply with three additional suppliers providing approximately 14% each, two suppliers accounted for approximately 58% and 36% of our wood supply, and one supplier accounted for approximately 44% of our hardware supply. While we believe there are other vendors for most of our key requirements, certain materials and components meeting our quality standards are available only through a limited number of vendors. If we are required to obtain another source for these materials or components, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms or on terms comparable to our competitors. Any failure or delay in obtaining the necessary raw materials or components in the quantities and quality required may result in increased costs and delays in manufacturing or distributing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. A vendor may also choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship with us due to general economic concerns or specific concerns relating to that vendor or us, at any time. These modifications might include additional requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or with letters of credit. Any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Market Conditions\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions and financial markets may impact our ability to do business and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Overall declines or reductions in construction and renovation due to economic downturns, unemployment and office vacancies, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, and imposition of trade barriers can impact the demand for our products. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, Distribution Partners or clients could also result in, among other things, inadequate project financing, project delays, inability to pay accounts receivable or disruptions in our supply chain. Any general economic, political or social conditions that may contribute to financial difficulties experienced by us, our suppliers, Distribution Partners or clients may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rates, tax rates and other fluctuations, including those resulting from changes in laws.\nOur revenues and expenses are collected and paid in different currencies, including the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. Fluctuations in the relative values of any such currency expose us to foreign exchange risk and could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows, revenues and results of operations. We also have currency exchange exposure to the extent of a mismatch between foreign-currency denominated revenues and expenditures - in particular, where U.S. dollar revenues do not equal U.S. dollar expenditures. We are not currently using exchange rate derivatives to manage currency exchange rate risks. There are currently no significant restrictions on the repatriation of capital and distribution of earnings to foreign entities from any of the jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed in the future.\nCompliance with new or amended tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We base our tax positions upon our understanding of the tax laws (including, applicable tax treaties) of the countries in which we have assets or conduct business activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenges by taxing authorities, including as to the computation and allocation of income, transfer pricing and other complex issues. This includes adverse changes to the manner in which Canada, the United States and other countries tax local and foreign corporations and interpret or change their tax laws and applicable tax treaties, including in light of the increased focus by the U.S. Congress, the Canadian government, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we do business on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which such jurisdictions may amend their tax laws, review our tax positions, or assess additional taxes or interest and penalties on such taxes. In addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our cash management strategies, local tax rates, or interpretations of tax laws.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property and Information Security\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately from infringement by third parties, and we may also be subject to claims that we infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on a combination of contract, copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and other measures to protect our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that our various patents, copyrights or trademarks will offer sufficient protection and prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights in our products, software or processes. We also may not be granted patents, copyrights or trademarks on our pending or proposed applications, and granted applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours. We enforce our intellectual property rights where appropriate, but the cost of doing so may be substantial and could outweigh the potential benefits, and we may be unsuccessful in our enforcement efforts. Failure to protect or maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property could adversely affect our ability to sell original products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our competitors or other third parties may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our technology, including ICE Software, manufacturing processes, and DIRTT Solutions. Although we do not believe that our software or DIRTT Solutions infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties, claims may arise regarding infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims). Such assertions or prosecutions, regardless of their merit, may subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from assembling or licensing certain of our products, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the marketplaces in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. A damages award against us could include an award of royalties or lost profits and, if the court finds willful infringement, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. This may cause us to expend significant costs and resources, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our reputation and profitability could be negatively affected.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we generate, collect and store confidential and proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. We use automated software and hardware solutions to protect our on-premise and cloud infrastructure; conduct routine third-party evaluations and vulnerability testing to identify and mitigate risks; and deploy training programs throughout the company. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, but to our knowledge, we have not experienced any material disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems or platforms. However, there is no guarantee that our security systems, processes or procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, misuse of data, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of a client, Distribution Partner, employee, supplier or Company information could result in financial losses, exposure to litigation risks and liability (including regulatory liability), damage to our reputation, and disruptions in our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance of the types and amounts, we consider it commercially prudent and consistent with industry practice, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses relating to an information security breach.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and frequently changing requirements, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. The costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could be substantial and adversely affect our business. A significant compromise of sensitive employee, Distribution Partner, client or supplier data in our possession could result in legal damages and regulatory penalties. In addition, the costs of defending such actions or remediating breaches could be material.\nDamage to our information technology and software systems could impair our ability to effectively provide DIRTT Solutions and adversely affect our reputation, relationships with clients, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology and software networks and systems, which include the processing, transmission and storage of information, are integrated with our manufacturing processes and essential to our business operations. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, network failures or natural disasters, loss or corruption of data, human error, employee misconduct and difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems. While we maintain retention backups to geo-diverse digital and physical locations and have a recovery data center, the data center and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate. Any disruption in our systems or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in delayed manufacturing and delivery of our DIRTT Solutions, legal claims, a\nloss of intellectual property and a disruption in operations, all of which could adversely affect our reputation, relationships with clients, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulations and Enforcement\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other requirements with respect to workers\u2019 health and safety and environmental matters in the United States, Canada and other countries in which we operate. Environmental laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the production, processing, preparation, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and management of wastes and other substances, and the prevention and remediation of environmental effects. Health and safety laws and regulations impose, among other things, requirements designed to ensure the protection of workers. New or more stringent laws and regulations, including those relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, may be adopted in the future and could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our solutions, and our clients, which could reduce demand for our solutions or cause us to incur additional operating costs. In addition, certain foreign laws and regulations may affect our ability to export products outside of or import products into the United States or Canada. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in civil or criminal liability, damages and fines, and our operations could be curtailed, suspended or shutdown and our reputation, ability to attract employees, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Private lawsuits, including claims for remediation of contamination, personal injury or property damage, or actions by regional, national, state and local regulatory agencies, including enforcement or cost-recovery actions, may materially increase our costs.\nThese factors may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our processes into compliance with legal requirements and impose additional expenses on our operations. In addition, any changes in these laws or regulations or changes in our manufacturing processes may require us to request changes to our existing permits or obtain new permits. We may also be unable to obtain or maintain, from time to time, all required environmental regulatory approvals. A delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or the failure to obtain and comply with such approvals could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Financial Results\nWe have experienced a history of losses, and despite certain periods of profitability in recent years, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since commencing business. We incurred net losses of $53.7 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $111.3 million. These losses and accumulated deficits were due in part to the substantial investments made to grow our business and acquire clients, to further develop our service offerings through product and software development, to ensure that we have sufficient production capacity and capability to deliver on our commitment of rapid delivery times and to preserve our production, innovation and commercial capabilities through the economic disruption caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic in anticipation of a significant increase in construction activity as the pandemic impacts abate. Past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and there can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, quarterly and yearly fluctuations in results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may continue to fluctuate from one quarter or year to another due to a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. For example, we usually experience seasonal slowdowns in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, leading to stronger sales in the second half of the year versus the first half, and weather conditions may also delay delivery and installation on some projects. Furthermore, sales that we anticipate in one quarter may be pushed into another quarter, affecting both quarters\u2019 results, and our actual or projected results of operations may fail to match our past performance. These events could in turn cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate. In particular, if our results of operations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical results of operations, the market price of our common shares will likely decline. Due to our high fixed manufacturing costs and operating expenses, quarterly volatility in sales volumes could result in periods of low operating cash flow and negatively affect our liquidity. Due to these risk factors, quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations may not be an indicator of future performance.\nWe have negative cash flow from operating activities.\nWe had negative cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. Continued negative operating cash flow may compromise our ability to make interest and principal payments on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures issued on January 25, 2021 and December 1, 2021 (collectively, the \u201cDebentures\u201d) on a timely basis, or at all, and to execute our\nstrategic plan. Until we are able to generate positive cash flow from operating activities, our ability to finance our operations will be dependent on our cash reserves and available credit facilities and, if required, our ability to obtain additional external financing. Although we anticipate we will have positive cash flow from operating activities in future periods, we cannot guarantee that such future cash flow will be sufficient or that a prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, or other changes to our circumstances, will not necessitate additional financial resources to fund our operating activities.\nIn response to our negative cash flow from operations, on February 22, 2022, we commenced the process of closing our Phoenix aluminum manufacturing facility, shifting related manufacturing to both our Savannah and Calgary aluminum facilities. This is expected to result in a net headcount reduction of approximately 26 and annualized cost savings of approximately $2.4 million. Additionally, we announced our intention to eliminate approximately 18% of our salaried workforce including manufacturing and office positions which, along with other cost reduction initiatives, are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately $13.0. One-time costs associated with these workforce reductions and other costs savings measures are approximately $5 million.\nWe have recognized, and may recognize in the future, impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other non-current assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we impaired the $1.4 million net carrying value of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, planned or unexpected significant changes in the use of the assets, and sustained market capitalization declines may result in the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. We annually test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. Based on our testing, the fair value of goodwill did not exceed the carrying value of its net assets and, accordingly, the entire $1.4 million balance of goodwill was impaired as at December 31, 2021. Any further charges relating to impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment is recognized.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares and Corporate Structure\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the TSX under the symbol \u201cDRT\u201d and on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cDRTT.\u201d The price of our common shares has in the past fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. These factors include: (i) variations in quarterly results of operations; (ii) deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; (iii) changes in earnings estimates by analysts; (iv) our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; (v) general conditions in the offsite construction and manufacturing industries; (vi) sales of our common shares by our significant shareholders; (vii) fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and (viii) other general economic conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been brought against that company. If our share price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation in both the United States and Canada. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws of Alberta, Canada, which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws of the United States.\nWe are governed by the ABCA and other relevant laws, which may affect the rights of shareholders differently than those of a company governed by the laws of a U.S. jurisdiction, and may, together with our charter documents, have the effect of delaying, deterring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of our company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or may affect the price an acquiring party would be willing to offer in such an instance. The material differences between the ABCA and Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), that may have the greatest such effect include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) for certain extraordinary corporate transactions (such as amalgamations or amendments to our articles), the ABCA generally requires the voting threshold to be a special resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by the shareholders who voted in respect of the resolution, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote; and (ii) under the ABCA, registered holders or beneficial owners (as defined in the ABCA) of not less than 5% of our common shares in aggregate can requisition our directors to call a special meeting of shareholders, whereas such right does not exist under the DGCL. We cannot predict whether investors will find our company and our common shares less attractive because we are governed by the corporate laws of Alberta, Canada.\nBecause we are a corporation incorporated in Alberta and some of our directors and officers are residents of Canada, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us or our directors and officers based solely upon the\nfederal securities laws of the United States. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to enforce civil liabilities against our directors and officers residing outside of Canada.\nWe are a corporation amalgamated and existing under the laws of Alberta with our principal place of business in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Some of our directors and officers are residents of Canada and a substantial portion of our assets and those of such persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for U.S. investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or blue sky laws of any state within the United States or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue sky laws.\nSimilarly, some of our directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside Canada. As a result, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against these non-Canadian residents. In addition, it may not be possible for Canadian investors to collect from these non-Canadian residents judgments obtained in courts in Canada predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces and territories of Canada. It may also be difficult for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States, based solely on violations of federal, provincial or territorial securities laws.\nGeneral Risks\nDifficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified officers or employees, or experiencing labor shortages or disruptions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel as needed. We are currently searching for a permanent replacement for our chief executive officer position; however, the marketplace for attracting senior executives is competitive, and there can be no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of our search for a new chief executive officer. Although we anticipate smooth transitions, any changes to members of our senior management may be disruptive to our operations, including by diverting our Board\u2019s and management\u2019s time and attention and a decline in employee morale. If there are any delays in this process, our business could be negatively impacted. We may be affected by labor shortages or disruptions, particularly in locations where we operate manufacturing facilities. If we fail to attract or retain qualified personnel, or experience labor shortages or disruptions, we could incur higher recruiting expenses, a loss of manufacturing capabilities, or inability to respond to significant increases in demand, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may have additional capital needs in the future and may not be able to obtain additional capital or financing on acceptable terms.\nWe plan to continually invest in business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business opportunities, such as expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing new software, acquiring complementary businesses, products or technology, and expanding or enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, including factory automation. To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may need to undertake equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities may result in significant share dilution. Additional new equity securities issued could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our currently issued and outstanding common shares. Additional debt financings may involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We cannot provide any assurance that sufficient debt or equity financing will be available for necessary or desirable expenditures or acquisitions, or to cover losses, and accordingly, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may engage in future mergers, acquisitions, agreements, consolidations or other corporate transactions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any businesses, we may, in the future, seek to expand our business and capabilities through acquiring compatible technology, products or businesses. Additionally, we may explore other corporate transactions, including mergers, agreements, consolidations, or joint ventures, that we believe may be beneficial to our business or further specific business goals. Acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) difficulty integrating the newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; (ii) inability to maintain relationships with key clients, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses; (iii) potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; (iv) exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with our assumption of certain claims and liabilities of the acquired businesses; (v) diversion of management\u2019s time and focus; and (vi) possible write-offs or impairment charges related to the acquired businesses. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 19005, "SIC": 2522, "TIC": "DRTT"}
