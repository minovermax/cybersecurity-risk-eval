{"cik": "1297401", "company": "DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others acting on our behalf, our beliefs and our management\u2019s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur success is primarily dependent on audience acceptance of our films, which is extremely difficult to predict and, therefore, inherently risky.\nWe cannot predict the economic success of any of our motion pictures because the revenue derived from the distribution of a motion picture (which does not necessarily directly correlate with the production or distribution costs incurred) depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be accurately predicted. The economic success of a motion picture also depends upon the public\u2019s acceptance of competing films, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure-time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe economic success of a motion picture is largely determined by our ability to produce content and develop stories and characters that appeal to a broad audience and by the effective marketing of the motion picture. The theatrical performance of a film is a key factor in predicting revenue from post-theatrical markets. If we are unable to accurately judge audience acceptance of our film content or to have the film effectively marketed, the commercial success of the film will be in doubt, which could result in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any particular feature film will generate enough revenue to offset its distribution, fulfillment services and marketing costs, in which case we would not receive any revenues for such film from our distributors. Some of our films (including our July 2013 theatrical release Turbo, our March 2014 theatrical release Mr. Peabody and Sherman and our November 2014 theatrical release The Penguins of Madagascar) have not recovered their production costs. See \"-We may incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing and distribution costs.\"\nWe may incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing and distribution costs.\nWe are required to amortize capitalized production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from the associated films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project-by-project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual feature film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. For instance, in the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we incurred a write-down of $13.5 million for our film Turbo and in the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred write-downs of $66.5 million for our film Mr. Peabody and Sherman and $30.3 million for our film The Penguins of Madagascar. Such impairment charges adversely impacted our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is currently substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases each year and the unexpected delay or commercial failure of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nWe generally expect to release two animated feature films per year. The unexpected delay in release or commercial failure of just one of these films could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in both the year of release and in the future. Historically, feature films that are successful in the domestic theatrical market are generally also successful in the international theatrical, home entertainment and television markets, although each film is different and there is no way to guarantee such results. If our films fail to achieve domestic box office success, their international box office and home entertainment success and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, we can make no assurances that the historical correlation between domestic box office results and international box office and home entertainment results will continue in the future. In fact, over the last several years domestic theatrical results and foreign theatrical results have become less directly correlated than in the past. While we have generally seen growth in our foreign theatrical results, it has come in countries where the home entertainment market is not as robust as in the U.S. or Western Europe.\nOur home entertainment and consumer products businesses have experienced and will likely continue to experience significant changes as a result of rapid technological change and shifting consumer preferences and behavior. These changes and shifting preferences have generally resulted in a decrease of the revenue from and profitability of our films.\nOur businesses create entertainment and products whose ultimate success significantly depends on the current state of our technology, as well as shifting consumer tastes and preferences. A significant amount of our revenues and profitability has historically resulted from sales of DVDs in the home entertainment market. Over the last 10 years, there has been a significant decline in both the number of DVD units sold and the profitability of such units. We believe that this decline is a result of various technological advances and changes in consumer preferences and behavior. Consumers (especially children) are spending an increasing amount of time on the Internet and mobile devices, and technology in these areas continues to evolve rapidly. In addition, consumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from the Internet, on their televisions and on handheld or portable devices. As a result, consumer demand for DVDs has declined sharply. We and our distributors must adapt our businesses to changing consumer behavior and preferences and exploit new distribution channels (such as Internet distribution) or find new and enhanced ways to deliver our films in the home entertainment market. There can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to achieve historical revenues or margin levels in such business.\nDuring 2014, two large retailers, Walmart and Target, accounted for approximately 58% of our domestic (U.S. and Canada) DVD sales. If these and other retailers' support of the DVD format decreases, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results fluctuate significantly.\nWe continue to expect significant fluctuations in our future quarterly and annual operating results because of a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential varying levels of success of our feature films, television series and specials, new media business and other entertainment;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and timing of the domestic and international theatrical releases and home entertainment release of our feature films;\n\u2022\nour distribution arrangements with our principal distributors permit our distributors to collect distribution fees and to recoup distribution costs, including print and advertising costs, and cause us to recognize significantly less revenue and expenses from a film in the period of a film\u2019s initial theatrical release than we otherwise would absent these agreements;\n\u2022\nthe timing of development expenses and varying levels of success of our new business ventures; and\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our consumer products and other businesses.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a single source, the production of animated family entertainment, which could adversely affect us.\nUnlike most of the major studios, which are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, we currently depend primarily on the success of our feature films and other properties. For example, unlike us, many of the\nmajor studios are part of corporate groups that include television networks and cable channels that can provide stable sources of earnings and cash flows that offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their feature films. We, on the other hand, currently derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a single source-our animated family entertainment-and our lack of a sufficiently diversified business model could adversely affect us if our feature films or other properties fail to perform to our expectations.\nWe have recently developed and are currently in the process of developing a number of projects that are not feature films, which will involve upfront and ongoing expenses and may not ultimately be successful.\nAs part of our strategy of diversifying our revenue sources, over the last several years we have produced and are currently developing a number of projects that are not feature films. These projects include location-based entertainment, episodic series, technology initiatives, our Chinese Joint Venture and our ATV Joint Venture. Some of these new businesses are inherently riskier than our traditional animated feature film business. These projects also require varying amounts of upfront and ongoing expenditures, some of which are or may be significant, and may place a strain on the Company's management and capital resources. While we currently believe that we have adequate sources of capital to fund these development and operating expenditures, there can be no assurances that such resources will be available to us. Further, to the extent that the Company needs to hire additional personnel to develop or oversee these projects, the Company may be unable to hire talented individuals. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that all or any of these projects will ultimately be completed or, if completed, successful.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a long-term agreement with Netflix, in May 2014 with the German television network Super RTL and, in February 2014, with southern European media company Planeta Junior regarding the production and distribution of existing and future episodic series. Each agreement provides for the Company to deliver over 1,000 episodes of newly created series based on the Company's properties. The Company may have difficulty in producing the required programming for a variety of reasons, including difficulties in hiring the significant additional personnel required to develop and oversee these projects. We currently expect that we will use third-party production companies to assist in the production of some or all of these projects; however, we may have difficulty in engaging such production companies on profitable terms or at all. These projects will require significant expenditures, many of which will be incurred prior to the receipt of any license fees from Netflix, Super RTL or other licensees. While we believe that we will have adequate sources of capital to fund these expenses, there can be no assurances that sufficient capital will be available. The agreements with Netflix, Super RTL, Planeta Junior and other licensees provide for fixed license fees to the Company; therefore, our financial results associated with the agreements will be dependent on our ability to adequately monitor and control production expenses as well as our ability to enter into additional license agreements in other territories. The Company currently expects that some or all of the new series production will occur in jurisdictions that offer tax incentives; however, there can be no assurances that these tax incentives will continue to be offered or that the Company will be able to benefit from them. Finally, the supervision of this expanded television series production business may place an added burden on the Company's management team.\nAnimated films are expensive to produce and the uncertainties inherent in their production could result in the expenditure of significant amounts on films that are abandoned or significantly delayed.\nAnimated films are expensive to produce. The production, completion and distribution of animated feature films are subject to a number of uncertainties, including delays and increased expenditures due to creative problems, technical difficulties, talent availability, accidents, natural disasters or other events beyond our control. Because of these uncertainties, the projected costs of an animated feature film at the time it is set for production may increase, the date of completion may be substantially delayed or the film may be abandoned due to the exigencies of production. In extreme cases, a film in production may be abandoned or significantly modified (including as a result of creative changes) after substantial amounts have been spent, causing the write-off of expenses incurred with respect to the film. For example, in January 2015, the Company announced that, in connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan, the Company was writing off the capitalized expenses associated with multiple film properties.\nAnimated films typically take longer to produce than live-action films, which increases the uncertainties inherent in their production and distribution.\nAnimated feature films typically take three to four years (or longer) to produce after the initial development stage, as opposed to an average of 12 to 18 months for live-action films. The additional time that it takes to produce and release an animated feature film increases the risk that our films in production will fall out of favor with target audiences and that competing films will be released in advance of or concurrently with ours, either of which risks could reduce the demand for or popular appeal of our films.\nThe production and marketing of animated feature films and other properties is capital-intensive and our capacity to generate cash from our films may be insufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements.\nThe costs to develop, produce and market a film are substantial. In 2014, for example, we spent approximately $345.0 million to fund production costs (excluding overhead expense) and to make contingent compensation and residual payments. Although we generally retain the right to exploit each of the films that we have previously released, the size of our film library is much smaller than the film libraries of the major U.S. movie studios, which typically have the ability to exploit hundreds of library titles. Library titles can provide a stable source of earnings and cash flows that supplement the cash flow generated by newly released films. Many of the major studios use these cash flows, as well as cash flows from their other businesses, to finance the production and marketing of new feature films. We are not able to rely on such cash flows to the same extent and are required to fund our films in development and production and other commitments with cash retained from operations, the proceeds of films that are generating revenue from theatrical, home entertainment and ancillary markets and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. If our films fail to perform, we may be forced to seek sources of outside financing. Such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts for us to continue to make substantial investments in the production of new animated feature films or may be available only on terms that are disadvantageous to us, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, growth or business.\nWe compete for audiences based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe number of animated and live-action feature films released by competitors, particularly the major U.S. motion picture studios, may create an oversupply of product in the market and may make it more difficult for our films to succeed. In particular, we compete directly against other animated films and family-oriented live-action films. Oversupply of such products (especially of high-profile \u201cevent\u201d films such as ours) may become most pronounced during peak release times, such as school holidays, national holidays and the summer release season, when theater attendance has traditionally been highest. Although we seek to release our films during peak release times, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to release all of our films during those times and, therefore, may miss potentially higher gross box-office receipts. In addition, a substantial majority of the motion picture screens in the U.S. typically are committed at any one time to only 10 to 15 films distributed nationally by major studio distributors. If our competitors were to increase the number of films available for distribution and the number of exhibition screens remained unchanged, it could be more difficult for us to release our films during optimal release periods.\nChanges in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOver the last several years, the global economy has experienced a significant contraction. This decrease and any future decrease in economic activity in the U.S. or in other regions of the world in which we do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways. Any decline in economic conditions may reduce the performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases and purchases of our licensed consumer products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. We may also experience increased returns by the retailers that purchase our home entertainment releases. Further, bankruptcies or similar events by retailers, theater chains, television networks, other participants in our distribution chain or other sources of revenue may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced or otherwise cause our revenues to decrease. In periods of generally increasing prices, or of increased price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, we may experience a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs.\nThe seasonality of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.\nOur business is normally subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of theatrical motion picture and home entertainment releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market. Also, revenues in our consumer products business are influenced by both seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and the timing of animated theatrical releases and generally peak in the fiscal quarter of a film\u2019s theatrical release. We expect that revenues generated by our Classic Media properties, will tend to be higher during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the holiday content offered through television distribution rights as well as home entertainment products geared towards the holiday season. Accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as natural disaster or a terrorist attack during the time of one of our theatrical or home entertainment releases), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on our results for the year.\nStrong existing film studios competing in the CG animated film market and the entrance of additional competing film producers could adversely affect our business in several ways.\nCG animation has been successfully exploited by a growing number of film studios. There are no substantial technological barriers to entry that prevent other film producers from entering the field. Furthermore, advances in technology may substantially decrease the time that it takes to produce a CG animated feature film, which could result in a significant number of new CG animated films or products. The entrance of additional companies into the CG animated feature film market could adversely impact us by eroding our market share, increasing the competition for CG animated film audiences and increasing the competition for, and cost of, hiring and retaining talented employees, particularly CG animators and technical staff.\nOur success depends on certain key employees.\nOur success greatly depends on our employees. In particular, we are dependent upon the services of Jeffrey Katzenberg, our other executive officers and certain creative employees such as directors and producers. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our employees. We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Katzenberg and with all of our top executive officers and production executives. However, although it is standard in the motion picture industry to rely on employment agreements as a method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure us of the continued services of such employees. The loss of the services of Mr. Katzenberg or a substantial group of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur scheduled releases of animated feature films, episodic series and other projects may place a significant strain on our resources.\nWe have established multiple creative and production teams so that we can simultaneously produce several animated feature films and other projects. In the past, we have been required, and will continue to be required, to expand our employee base, increase capital expenditures and procure additional resources and facilities in order to accomplish the scheduled releases of our entertainment projects (including the new content required under our agreement with Netflix). This growth and expansion has placed, and continues to place, a significant strain on our resources. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our projects will be released as targeted or that this strain on resources will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our distributors for the distribution and marketing of our feature films and related products.\nUnder the Paramount Agreements, Paramount and certain of its affiliates, and under the Fox Distribution Agreement, Fox and certain of its affiliates, are responsible for the distribution and servicing of all of our films in substantially all audiovisual media throughout most of the world. If our distributors fail to perform under these agreements, our business reputation, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. For a description of the terms of the Paramount Distribution Agreement, the Paramount Fulfillment Services Agreement and the Fox Distribution Agreement, see \"Item 1 - Business-Distribution and Servicing Arrangements.\"\nWe depend on our distributors to remit most of our revenue to us.\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue through our relationships with our distributors. Most of our revenue is remitted to us by Fox, Paramount and Netflix. Due to our dependence on so few counterparties to remit to us the majority of our revenue, we are subject to credit risk on account of each of these counterparties. If one or more of these counterparties is unable to pay the amounts due to us, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe amount of revenue that we recognize from our films is dependent on the information we receive from our distributors.\nBecause third parties are the principal distributors of our films, the amount of revenue that we recognize from our films in any given period is dependent on the timing, accuracy and sufficiency of the information we receive from our distributors. As is typical in the film industry, our distributors may make adjustments in future periods to information previously provided to us that could have a material impact on our operating results in later periods. Furthermore, management may, in its judgment, make material adjustments to the information reported by our distributors in future periods to ensure that revenues are accurately reflected in our financial statements.\nBoth Fox and Paramount distribute our feature films and related products, and in some cases, the responsibility for distributing and promoting our film franchises will be split between Fox and Paramount.\nUnder the Fox Distribution Agreement, Fox distributes our films and related products released after December 31, 2012, and as of July 1, 2014, Fox has also been licensed and engaged to render fulfillment services for Existing Pictures in theatrical, non-theatrical, home entertainment and transactional digital media. Under the Paramount Agreements, Paramount will continue to exploit and render fulfillment services in the television media for Existing Pictures until the date that is 16 years after such film's theatrical release, and will continue to exploit and service certain other agreements with Paramount's sublicensees that remain in place after July 1, 2014. As a result, one or both of our distributors may focus their efforts on promoting our franchises for which it is the sole distributor, to the detriment of our franchises which include feature films that were released both before and after December 31, 2012 and are therefore distributed by both of our distributors. If the diverging incentives of our distributors, or other complications arising from using multiple distributors, result in less effective promotion of our films and related products, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks relating to the international distribution of our films and related products and to the foreign production of content.\nIn recent years, we have derived approximately 61% of our feature film revenue from the exploitation of our films in territories outside of the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, some of our newer non-feature film businesses are being or are expected to be conducted, at least partially, outside of the U.S. In April 2013, we launched a joint venture, ODW, that will conduct significant operations in China, including the development and exploitation of original content. See \"Item 1 - Business-Joint Ventures and Investments.\" As a result, our business is subject to risks inherent in international trade, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfluctuating foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of the potential effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates, please see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Our Revenue and Costs-Our Revenues-Feature Films\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws regulating interactions and dealings with foreign government officials;\n\u2022\nother laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes and changes in these laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering cultural tastes and attitudes, including varied censorship laws and the regulation of media businesses;\n\u2022\ndiffering degrees of protection for patent rights and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe instability of foreign economies and governments; and\n\u2022\nwar and acts of terrorism.\nPiracy of motion pictures, including digital and Internet piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of our films.\nUnauthorized copying and piracy are prevalent in various parts of the world, including in countries where we may have difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights. Motion picture piracy has been made easier by technological advances and the conversion of motion pictures into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies of motion pictures. The increased consumer acceptance of entertainment content delivered electronically and consumer acquisition of the hardware and software for facilitating electronic delivery may also lead to greater public acceptance of unauthorized content. The proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of these products has an adverse effect on our business because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our legitimate products. Under the Paramount Agreements and the Fox Distribution Agreement, our distributors are substantially responsible for enforcing our intellectual property rights with respect to all of our films subject to such agreements and are required to maintain security and anti-piracy measures consistent with the highest levels each maintains for its own motion pictures in each territory in the world. Other than the remedies we have in such agreements, we have no way of requiring our distributors to take any anti-piracy actions, and our distributors\u2019 failure to take such actions may result in our having to undertake such measures ourselves, which could result in significant expenses and losses of indeterminate amounts of revenue. Even if applied, there can be no assurance that the highest levels of security and anti-piracy measures will prevent piracy.\nWe could be adversely affected by strikes and other union activity.\nAlong with the major U.S. film studios, we employ members of IATSE on many of our productions. We are also currently subject to collective bargaining agreements with IATSE and SAG-AFTRA. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements. A strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of our feature films could delay or halt our ongoing production activities. Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time involved, could cause a delay of the release date of our feature films and thereby could adversely affect the revenue that the films generate. In addition, strikes by unions with which we do not have a collective bargaining agreement can have adverse effects on the entertainment industry in general and, thus, indirectly on us.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to outages and interruptions due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events beyond our control. In addition, we currently have two large production facilities in California-one in Southern California, and one in Northern California (which we plan to close in connection with our 2015 Restructuring Plan and consolidate its operations with our Southern California facility). These areas in California have in the past and may in the future be subject to earthquakes as well as electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power. Although we have developed certain plans to respond in the event of a disaster, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in the event of a specific disaster. In the event of a short-term power outage, we have installed UPS (uninterrupted power source) equipment designed to protect our CG animation rendering equipment and other sensitive equipment. A long-term power outage, however, could disrupt our operations. Prices for electricity have in the past risen dramatically and may increase in the future. An increase in prices would increase our operating costs, which could in turn adversely affect our profitability. Although we currently carry business interruption insurance for potential losses (including earthquake-related losses), there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur or that such insurance may continue to be available on affordable terms. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPotential acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions could negatively affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions, in connection with our traditional animation business or new types of businesses. To the extent that we consummate such transactions, there can be no assurance that such acquisitions, joint ventures or other transactions (such as our acquisitions of AwesomenessTV and Classic Media, and our Chinese Joint Venture and ATV Joint Venture) will be successfully integrated by us to the extent required. Additionally, there can be no assurance that such acquisitions, joint ventures or other transactions will not adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acquisition candidates or other potential business partners or that any discussions will result in a consummated transaction. Any such transactions may require significant additional capital resources and there can be no assurance that we will have access to adequate capital resources.\nOur Chinese Joint Venture faces restrictions in China and may not succeed.\nOn April 3, 2013, we formed our Chinese Joint Venture. The purpose of the joint venture is to create a leading China-focused family entertainment company engaged in the acquisition, production and distribution of original content originally produced, released or commercially exploited in the Chinese language. Media and entertainment businesses in China are currently subject to a variety of restrictions, including prohibitions on the conduct of certain activities by foreign-owned entities. Additionally, among other things, there are restrictions on the repatriation of funds earned in China. There can be no assurances that the joint venture will be able to obtain the appropriate authorizations to engage in all contemplated aspects of its business or, if such licenses are obtained, that the joint venture will be successful. The formation of the venture and establishment of its business will require significant management and capital resources and there can be no assurances that such resources will be available.\nA variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our entertainment and consumer products or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nDemand for our products and services is highly dependent on the general environment for entertainment and other leisure activities and consumer tastes and preferences. The environment for these activities can be significantly adversely affected in the U.S. or worldwide as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including terrorist activities, military actions, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters or health concerns. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similarly, an outbreak of a particular infectious disease could negatively affect the public\u2019s willingness to see our films in theaters. Finally, the ongoing effects of global climate change could adversely affect our\nbusiness. Various proposals have been discussed at the federal and state level to limit the carbon emissions of business enterprises, which if enacted could result in an increase in our costs of operations. The effects of climate change could also have unpredictable effects on consumer movie attendance patterns.\nTo be successful, we must continue to attract and retain qualified personnel and our inability to do so would adversely affect the quality of our films.\nOur success continues to depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified creative, technical and managerial personnel. Competition for the caliber of talent required to make our films, particularly for our film directors, producers, writers, animators, creative and technology personnel, will continue to intensify as other studios, some with substantially larger financial resources than ours, build their in-house animation or special-effects capabilities. The entrance of additional film studios into the animated film industry or the increased production capacity of existing film studios will increase the demand for the limited number of talented CG animators and programmers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining such qualified personnel in the future. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future, particularly film directors, producers, animators, creative personnel and technical directors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe depend on technology and computer systems for the timely and successful development of our animated feature films and related products.\nBecause we are dependent upon a large number of software applications and hardware for the development and production of our animated feature films and other projects, an error or defect in the software, a failure in the hardware, a failure of our backup facilities or a delay in delivery of products and services could result in significantly increased production costs for a project. Moreover, if a software or hardware problem is significant enough, it could result in delays in one or more productions, which in turn could result in potentially significant delays in the release dates of our feature films or affect our ability to complete the production of a feature film or other project.\nSignificant delays in production and significant delays in release dates, as well as the failure to complete a production, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we must ensure that our production environment integrates the latest animation tools and techniques developed in the industry so that our projects remain competitive. To accomplish this, we can either develop these capabilities by upgrading our proprietary software, which can result in substantial research and development costs, or we can seek to purchase third-party licenses, which can also result in significant expenditures. In the event we seek to develop these capabilities internally, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. In the event we seek to obtain third-party licenses, we cannot guarantee that they will be available or, once obtained, will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to protect certain of our proprietary technology or enhance or develop new technology.\nWe depend on certain of our proprietary technology to develop and produce our animated feature films and other projects. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright and trade secret protection and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We typically have several patent applications pending in the U.S. or other countries at any given time. We cannot provide any assurances that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or that, if patents do issue, any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or that they will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. From time to time, we make some of our proprietary technology available to our business partners pursuant to agreements containing non-disclosure obligations. In addition, to produce our projects we also rely on third-party software, which is readily available to others. Failure of our patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and the availability of third-party software may make it easier for our competitors to obtain technology equivalent or superior to our technology. If our competitors develop or license technology that is superior to ours or that makes our technology obsolete, we may be required to incur significant costs to enhance or acquire new technology so that our feature films and other projects remain competitive. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, could effectively prevent us from using important technology and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThird-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us in the future.\nIn addition to our proprietary technology, we also rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including software that we use with our proprietary software. We cannot provide any assurances that these third-party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that the technology licenses will not result in intellectual property infringement claims by third parties. The loss of or inability to maintain any of these technology licenses could result in delays in project releases until equivalent technology is identified, licensed and integrated to complete a given project. Any such delays or failures in project releases could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nOne of the risks of the CG animated film production business is the possibility of claims that our projects and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their technology, software, previously developed films, stories, characters, copyrights, trademarks, other entertainment or intellectual property. We have received, and are likely to receive in the future, claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. For many of the properties in the Classic Media library, because of the age of such properties the rights to exploit the properties in newer forms of media may be uncertain or may be split with other rightsholders. Additionally, due to the age of many of the Classic Media properties, in certain countries (including the U.S.) the Company's rights to exploit the properties may be subject to termination or reversionary rights. There can be no assurance that infringement or misappropriation claims (or our business partners' claims for indemnification resulting from such claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us, or that any assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of the validity or the success of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any claims or actions are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We cannot provide any assurances, however, that under such circumstances a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nWe use social media and other Internet websites to market our projects and connect with consumers. In May 2013, we acquired AwesomenessTV, a multi-media platform company that generates revenues primarily from online advertising sales and distribution of content through media channels such as theatrical, home entertainment, television and consumer products. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted aimed at protecting children using the Internet. These laws include the federal Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (\u201cCOPPA\u201d). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what information can be collected from children under the age of 13. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing privacy in general and the protection and use of information received from consumers or other third parties, regardless of age. Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws affecting interaction with children and governing privacy. If the Company's online activities (including through its AwesomenessTV business) were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations, the Company could be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties, and our reputation as a family-friendly content provider could be damaged. Additionally, any unauthorized disclosure by us of consumers' credit card or other personally identifiable information could result in claims and lawsuits against us.\nWe incur significant costs to protect electronically stored data and if our data is compromised despite this protection, we may incur additional costs, business interruption, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.\nWe collect and maintain information and data necessary for conducting our business operations, which information includes proprietary and confidential data and personal information of our customers and employees. Such information is often maintained electronically, which includes risks of intrusion, tampering, manipulation and misappropriation. We implement and maintain systems to protect our digital data, but obtaining and maintaining these systems is costly and usually requires continuous monitoring and updating for technological advances and change. Additionally, we sometimes provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when required in connection with certain business and commercial transactions. For instance, we have relationships with third party vendors to assist in processing employee payroll, and they receive and maintain confidential personal information regarding our employees. We take precautions to try to ensure that such third parties will protect this information, but there remains a risk that the confidentiality of any data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems, or those of our third party vendors and partners, are compromised, there may be negative effects on our business including a loss of business opportunities or disclosure of trade secrets. If the personal information we\nmaintain is tampered with or misappropriated, our reputation and relationships with our partners and customers may be adversely affected, and we may incur significant costs to remediate the problem and prevent future occurrences.\nIf our stock price fluctuates, you could lose a significant part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, productions, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us, the filmmaking industry and the other businesses that we operate.\nOur stock price may also experience fluctuations as a result of the limited number of outstanding shares that are able to be sold in an unrestricted manner (often referred to as the \u201cpublic float\u201d). As a result of our limited public float, large transactions by institutional investors may result in increased volatility in our stock price. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to and disproportionate to the operating performance of movie studios. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe interests of our controlling and significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nWe cannot assure you that the interests of Jeffrey Katzenberg and entities controlled by him will coincide in all instances with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Jeffrey Katzenberg or entities controlled by him, could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock or sell revenue-generating assets. Jeffrey Katzenberg may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of corporate opportunities between us, on the one hand, and certain of our founding stockholders, on the other hand, which could prevent us from taking advantage of certain corporate opportunities. So long as Jeffrey Katzenberg or entities controlled by him continue to collectively own shares of our Class B common stock with significant voting power, Jeffrey Katzenberg or entities controlled by him, will continue collectively to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nAdditionally, at the time of our initial public offering in 2004, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with an affiliate of Paul Allen, who was previously a director and significant stockholder. As a result of certain transactions in which entities controlled by Paul Allen engaged, the tax basis of our assets was partially increased (the \u201cTax Basis Increase\u201d) and the amount of tax we may pay in the future is expected to be reduced during the approximately 15-year amortization period for such increased tax basis. Under the tax receivable agreement, we are required to pay to such affiliate 85% of the amount of any cash savings in certain taxes resulting from the Tax Basis Increase and certain other related tax benefits, subject to repayment if it is determined that these savings should not have been available to us. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we made payments (net of refunds) totaling $16.0 million to Mr. Allen\u2019s affiliate. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we were not required to make any payments. As of December 31, 2014, we have recorded a liability of $10.5 million to Mr. Allen\u2019s affiliate. We expect that $8.3 million will become payable during the next 12 months (which is subject to the finalization of our 2014 tax returns and may be reduced by refunds of overpayments related to prior years) and the remainder will become payable over the next several years. This liability may increase in the future to the extent that new deferred tax assets result in realized tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement or if we release the valuation allowance recorded during 2014.\nAs a result of the tax receivable agreement, the interests of Paul Allen and entities controlled by him and our stockholders could differ. The actual amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors. The payments that may be made to Paul Allen\u2019s affiliate pursuant to the tax receivable agreement could be substantial. For a further discussion of the tax receivable agreement, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Provision for Income Taxes.\u201d\nFuture sales of our shares, including sales that may occur in connection with follow-on offerings that we have agreed to effect for certain of our stockholders, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nJeffrey Katzenberg (or entities controlled by him or permitted transferees) is able to sell shares in the public market from time to time without registering them, subject to certain limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, entities controlled by Jeffrey Katzenberg (and certain of his permitted transferees) have the right to cause us to register the sale of shares of Class A common stock beneficially owned by them. If Jeffrey Katzenberg (or entities controlled by him or permitted transferees) were to sell a large number of their shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAlso, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding common stock.\nThe concentrated ownership of our common stock and certain corporate governance arrangements will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nJeffrey Katzenberg and entities controlled by him own 100% of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 9% of our common equity and approximately 60% of the total voting power of our common stock. Accordingly, Jeffrey Katzenberg or entities controlled by him generally have the collective ability to control (without the consent of our other stockholders) all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination and election of directors, the determination of our corporate and management policies and the determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, the disproportionate voting rights of the Class B common stock relative to the Class A common stock may make us a less attractive takeover target.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our charter and by-laws, as well as Delaware law, may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Additionally, provisions of our charter and by-laws could deter, delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe division of our capital stock into Class A common stock, entitled to one vote per share, and Class B common stock, entitled to 15 votes per share, all of which Class B common stock is owned or controlled by Jeffrey Katzenberg;\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board to issue preferred stock with terms as the board may determine;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nfollowing such time as the outstanding shares of Class B common stock cease to represent a majority of the combined voting power of the voting stock, prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\nfollowing such time as the outstanding shares of Class B common stock cease to represent a majority of the combined voting power of the voting stock, super-majority voting requirements for stockholders to amend the by-laws; and\n\u2022\nstockholder super-majority voting requirements to amend certain provisions of the charter.\nTo service our indebtedness and long-term lease obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d), revolving credit facility, long-term lease obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. The indebtedness under our revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates. Thus, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed had remained the same, and our net income would accordingly decrease.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule (or at all) or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. The ability to borrow funds in the future under our revolving credit facility will depend on our meeting the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing that facility. If we breach any of these covenants, or suffer a material adverse change which restricts our borrowing ability under our revolving credit facility, we would be unable to borrow funds thereunder without a waiver, which inability could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the Senior Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe indenture of our Senior Notes and the agreements governing our revolving credit facility contain various covenants that limit our management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our businesses.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain various provisions that limit our management\u2019s discretion by restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments;\n\u2022\nsell stock in certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nThese restrictions on our management\u2019s ability to operate our businesses in accordance with its discretion could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we default under any financing arrangements, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest or terminate their commitments, if any, to make further extensions of credit.\nOur obligations and those of the guarantors under our revolving credit facility are secured by certain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets. If we are unable to pay our obligations to the lenders under our revolving credit facility or owed to any holders of future secured debt, they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them. The collateral under our revolving credit facility consists of substantially all of our existing assets. In addition, an acceleration of our obligations under the revolving credit facility or other debt could cause a default under the Senior Notes. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make accelerated payments, including payments on the Senior Notes, or to repay the Senior Notes in full after we pay our secured lenders.\nVolatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates as it matures.\nIn the future, a significant portion of our debt may need to be refinanced. Access to capital markets for longer-term financing is dependent upon many factors outside of our control. Obtaining new financing arrangements or amending our existing ones may result in significantly higher fees and ongoing interest costs.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits from our 2015 Restructuring Plan.\nIn January 2015, we announced our 2015 Restructuring Plan involving the Company\u2019s core feature animation business intended to maximize our creative talent and resources, reduce costs and improve profitability. As a result, we recorded charges totaling approximately $210.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, including approximately $43.4 million relating to employee termination costs and approximately $155.5 million of film and other inventory write-downs. Since the plans and actions we take in connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan are multi-faceted and complex, and involve uncertainty in timing and execution, unforeseen factors could cause expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2007 through 2009. Our California state tax returns for years subsequent to 2009 are open to audit. The Company\u2019s India subsidiary's income tax returns are currently under examination for the tax years ended March 31, 2011 through 2013. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. While we believe that we have adequately provided for our tax liabilities, including the outcome of these examinations, it is possible that the amount paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amount provided. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are the subject of an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management's focus, result in substantial investigation expenses, monetary fines and other possible remedies and have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial condition and results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the Company learned that the Division of Enforcement of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") was conducting an investigation into the writedown of film inventory relating to Turbo and related matters. As a result, we may incur significant legal and accounting expenditures. The Company is unable to estimate with confidence or certainty how long the SEC process will last or its ultimate outcome, including whether the Company will reach a settlement with the SEC and, if so, the amount of any related monetary fine and other possible remedies. Publicity surrounding the foregoing, or any SEC enforcement action or settlement as a result of the SEC's investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 90374, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "DWA"}
