Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated. Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks relating to our business generally\nOur business is cyclical and future periods of decline and recovery are not predictable.\nThe electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time. We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future. Market conditions, such as a decline in product demand on a global basis, could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations. These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products. Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.\nTo remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs. In 2013 and 2015, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance. The programs primarily focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses company-wide, and improving the performance of certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors & Inductors segments. We incur accelerated depreciation expenses related to assets that will no longer be used after the associated restructuring programs are implemented. The expenses associated with the programs have been and will continue to be recorded as they become recognizable under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of 2017.\nAdditionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred. For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.\nOur business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products. If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share. These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.\nOur long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions. Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates. We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions. Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.\nTo remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.\nOur future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us. There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace. Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.\nCertain acquisitions will increase the risks inherent in our business.\nOur acquisition of Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. is unique compared to our past acquisitions. Most of our previous acquisitions were established businesses with substantial tangible assets. As a fabless design business, most of the assets acquired in the Capella transaction were intangible. The Capella business has not performed as expected. As a result, it was determined in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 that the depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets of Capella were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down the related assets to their fair value. If the acquired business continues to not perform as expected, we may be required to record further impairment charges related to those intangible assets, with limited ability to monetize any of those assets. There are significant risks specific to the acquired business that could result in it continuing to not perform as expected.\nAs a fabless design business, Capella is substantially dependent on independent third-party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture its products. If Capella cannot obtain sufficient capacity commitments, if Capella's foundries and subcontractors suffer financial instability, liquidity issues, or insolvency proceedings affecting their ability to manufacture our products, or if Capella's foundries and subcontractors experience production delays for other reasons, the supply of its products could be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business. If demand for its products increases significantly, we have no assurances that Capella's third-party foundries and subcontractors will be able to increase their manufacturing capacity to a level that meets our requirements, potentially preventing us from meeting our customer demand and harming our business and customer relationships. Also, even if Capella's foundries and subcontractors are able to meet our increased demand, those third-party manufacturers may decide to charge significantly higher wafer prices to us, which could reduce our gross margin or require us to offset the increased costs by increasing prices to our customers, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nCapella's future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. We could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified personnel. Should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project's completion during the course of a particular project, the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCapella's historical customer base is concentrated among a few key customers, and is focused on end-users in the consumer products industry. The delay, significant reduction in, or loss of, orders from these large customers or the consumer products industry, or demands of price concessions from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations, or could result in significant volatility in our results of operations.\nSignificant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances. Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR. A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense. A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances. However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.\nOur debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.\nThe recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $437 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock. The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.\nFuture acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.\nIf we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt. This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria. Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios. We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.\nOur existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.\nOur existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments. Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios. If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable. Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.\nOur results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.\nMany of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials. The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny. For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used. For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products. While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us. We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products. To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.\nWe may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.\nOur business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products. During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand. Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities. If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share. These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.\nOur ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.\nProtection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However, our applications may not result in issued patents. Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents. Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.\nLitigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector. We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others. In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others. Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing. Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms. An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.\nOur business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers. We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price. The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.\nOur customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms. This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation.\nMany of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty. Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply. They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the recent period of economic slowdown. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.\nFuture changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.\nOur operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities. Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities. We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites. Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.\nOur products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments. By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.\nWe sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments. Many of these products are used in military applications. Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption. The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.\nWe have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications. These products are assigned certain classification levels. In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies. If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level. A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.\nRapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis. Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury. The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive. While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.\nThe loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInterruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations. Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data. Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches. We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThird-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result. Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks relating to Vishay's operations outside the United States\nWe are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.\nWe have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 74% of our revenues during 2015 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability. This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest. These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.\nOur business has been in operation in Israel for 45 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations. Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nWe attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.\nHistorically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines. We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs. We do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay. Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases. Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries. From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.\nOur significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia. We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies. Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies. Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another. Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars. This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.\nA change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations. Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.\nApproximately 99% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nWe generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, $1,080.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States. Cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs. Except as described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely. If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks related to our capital structure\nThe holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.\nWe have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held. At December 31, 2015, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.2% of the voting power of Vishay. The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders. As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock and 42.3% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2015.\nWe have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.\nOur staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.\nOur reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.\nOur overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt. We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock. Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above. If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders. Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.\nOur outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments. Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument. The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes. The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.\nRisks related to the spin-off of the Vishay Precision Group\nVishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name.\nVPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the \"Vishay\" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses. The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years. Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the \"Vishay\" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.\nGeneral Economic and Business Risks\nIn addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. These factors include:\n\u00b7 overall economic and business conditions;\n\u00b7 competitive factors in the industries in which we conduct our business;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulation;\n\u00b7 changes in tax requirements, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, and revised tax law interpretations;\n\u00b7 changes in GAAP or interpretations of GAAP by governmental agencies and self-regulatory groups;\n\u00b7 interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency rate fluctuations, and other capital market conditions; and\n\u00b7 economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.\nOur common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume. We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.\nWe operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time. Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 57808, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "VSH"}
