{"cik": "1754170", "company": "Monocle Acquisition Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOwnership of our securities involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. Stockholders should review closely the risk factors included in the proxy statement/prospectus that forms a part of the S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with the special meeting of stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement and the proposed Business Combination.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating results to date. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nThe financial statements included in this report do not take into account the consequences of a failure to complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report).\nThe financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we are required to complete a business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021 if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report). The possibility of our initial business combination not being consummated raises some doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern and the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nPast performance by our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in our company.\nInformation regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, our management team and their affiliates is presented for informational purposes only. Past performance by our management team is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team\u2019s or their affiliates\u2019 performance as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the company or the returns the company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. None of our officers or directors has had experience with any blank check companies in the past.\nThe requirement that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (less any taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete such a business combination with.\nPursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. This restriction may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete an initial business combination with. If we are unable to locate a target business or businesses that satisfy this fair market value test, we may be forced to liquidate and our public stockholders will only be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may consummate our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.\nWe may not hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange rules or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting, but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination. However, except as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock do not approve of the business combination we consummate. Our founders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our founders, executive officers and directors have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\nUnlike many other blank check companies in which the founders, executive officers and directors agree to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination, our founders, executive officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree), pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, to vote any common stock held by them in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to the founder shares held by our founders, executive officers and directors, and shares of common stock included in the private units sold to our founders in the private placement in connection with our initial public offering, we would need 6,110,001, or approximately 35.4%, of the 17,250,000 public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted) in order to have such initial business combination approved. We expect that our founders, executive officers and directors, and their permitted transferees, will own approximately 22.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of any such stockholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if such persons agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\nYou may not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more target businesses. Because our board of directors may consummate our initial business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into our initial business combination with a target.\nWe may enter into a transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we may not be able to meet such closing condition, and as a result, would not be able to proceed with such business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to provide all of our public stockholders with an opportunity to redeem all of their shares in connection with the consummation of any initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination, or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets would be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into our initial business combination transaction with us.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIn connection with the successful consummation of our initial business combination, we may redeem up to that number of shares of common stock that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If our initial business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, the redemption threshold may be further limited. Alternatively, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination in case a larger percentage of stockholders exercise their redemption rights than we expect. If the acquisition involves the issuance of our shares as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our shares to the target or its stockholders to make up for the failure to satisfy a minimum cash requirement. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us.\nThe requirement that we maintain a minimum net worth or retain a certain amount of cash could increase the probability that our business combination would be unsuccessful and that our public stockholders would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem their shares.\nIf, pursuant to the terms of our proposed business combination, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth or retain a certain amount of cash in trust in order to consummate the business combination and regardless of whether we proceed with redemptions under the tender or proxy rules, the probability that our business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our business combination is unsuccessful, our public stockholders would not receive their pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate. If our public stockholders are in need of immediate liquidity, they could attempt to sell their shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in our trust account. In either situation, our public stockholders may suffer a material loss on their investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or they are able to sell their shares in the open market.\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating our initial business combination and may limit the amount of time we have to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to consummate our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning our initial business combination will be aware that we must consummate our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable). Consequently, such target businesses may obtain leverage over us in negotiating our initial business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\nWe may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nOur founders, executive officers and directors have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report). We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein.\nIf we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the require time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), pro rata to our public stockholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. This redemption of public stockholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and prior to any voluntary winding up.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination pursuant to a proxy solicitation, our founders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares from stockholders, in which case they may influence a vote in favor of a proposed business combination that you do not support.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination pursuant to a proxy solicitation (meaning we would not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules), our founders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates are permitted to purchase shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Any such purchase would be required to include a contractual acknowledgement that the selling stockholder, although he may still be the record holder of the shares being sold, would, upon consummation of such sale, no longer be the beneficial owner of such shares and would agree not to exercise the redemption rights applicable to such shares. In the event that our founders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates purchase shares of common stock in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, any such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares of common stock prior to the consummation of the transaction.\nThe purpose of such purchases could be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or (2) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.\nPurchases of shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions by our founders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may make it difficult for us to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq following the consummation of an initial business combination.\nIf our founders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our common stock and the number of beneficial holders of our securities would both be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq following consummation of the initial business combination.\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your securities, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of a redemption to public stockholders prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination or our liquidation, (ii) if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or, (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to our pre-business combination activity and related stockholders\u2019 rights. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to the funds in the trust account. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your securities, potentially at a loss.\nOur security holders are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nWe may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, since we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the consummation of our initial public offering and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, our security holders are not afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units were immediately tradable upon consummation of our initial public offering and we have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, offerings subject to Rule 419 would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our consummation of an initial business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination pursuant to a proxy solicitation (meaning we would not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules), and if you or a \u201cgroup\u201d of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination pursuant to a proxy solicitation (meaning we would not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), would be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to an aggregate of more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering without our prior written consent. Your inability to redeem an aggregate of more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering will reduce your influence over our ability to consummate our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell such excess shares in open market transactions. As a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, you would be required to sell your shares in open market transaction, potentially at a loss.\nIf the funds not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report), we may be unable to complete our initial business combination.\nThe funds available to us outside of the trust account, plus the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be available to us, may not be sufficient to allow us to operate until November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report), assuming that our initial business combination is not consummated during that time. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from \u201cshopping\u201d around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we are unable to fund such down payments or \u201cno shop\u201d provisions, our ability to close a contemplated transaction could be impaired. Furthermore, if we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into additional units of the post-business combination entity at a price of\u2009$10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private units. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share or potentially less than $10.10 per share on our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nSubsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, or we may be subject to restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nEven if we conduct thorough due diligence on a target business with which we combine, this diligence may not surface all material issues that may be present with a particular target business. Factors outside of the target business and outside of our control may, at any time, arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.10 per share.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Our independent registered public accounting firm and the underwriters of our initial public offering did not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account.\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.10 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors.\nOur sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.10 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce indemnification obligations against our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine on our behalf whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations on our behalf, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.10 per share.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any funds in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever.\nAccordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if\u2009(i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including restrictions on the nature of our investments and restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including registration as an investment company with the SEC, adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIf we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application also may change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nWe must complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021 if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report). We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within such time period or we may be unable to consummate a business combination due to a downturn in industry or economic conditions or due to other factors that may occur. If we have not completed our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of\u2009 (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will continue in existence only until November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021 if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report). As promptly as reasonably possible following the redemptions we are required to make to our public stockholders in such event, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, we would dissolve and liquidate, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nThe grant of registration rights to our founders, executive officers and directors may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to an agreement entered into on February 6, 2019, our founders, executive officers and directors, and their respective permitted transferees, can demand that we register for resale an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares and 717,500 private units and underlying securities.\nWe will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our founders, executive officers, and directors, or their respective permitted transferees, are registered for resale.\nBecause we are not limited to any specific geographic location or any specific target business, industry or sector with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019 operations.\nAlthough we have initially focused on the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications sectors, we may pursue acquisition opportunities in any geographic region and in any business industry or sector. Except for the limitations that a target business has a fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on interest earned) and that we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we consummate our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. An investment in our securities may not ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in an acquisition target.\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities outside the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications sectors, which may be outside of our management\u2019s areas of expertise.\nWe will consider a business combination outside the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications sectors, which may be outside of our management\u2019s areas of expertise, if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained elsewhere in this report regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors relevant to such acquisition. Accordingly, any stockholder who chooses to remain a stockholder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nAlthough we identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we consummate our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria or guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce our initial business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or the rules of Nasdaq, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share or potentially less than $10.10 per share on our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nManagement\u2019s flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate, along with our management\u2019s financial interest in consummating our initial business combination, may lead management to enter into an acquisition agreement that is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nSubject to the Nasdaq listing rules requirement that our initial business combination occur with one or more target businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. Investors will be relying on management\u2019s ability to identify business combinations, evaluate their merits, conduct or monitor diligence and conduct negotiations. Management\u2019s flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate, along with management\u2019s financial interest in consummating our initial business combination, may lead management to enter into an acquisition agreement that is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings.\nTo the extent we complete our initial business combination with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, and consequently, an independent source may not confirm that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.\nUnless we consummate our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Our board of directors will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target acquisition. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan upon or after consummation of our initial business combination, which would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan upon or after consummation of our initial business combination. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not issue any additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the trust account or vote as a class with our public shares on an initial business combination. Although no such issuance will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account, the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\u00b7 may significantly dilute the equity interest of our current security holders, who will not have pre-emption rights in respect of such an issuance;\n\u00b7 may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if one or more classes of preferred stock are created, and such preferred shares are issued, with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock;\n\u00b7 could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u00b7 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, common stock and/or warrants.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete our initial business combination, which may adversely affect our financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us.\nWe may choose to incur substantial debt to complete the initial business combination. Furthermore, we may issue a substantial number of additional common or preferred shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan upon or after consummation of our initial business combination. We and our officers and directors have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u00b7 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u00b7 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u00b7 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n\u00b7 our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\n\u00b7 our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u00b7 using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nThe investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments requires substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share or potentially less than $10.10 per share on our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of, and issue new series of, preferred stock, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to (i) suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, (ii) any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, (iii) any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (iv) any claim which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (v) any claim for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe do not currently intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after our consummation of a business combination and you will not be entitled to any of the corporate protections provided by such a meeting.\nWe do not currently intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate a business combination (unless required by Nasdaq), and thus may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors, in accordance with a company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. If our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our consummation of a business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on stockholders.\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a stockholder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the stockholder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to stockholders to pay such taxes. Stockholders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be largely dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers, directors and key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of our executive officers, directors, or key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. Additionally, we do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.\nThe role of such key persons in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of such persons may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019 management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted.\nThe officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon consummation of our initial business combination. The loss of an acquisition target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nThe role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the consummation of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that some members of the management team of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.\nNone of Cowen, any of its affiliates or our advisors has an obligation to provide us with potential investment opportunities or to devote any specified amount of time or support to our company\u2019s business.\nAlthough we expect to benefit from Cowen\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 network of relationships and processes for sourcing, executing and evaluating potential acquisition targets, neither Cowen nor any of its affiliates has any legal or contractual obligation to seek on our behalf or to present to us investment opportunities that might be suitable for our business, and may allocate any such opportunities at its discretion to us or other parties. We have no investment management, advisory, consulting or other agreement in place with Cowen or any of its affiliates that obligates them to undertake efforts on our behalf or that govern the manner in which they will allocate investment opportunities. Even if Cowen, one of its affiliates or one of our advisors refers an opportunity to us, no assurance can be given that such opportunity will result in an acquisition agreement or our initial business combination.\nCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nFollowing the completion of our initial public offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we have engaged and will continue to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our officers and directors are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business.\nOur officers also may become aware of business opportunities, which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary duties or contractual obligations. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor or that a potential target business would not be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us.\nWe may engage in our initial business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our founders, executive officers or directors, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. Additionally, in light of the involvement of our founders, executive officers and directors, and each of their affiliates, with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our founders, executive officers or directors, or any of their affiliates. Our directors also serve as executive officers and board members for other entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for our initial business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent account firm regarding the fairness to our stockholders from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our founders, executive officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. Our directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of our stockholders, whether or not a conflict of interest may exist.\nSince each of our founders, executive officers and directors will lose any investment in us if our initial business combination is not consummated, and our officers and directors have significant financial interests in us, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular acquisition target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nIn September 2018, our founders purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of\u2009$25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. Certain members of our management team also have a financial interest in our sponsor. In November 2018, our sponsor transferred 15,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors. On November 19, 2018, our founders forfeited for no consideration, an aggregate of 1,437,500 founder shares, such that the initial stockholders hold an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. In addition, simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, our sponsor and/or its designees purchased 591,334 private units for an aggregate purchase price of\u2009$5,913,340, and Cowen Investments and/or its designees purchased 126,166 private units for an aggregate purchase price of\u2009$1,261,660. All of the foregoing private units will also be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our founders, executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business, which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities, which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u00b7 solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or\n\u00b7 dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\nWe may attempt to simultaneously consummate business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to consummate our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nWe may attempt to consummate our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in our initial business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information typically exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in our initial business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nOur management team and our stockholders may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination.\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that we merge directly with the target business or businesses or acquire less than 100% of their interests or assets in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or targets, or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business or businesses sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us, respectively, in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that we will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.\nUnlike many blank check companies, we do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.\nSince we have no specified percentage threshold for redemption contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our structure is different in this respect from the structure that has been used by many blank check companies. Historically, blank check companies would not be able to consummate an initial business combination if the holders of such company\u2019s public shares voted against a proposed business combination and elected to redeem more than a specified maximum percentage of the shares sold in such company\u2019s initial public offering, which percentage threshold was typically between 19.99% and 39.99%. As a result, many blank check companies were unable to complete a business combination because the amount of shares voted by their public stockholders electing redemption exceeded the maximum redemption threshold pursuant to which such company could proceed with its initial business combination. As a result, we may be able to consummate our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to a tender offer, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to us or our founders, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.\nHolders of warrants will not participate in liquidating distributions if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account, the warrants will expire and holders will not receive any of such proceeds with respect to the warrants. Nevertheless, the foregoing may provide a financial incentive to public stockholders to vote in favor of any proposed initial business combination as each of their warrants would entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock, resulting in an increase in their overall economic stake in our company. If a business combination is not approved, the warrants will expire and will be worthless.\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, public holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d which would result in a fewer number of shares being issued to the holder had such holder exercised the warrants for cash.\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of warrant shares that a holder will receive upon exercise of its public warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised its warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the issuance of the warrant shares is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the warrant shares until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our Company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the warrant shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrants shall not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of common stock included in the units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of the private warrants may pay cash in connection with the exercise of their warrants for unregistered warrant shares even if the prospectus relating to the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not current and effective.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its warrants (including any warrants held by our founders or any of their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of warrant shares received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrants for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into stock or cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\nWe have issued warrants to purchase 17,250,000 shares of our common stock as part of the units offered in our initial public offering and warrants to purchase 717,500 shares of our common stock as part of the private placement. In each case, the warrants are exercisable at a price of\u2009$11.50 per share of common stock. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares of common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise their redemption rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf our initial business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many public stockholders may exercise redemption rights, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such redemption, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our initial business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us.\nWe may be unable to consummate an initial business combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing, in which case public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to receive a pro rata share of the trust account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.\nA potential target may make it a closing condition to our initial business combination that we have a certain amount of cash in excess of the $5,000,001 of net tangible assets we are required to have pursuant to our organizational documents available at the time of closing. If the number of our public stockholders electing to exercise their redemption rights has the effect of reducing the amount of money available to us to consummate an initial business combination below such minimum amount required by the target business and we are not able to locate an alternative source of funding, we will not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. In that case, public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable) in order to be able to receive a portion of the trust account, or attempt to sell their shares in the open market prior to such time, in which case they may receive less than they would have in a liquidation of the trust account.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we intend to offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of the proposed business combination and still seek redemption of such stockholders\u2019 shares.\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve an initial business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our founders, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed for cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this report) without voting and, if they do vote, regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. This is different than other similarly structured blank check companies where stockholders are offered the right to redeem their shares only when they vote against a proposed business combination. This threshold and the ability to seek redemption while voting in favor of a proposed business combination may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination.\nWe will require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nWe may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company\u2019s, or DTC\u2019s, DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Under our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise redemption rights. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their redemption rights and thus may be unable to redeem their shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares, its shares may not be redeemed.\nAdditionally, despite our compliance with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, stockholders may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem their shares.\nStockholders who attempt to redeem their shares may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nWe will require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with any proposed business combination to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for redemption. If such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to redeem their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek redemption may be able to sell their securities.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private equity groups, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, operating businesses and other blank check companies competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval of our initial business combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least 65% of our issued and outstanding common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support.\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company\u2019s pre-business combination activity, without approval by holders of a certain percentage of the company\u2019s shares. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by holders holding between 90% and 100% of the company\u2019s public shares. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that amendments to any of its provisions relating to our pre-initial business combination activity and related stockholder rights, including the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete out initial business combination within the required time period, may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of our outstanding common stock. If an amendment to any such provision is approved by the requisite stockholder vote, then the corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our common stock, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that can vote as a class with our public shares on amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our founders, executive officers and directors collectively beneficially own approximately 22.6% of our outstanding common stock, and they may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete an initial business combination with which you do not agree. In certain circumstances, our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share or potentially less than $10.10 per share on our redemption, and the warrants will expire worthless.\nIf the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, including the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust account that may be available to us for our initial business combination, prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular initial business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share or potentially less than $10.10 per share on our redemption, and the warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to consummate our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\nOur founders, executive officers and directors have a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur founders, executive officers and directors own approximately 22.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. However, our founders, executive officers, directors or any of their affiliates could determine in the future to purchase public units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote or magnitude of the number of stockholders seeking to tender their shares to us. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our founders, as well as all of our executive officers and directors, have agreed to vote their founder shares, the shares of common stock underlying the private units, as well as any shares of common stock acquired in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nIn addition, our board of directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of our initial business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a portion of our board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our business combination.\nA market for our securities may not fully develop or be sustained, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may not fully develop or be sustained. Additionally, if our securities become delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not listed on a national exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were listed on Nasdaq or another national exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be fully developed and sustained.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur units, common stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq. We cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4 per share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our units, common stock and warrants are listed on Nasdaq, our units, common stock and warrants are covered securities under such statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nCertain agreements related to our initial public offering may be amended without stockholder approval.\nCertain agreements, including the underwriting agreement relating to our initial public offering, the trust agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the letter agreements among us and our founders, executive officers and directors, and the registration rights agreement among us and our founders, executive officers and directors, may be amended without stockholder approval. These agreements contain various provisions that our public stockholders might deem to be material. For example, the underwriting agreement related to our initial public offering contains a covenant that the target company that we acquire must have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of signing the definitive agreement for the transaction with such target business (excluding any taxes payable on interest earned) so long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Any such amendment may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\nThe United States federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standard as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, as applicable).\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing a business combination.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of any second quarter of a fiscal year before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the end of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nWe may face risks related to businesses in the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications industries.\nBusiness combinations with businesses in the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications industries entail special considerations and risks. If we are successful in completing a business combination with such a target business, we may be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the following risks:\n\u00b7 an inability to compete effectively in a highly competitive environment with many incumbents having substantially greater resources;\n\u00b7 an inability to manage rapid change, increasing consumer expectations and growth;\n\u00b7 an inability to build strong brand identity and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty;\n\u00b7 a reliance on proprietary technology to provide services and to manage our operations, and the failure of this technology to operate effectively, or our failure to use such technology effectively;\n\u00b7 an inability to deal with our customers\u2019 privacy concerns;\n\u00b7 an inability to attract and retain customers;\n\u00b7 an inability to license or enforce intellectual property rights on which our business may depend;\n\u00b7 any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we would utilize in our operations;\n\u00b7 an inability by us, or a refusal by third parties, to license content to us upon acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 potential liability for negligence, copyright, or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we may distribute;\n\u00b7 competition for the discretionary spending of customers, which may intensify in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior;\n\u00b7 disruption or failure of our networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, \u201ccyber-attacks,\u201d misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, accidental releases of information or similar events;\n\u00b7 an inability to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support;\n\u00b7 reliance on third-party vendors or service providers;\n\u00b7 our business may be subject to extensive government regulations which may be difficult and expensive to comply with, including extensive procurement regulations applicable to sales to the U.S. government, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs;\n\u00b7 if we contract with the U.S. government, the U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts; and\n\u00b7 U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to the aerospace and defense, industrial, and technology and telecommunications industries. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks we will be subject to risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, which may or may not be different than those risks listed above.\nRisks Associated with the Proposed Business Combination\nReferences in this section to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cMonocle\u201d refer to Monocle Acquisition Corporation, references in this section to \u201cNewCo\u201d refer to Monocle Holdings Inc., references in this section to \u201cAerSale\u201d refer to AerSale Corp. and references in this section to the \u201ccombined company\u201d and \u201cpost-combination company\u201d refer to NewCo and its subsidiaries, including Monocle and AerSale, following the consummation of the proposed Business Combination. Stockholders should review closely the risk factors included in the proxy statement/prospectus that forms a part of the S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with the special meeting of stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement and the proposed Business Combination.\nAlthough NewCo expects to file an application to list its securities on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that its securities will be so listed or, if listed, that NewCo will be able to comply with the continued listing standards.\nNewCo expects to file a new listing application to list NewCo Common Stock on Nasdaq upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination in accordance with the requirements of the exchange. As part of the listing process, NewCo will be required to provide evidence that it is able to meet the initial listing requirements. There can be no assurance that NewCo will be able to meet the initial listing standards of Nasdaq or any other exchange or, if its securities are listed, that NewCo will be able to maintain such listing.\nIn addition, if after listing, Nasdaq delists NewCo\u2019s securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the continued listing standards, NewCo and its securityholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that its common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in its common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for its common stock; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThere has been no prior public market for NewCo Common Stock and a market may never develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of NewCo Common Stock.\nThe NewCo Common Stock is a new issue of securities for which there is no established public market. NewCo intends to apply to list the NewCo Common Stock on Nasdaq. However, an active public market for the NewCo Common Stock may not develop or be sustained after the consummation of the proposed Business Combination, which could affect the ability to sell, or depress the market price of, the NewCo Common Stock. We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid that market might become.\nIn addition, the price of NewCo securities after the proposed Business Combination can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nWe are not required to obtain, and have not obtained, an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the terms of the proposed Business Combination are fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Our board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with their determination to approve the proposed Business Combination. In analyzing the proposed Business Combination, our board of directors and management team conducted due diligence on AerSale and researched the industry in which AerSale operates and concluded that the proposed Business Combination was in the best interest of our stockholders. Accordingly, our stockholders will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in determining the value of the proposed Business Combination, and our board of directors may not have properly valued such business. The lack of third-party valuation or a fairness opinion may also lead an increased number of stockholders to vote against the proposed Business Combination or demand redemption of their shares, which could potentially impact our ability to consummate the proposed Business Combination.\nIf immediately prior to Closing, the Available Cash Shortfall Amount is greater than $50 million, closing conditions to the Merger Agreement will not be satisfied and either Monocle or AerSale may terminate the Merger Agreement.\nIf the Available Cash Shortfall Amount is greater than $50 million, then a condition on both of the parties\u2019 obligations to close the proposed Business Combination shall not be satisfied and either Monocle or AerSale can terminate the Merger Agreement under its terms by written notice to the other party. The Available Cash Shortfall Amount may be greater than $50 million if, among other reasons, the holders of greater than 5,311,523 shares of our common stock elect to redeem their shares, unless additional financing is secured.\nCowen may have had a conflict of interest in rendering services to our company in connection with the proposed Business Combination.\nWe engaged Cowen to provide services to us in connection with our initial business combination, such as holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss the proposed Business Combination and the target business\u2019s attributes, introducing us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with the proposed Business Combination, assisting us in obtaining stockholder approval for the proposed Business Combination and assisting us with our press releases and public filings in connection with the proposed Business Combination. We are obligated to pay Cowen a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of the proposed Business Combination in an amount equal to $6,037,500. In the event we do not consummate a business combination and are forced to liquidate, Cowen will not receive this fee. Additionally, Cowen holds 269,531 founder shares which will be worthless if we do not consummate our business combination prior to November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report). As a result, these financial interests may have resulted in Cowen having a conflict of interest in providing the services to us in connection with the proposed Business Combination.\nThe expiration date of Wells Fargo and PNC\u2019s commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter is earlier than the termination date under the Merger Agreement. In the event that we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination prior to expiration of the Debt Commitment Letter, we may be obligated to enter into alternative financing arrangements on less favorable terms or be unable to consummate the proposed Business Combination.\nEither Monocle or AerSale can terminate the Merger Agreement under its terms by written notice to the other party if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 31, 2020. Under the Debt Commitment Letter, however, the commitments by Wells Fargo and PNC to fund the ABL Facility shall automatically expire on May 31, 2020 if the conditions to the initial funding of the ABL Facility are not then satisfied. In the event that the proposed Business Combination is not completed by May 31, 2020, we will be unable to complete the proposed Business Combination unless either (a) Wells Fargo and PNC agree to extend the expiration date of their commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or (b) we arrange alternative financing, which may be on less favorable terms than that of the Debt Commitment Letter. There is no guarantee that Wells and PNC will extend or that we will be able to arrange alternative financing at terms that are the same or similar to the current terms of the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter.\nEven if we consummate the proposed Business Combination, there is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of our warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per share of our common stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nOur ability to successfully effect the proposed Business Combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, including the key personnel of AerSale, whom we expect to stay with the post-combination company following the proposed Business Combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business and its financial condition could suffer as a result.\nOur ability to successfully effect our proposed Business Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, including the key personnel of AerSale. Although certain of our key personnel may remain with the post-combination company in senior management or advisory positions following our proposed Business Combination, it is possible that we will lose certain key personnel, the loss of whom could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. We anticipate that some or all of the AerSale management will remain in place.\nAerSale\u2019s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management, certain of whom would be difficult to replace. Departure by certain of AerSale\u2019s officers could have a material adverse effect on AerSale\u2019s business, financial condition, or operating results. AerSale does not maintain key-man life insurance on any of its officers. The services of such personnel may not continue to be available to AerSale.\nOur company and AerSale will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed Business Combination is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the proposed Business Combination on employees and third parties may have an adverse effect on our company and AerSale. These uncertainties may impair our or AerSale\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties that deal with any of us or them to defer entering into contracts or making other decisions or seek to change existing business relationships. If key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the proposed Business Combination, our or AerSale\u2019s business could be harmed.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the proposed Business Combination.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the proposed Business Combination, to the extent permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition to our obligations to close the proposed Business Combination that there be no breach of AerSale\u2019s representations and warranties as of the Closing Date. However, if our board of directors determines that any such breach is not material to the business of AerSale, then our board of directors may elect to waive that condition and close the proposed Business Combination. We are not able to waive the condition that our stockholders approve the proposed Business Combination.\nThe exercise of our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the proposed Business Combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the proposed Business Combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nIn the period leading up to the Closing Date of the proposed Business Combination, events may occur that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, would require us to amend the Merger Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by the other parties to the Merger Agreement or to waive rights to which our company is entitled under the Merger Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of AerSale\u2019s business, a request by a party to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Merger Agreement or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on AerSale\u2019s business and would entitle us to terminate the Merger Agreement. In any of such circumstances, it would be at our discretion, acting through our board of directors, to grant our consent or waive our rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of our directors described elsewhere in this report may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what he may believe is best for our company and our stockholders and what he may believe is best for himself or his affiliates in determining whether or not to take the requested action. As of the date of this report, we do not believe there will be any changes or waivers that our directors and officers would be likely to make after stockholder approval of the proposed Business Combination has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further stockholder approval, if there is a change to the terms of the transaction that would have a material impact on the stockholders, we will be required to circulate a new or amended proxy statement or supplement thereto and resolicit the vote of our stockholders.\nWe will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the proposed Business Combination.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue incurring significant costs in connection with consummating the proposed Business Combination and operating as a public company following the consummation of the proposed Business Combination. We may incur additional costs to retain key employees. All expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the proposed Business Combination, including all legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be paid by NewCo.\nThe transaction expenses as a result of the proposed Business Combination are currently estimated at approximately $25 million.\nSubsequent to our completion of our proposed Business Combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence on AerSale, we cannot assure you that this diligence has uncovered all material issues that may be present in AerSale\u2019s business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary due diligence process, or that factors outside of AerSale\u2019s business and outside of our and AerSale\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Additionally, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the post-combination company or its securities. Accordingly, any of our stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our proposed Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u00b7 expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u00b7 tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u00b7 costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u00b7 changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u00b7 lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the proposed Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of NewCo securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the proposed Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of NewCo securities may decline. The market value of NewCo securities at the time of the proposed Business Combination may vary significantly from the prices of Monocle\u2019s securities on the date the Merger Agreement was executed, the date of this report, or the date on which our stockholders vote on the proposed Business Combination.\nIn addition, following the proposed Business Combination, fluctuations in the price of NewCo securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Immediately prior to the proposed Business Combination, there has not been a public market for NewCo or AerSale\u2019s stock and trading in the shares of our common stock has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to AerSale Common Stock and our common stock in the proposed Business Combination may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the proposed Business Combination. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of NewCo securities following the proposed Business Combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, certain of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and NewCo securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of NewCo\u2019s securities following the proposed Business Combination may include:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7 success of competitors;\n\u00b7 our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the post-combination company or the market in general;\n\u00b7 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the post-combination company;\n\u00b7 our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u00b7 commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the post-combination company;\n\u00b7 changes in the post-combination company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7 the volume of shares of NewCo Common Stock available for public sale;\n\u00b7 any major change in the NewCo board of directors or management;\n\u00b7 sales of substantial amounts of NewCo Common Stock by our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u00b7 general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the post-combination company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nFuture sales of NewCo Common Stock may cause the market price of its securities to drop significantly, even if its business is performing well.\nOur initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and private units in connection with (a) the consummation of the proposed Business Combination or (b) the liquidation of our trust account if we fail to complete our proposed Business Combination by November 11, 2020 (or February 11, 2021, if we extend our time to complete a business combination as described elsewhere in this report) (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold).\nThe initial stockholders have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until one year after the completion of the proposed Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) if the reported last sale price of the NewCo Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the proposed Business Combination, or (2) if we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after the proposed Business Combination which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property, then such securities will be released from these restrictions.\nEach AerSale stockholder has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (among other restrictions) any Lock-Up Shares for a period commencing from the Closing and ending on the earliest of: (a) the 180th day after the Closing Date, (b) the expiration of the lock-up period previously agreed to by our sponsor and certain other parties and (c) the date following such Closing Date on which NewCo completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of NewCo\u2019s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of NewCo Common Stock for cash, securities or other property.\nIn addition, the AerSale stockholders and the initial stockholders will be entitled to registration rights, subject to certain limitations, with respect to NewCo Common Stock they receive in the proposed Business Combination pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into in connection with the consummation of the proposed Business Combination. In addition, these stockholders will have certain demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights following the consummation of the proposed Business Combination. NewCo will bear certain expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of such rights. The presence of these additional securities trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of NewCo Common Stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. After the proposed Business Combination, our initial stockholders are expected to hold between 10.4% (assuming no redemptions) and 12.2% (assuming redemptions of 30.8% of public shares, which is the maximum number of shares redeemable that would permit the closing condition in the Merger Agreement related to the Available Cash Shortfall Amount to be satisfied, after taking into account the issuance of 500,000 shares of NewCo Convertible Preferred Stock) of NewCo Common Stock, in each case not including the Unvested Founder Shares (which are issued but subject to vesting under the Founder Shares Agreement). The initial stockholders have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until one year after the completion of the proposed Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) if the reported last sale price of the NewCo Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the proposed Business Combination, or (2) if we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after the proposed Business Combination which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property, then such securities will be released from these restrictions.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u00b7 labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u00b7 profitability of our products, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates;\n\u00b7 impairment of long-lived assets;\n\u00b7 macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u00b7 negative publicity relating to products we serve;\n\u00b7 changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7 expansion to new markets; and\n\u00b7 fluctuations in commodity prices.\nIf, following the proposed Business Combination, securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the post-combination company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding NewCo Common Stock adversely, then the price and trading volume of NewCo Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for NewCo Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on Monocle or the post-combination company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the post-combination company, NewCo\u2019s stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the post-combination company change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of NewCo Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the post-combination company were to cease coverage of the post-combination company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause NewCo\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline.\nEach of our warrants will be converted into and become the right to receive a NewCo warrant exercisable for one share of NewCo Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to NewCo\u2019s stockholders.\nWe issued 17,250,000 public warrants as part of our initial public offering and warrants to purchase 717,500 shares of our common stock as part of the private placement. Each warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. In addition, prior to consummating an initial business combination, nothing prevents us from issuing additional securities in a private placement so long as they do not participate in any manner in the trust account or vote as a class with our common stock on a business combination. In connection with the proposed Business Combination, our warrants will be converted into and become NewCo Warrants. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of NewCo Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of NewCo Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of NewCo Common Stock.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of\u2009 $0.01 per warrant, upon a minimum of 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of redemption; provided that the last reported sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption rights provided that there is an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of NewCo Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the NewCo warrants, a current prospectus relating thereto, and we have provided notice to the holder not less than 30 days prior to the redemption date. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force the warrant holders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants. None of the private warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our founders or their permitted transferees.\nNewCo will be a holding company with no business operations of its own and will depend on cash flow from AerSale to meet its obligations.\nFollowing the proposed Business Combination, NewCo will be a holding company with no business operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of its operations will be conducted by its subsidiary, AerSale, and its subsidiaries. As a holding company, NewCo will require dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. The terms of any credit facility may restrict NewCo\u2019s subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to it. If there is an insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of NewCo\u2019s subsidiaries, NewCo\u2019s stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against their assets. Creditors of those subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of those subsidiaries before NewCo, as an equityholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal. If AerSale is unable to pay dividends or make other payments to NewCo when needed, NewCo will be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in NewCo\u2019s certificate of incorporation and proposed bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation of NewCo, or the NewCo Charter, contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the NewCo board of directors to designate the terms of, and issue new series of, preferred stock, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. There provisions will include:\n\u00b7 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 the right of the NewCo board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the NewCo board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the NewCo board of directors;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of the NewCo board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors.\nThe NewCo Charter will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by NewCo stockholders, which could limit NewCo\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with NewCo or its directors, officers or employees.\nThe NewCo Charter, like Monocle\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, derivative actions brought in NewCo\u2019s name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to (i) suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, (ii) any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, (iii) any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (iv) any claim which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (v) any claim for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, the NewCo Charter will also provide that unless it consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of NewCo capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the forum provisions in its amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with NewCo or any of its directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although NewCo\u2019s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the NewCo Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, it may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. federal tax treatment of our outstanding warrants, which are currently exercisable for one share of our common stock and will be converted into and become the right to receive a NewCo warrant exercisable for one share of NewCo Common Stock following the proposed Business Combination, is unclear and, as a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of such warrants are also unclear.\nOur outstanding warrants are currently exercisable for one share each of our common stock and will be converted into and become the right to receive NewCo warrants that will be exercisable for one share each of NewCo Common Stock following the proposed Business Combination. We intend to treat the warrants as exchanged in the First Merger, which we intend to treat as a tax-deferred transaction under Section 368 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not successfully challenge this position, arguing instead that the First Merger did not qualify for deferral under Section 368 of the Code. In such case, a stockholder holding our warrants would be required to recognize gain, but not loss, as a result of the exchange equal to the lesser of\u2009(i) such stockholder\u2019s \u201crealized gain\u201d from the exchange (generally the excess of the sum of the fair market value of the NewCo Common Stock and NewCo warrants received over such stockholder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in the shares of our common stock and warrants exchanged), and (ii) the fair market value of the NewCo warrants received.\nThere is no guarantee that a stockholder\u2019s decision whether to redeem its shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account will put the stockholder in a better future economic position.\nWe can give no assurance as to the price at which a stockholder may be able to sell its public shares in the future following the completion of the proposed Business Combination or any alternative business combination. Certain events following the consummation of any initial business combination, including the proposed Business Combination, may cause an increase in our share price, and may result in a lower value realized now than a stockholder might realize in the future had the stockholder not redeemed its shares. Similarly, if a stockholder does not redeem its shares, the stockholder will bear the risk of ownership of the public shares after the consummation of any initial business combination, and there can be no assurance that a stockholder can sell its shares in the future for a greater amount than the redemption price. A stockholder should consult the stockholder\u2019s own tax and/or financial advisor for assistance on how this may affect his, her or its individual situation.\nIf a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our proposed Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nIf, despite our compliance with the proxy rules, a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy materials that we are furnishing to holders of our public shares in connection with our proposed Business Combination describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem public shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed.", "PERMNO": 18410, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "MNCL"}
