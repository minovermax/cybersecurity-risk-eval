{"cik": "43350", "company": "Gas Natural Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n(dollars in thousands)\nAn investment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should give careful consideration to the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report. The following risk factors, however, may not reflect all of the risks associated with our business or an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies that impact the rates we are able to charge, our costs and profitability.\nThe FERC and public utility commissions in states where we operate regulate many aspects of our distribution and transmission operations. State regulatory agencies set the rates that we may charge customers, which effectively limits the rate of return we are permitted to realize. Our ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return and/or recover costs depends upon regulatory discretion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue to receive the current authorized rates of return, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. The state utility regulatory agencies also regulate our public utilities\u2019 gas purchases, construction and maintenance of facilities, the terms of service to our customers, safety and various other aspects of our distribution operations. The FERC regulates interstate transportation and storage of natural gas. To the extent that our utilities have contracts for transportation and storage services under FERC-approved tariffs with interstate pipelines, our utilities are subject to FERC rules and regulations pertaining to those services. If we fail to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, we may be subject to fines or penalties.\nOur gas purchase practices are subject to annual reviews by state regulatory agencies that could impact our earnings and cash flow.\nThe regulatory agencies that oversee our utility operations retrospectively review our purchases of natural gas on an annual basis. The purpose of these annual reviews is to reconcile the differences, if any, between the amount we paid for natural gas and the amount our customers paid for natural gas. If any costs are disallowed in this review process, these disallowed costs would be expensed in the cost of gas but would not be recoverable in the rates charged to our customers. Significant disallowances would affect our earnings and cash flow.\nThe PUCO examined NEO and Orwell under the GCR mechanism. NEO\u2019s audit covered the GCR mechanism from September 2009 through February 2012, and Orwell\u2019s GCR mechanism covered the period of July 2010 through June 2012. On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an Opinion and Order in these GCR cases that disallowed our recovery of $1,027, primarily fees paid to JDOG Marketing, and fines of $76. In addition, the order called for an investigative and forensic audit of NEO, Orwell and all affiliated and related companies and their internal management controls to be undertaken by an outside auditor. The results of this audit were released on January 23, 2015. The report made various recommendations, primarily regarding our Ohio GCR filings, business structure, and internal controls. On October 30, 2015, the PUCO staff entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation with Brainard, NEO and Orwell. The Stipulation and Recommendation outlines various terms and conditions, primarily regarding the maintenance and implementation of additional processes and procedures for the Company\u2019s Ohio GCR filings. On June 1, 2016, the PUCO issued an order adopting the Stipulation.\nWe currently are involved in shareholder derivative lawsuits and other related proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nBeginning on December 10, 2013, five shareholder derivative complaints were filed in federal court against Gas Natural, as a nominal defendant, and against certain of our current and former directors and officers, as actual defendants. We may also be subject to additional lawsuits, investigations or proceedings in the future that relate to the allegations set forth in these derivative actions. On February 6, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated solely for purposes of conducting limited pretrial discovery, and on February 21, 2014, the Court appointed lead counsel for all five lawsuits. The consolidated action contains claims against various current or former directors or officers of Gas Natural alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment arising primarily out of our acquisition of the Ohio utilities, services provided by JDOG Marketing, the acquisition of JDOG Marketing, and the sale of our common stock by Richard M. Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer, and Thomas J. Smith, our former chief financial officer and a former director of ours. The suit seeks the recovery of unspecified damages allegedly sustained by Gas Natural, which is named as a nominal defendant, corporate reforms, disgorgement, restitution, the recovery of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and other relief. On January 13, 2017, we entered into a Stipulation of Settlement that was preliminarily approved by the court on January 31, 2017, which is subject to a settlement hearing and final approval by the court. A more detailed description of these lawsuits and others is contained in the section captioned Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, in this Annual Report.\nWe are a nominal defendant in the pending shareholder derivative suits, and none of the plaintiffs are seeking recovery from Gas Natural. However, we have certain indemnification obligations to the named defendants, including the advancement of defense costs to the individuals. The expenses related to continuing to defend such litigation may be significant.\nWe received a letter from the Chicago Regional Office of the SEC dated March 3, 2015, stating that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation regarding (i) audits by the PUCO and Rehmann Corporate Investigative Services, (ii) the determination and calculation of the GCR, (iii) our financial statements and internal controls and (iv) various entities affiliated with our former chief executive officer, Richard M. Osborne. The SEC has requested we preserve all documents relating to these matters. We received a subpoena to produce documents from the staff of the SEC dated May 29, 2015, in connection with this matter. On March 15, 2016, we received a second subpoena regarding the same case. On January 30, 2017, the SEC\u2019s investigation was closed without a recommendation of an enforcement action.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits and the investigation or for how long they will remain active. Regardless of the outcome, the pending lawsuits, investigation, and any other related litigation, proceedings, or investigations that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors in the future could be time consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees from the operation of our business. Moreover, negative developments with respect to the pending lawsuits and investigation could cause our stock price to decline. We could also be required to pay damages or other monetary penalties imposed on our directors and officers as a result of the foregoing matters. Any expenses, damages or settlement amounts involved in these matters could exceed coverage provided under our applicable insurance policies. Any unfavorable outcome of the pending shareholder cases and investigation could harm our business and financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nOperational issues beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in geographically dispersed areas. Our ability to provide natural gas depends both on our own operations and facilities and those of third parties, including local gas producers and natural gas pipeline operators from whom we receive our natural gas supply. The loss of use or destruction of our facilities or the facilities of third parties due to extreme weather conditions, breakdowns, war, acts of terrorism or other occurrences could greatly reduce potential earnings and cash flows and increase our costs of repairs and replacement of assets. Our losses may not be fully recoverable through insurance or customer rates.\nStoring and transporting natural gas involves inherent risks that could cause us to incur significant financial losses.\nThere are inherent hazards and operational risks in gas distribution activities, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems that could cause the loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and administrative proceedings that could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties against us. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, they could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nOur earnings and cash flow are sensitive to decreases in customer consumption resulting from warmer than normal temperatures and customer conservation.\nOur natural gas sales revenue is generated primarily through the sale and delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial customers who use natural gas mainly for space heating. Given the impact of variable and volatile weather patterns on our utility operations, our business is a seasonal business. In addition, the average annual natural gas consumption of customers has been decreasing because, among other things, new homes and appliances are typically more energy efficient than older homes and appliances, and customers appear to be continuing a pattern of conserving energy by utilizing more energy efficient heating systems, insulation, alternative energy sources, and other energy savings devices and techniques. A mild winter, as well as continued or increased conservation, in any of our service areas can have a significant adverse impact on demand for natural gas and, consequently, our earnings and cash flow.\nThe increased cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly could adversely impact our earnings and cash flow.\nThe rates we are permitted to charge allow us to recover our cost of purchasing natural gas. In general, the various regulatory agencies allow us to recover the costs of natural gas purchased for customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis (in the absence of a finding of imprudence), without a profit component. We periodically adjust customer rates for increases and decreases in the cost of gas purchased by us for sale to our customers. Under the regulatory approved GCR pricing mechanisms, the gas commodity portion of gas rates we charge to our customers may be adjusted upward on a periodic basis. If the cost of purchasing natural gas increases and we are unable to recover these costs from our customers immediately, or at all, we may incur increased costs associated with higher working capital requirements. In addition, any increases in the cost of purchasing natural gas may result in higher uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of customer defaults on payment and reduced sales volume and related margins due to lower customer consumption.\nVolatility in the price of natural gas could result in customers switching to alternative energy sources which could reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nThe market price of alternative energy sources such as coal, electricity, propane, oil and steam is a competitive factor affecting the demand for our gas distribution services. Our customers may have or may acquire the capacity to use one or more of the alternative energy sources if the price of natural gas and our distribution services increase significantly. In 2015 and the beginning of 2016, the United States experienced falling oil prices, lowering the average price of residential heating oil at the beginning of 2016 to some of the lowest levels in more than a decade. Natural gas has typically been less expensive than these alternative energy sources. However, if natural gas prices increase significantly, some of these alternative energy sources may become more economical or more attractive than natural gas, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.\nThe gas industry is intensely competitive and competition has increased in recent years as a result of changes in the price negotiation process within the supply and distribution chain of the gas industry, both of which could negatively impact earnings.\nWe compete with companies from various regions of the United States and may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales. Many of these companies are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources than we do. Additionally, legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state levels, are designed to promote competition. These challenges have been compounded by changes in the gas industry that have allowed certain customers to negotiate gas purchases directly with producers or brokers. We could lose market share or our profit margins may decline in the future if we are unable to remain competitive.\nOur earnings and cash flow may be adversely affected by downturns in the economy.\nOur operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national, regional and local economies, which impact the amount of residential and industrial growth and actual gas consumption in our service territories. Our industrial customers use natural gas in the production of their products. During economic downturns, these customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of natural gas they require for production. During periods of slow or little economic growth, energy conversation efforts often increase and the amount of uncollectible customer accounts increases. In addition, our industrial customers may encounter particularized economic hardships in their industries as a result of stagnant national demand, diminishing utility for their products, bankruptcies, consolidations of operations in response to market weakness, and other structural changes. These factors may reduce our earnings and cash flow.\nChanges in the market price and transportation costs of natural gas could result in financial losses that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of natural gas. We purchase and store gas for distribution later in the year. We enter into agreements to buy or sell physical gas at a fixed price. We also enter into natural gas commodity swap agreements as the fixed price payor. We may use such arrangements to protect profit margins on future obligations to deliver gas at a fixed price. Further, we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by the counterparties to these agreements, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.\nChanges in current regulations, the regulatory environment and events in the energy markets that are beyond our control may reduce our earnings and limit our access to capital markets.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy of some energy companies, downturns in the economy, the volatility of natural gas prices in North America, public debate over climate change and the evolution of alternative energy sources, companies in regulated and unregulated energy businesses have generally been under increased scrutiny by regulators, participants in the capital markets and debt rating agencies. As a result of such disruptions in the market, our cost of borrowing may increase or access to capital markets may be adversely affected. In addition, the FASB or the SEC may enact new accounting standards that could impact the way we are required to record revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. State utility regulatory agencies could also enact more stringent rules or standards with respect to rates, cost recovery, safety, construction, maintenance or other aspects of our operations. Further, federal, state, and local governing bodies could revise or reinterpret current laws and regulations or make changes in enforcement practices. We cannot predict or control what effect proposed regulations, events in the energy markets or other future actions of governing bodies, regulatory agencies or others in response to such events may have on our earnings or access to the capital markets.\nWe acquired interests in our natural gas wells by quitclaim deed and cannot guarantee that we hold clear title to our interests or that our interests will not be challenged in the future.\nWe have an ownership interest in 160 natural gas producing wells in Montana, which provide our marketing and production operations a partial natural hedge when market prices of natural gas are greater than the cost of production. The gas production from these wells provided approximately 7.3% of the volume requirements for EWR\u2019s Montana market for 2016. We acquired our interests in the wells in 2002 and 2003 by quitclaim deed conveying interests in certain oil and gas leases for the wells. Because the sellers conveyed their interests by quitclaim, we received no warranty or representation from them that they owned their interests free and clear from adverse claims by third parties or other title defects. We have no title insurance, guaranty or warranty for our interests in the wells. Further, the wells may be subject to prior, unregistered agreements, or transfers which have not been recorded.\nAccordingly, we cannot guarantee that we hold clear title to our interests or that our interests will not be challenged in the future. If our interests were challenged, expenses for curative title work, litigation or other dispute resolution mechanisms may be incurred. Loss of our interests would reduce or eliminate our production operations and reduce or eliminate the partial natural hedge that our marketing and production subsidiary currently enjoys as a result of our production capabilities. For all of these reasons, a challenge to our ownership could negatively impact our earnings, profits and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations, impact our business plans and expose us to environmental liabilities.\nEnvironmental regulations that may affect our present and future operations include regulation of air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals, and can result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.\nWe may be a responsible party for environmental clean-up at sites identified by a regulatory body in the future. If that occurs, we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties.\nWe cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations intended to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have a net deferred tax asset of $3,243 and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a significant portion of this tax asset, which could lead to a write-down or loss of the tax asset and adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe recorded a net deferred tax asset as the result of our acquisitions of Frontier Natural Gas and Bangor Gas in 2007. This tax asset was $3,243 at December 31, 2016. We may continue to depreciate approximately $11,092 of Frontier Natural Gas\u2019s and Bangor Gas\u2019s capital assets using the useful lives and rates employed by those companies, resulting in future potential federal and state income tax benefits over a 20 year period using applicable federal and state income tax rates. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, our ability to recognize tax deductions as a result of this tax benefit was limited during the first five years following the acquisitions.\nManagement will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset each year on completion of updated estimates of taxable income for future periods, and will reduce the deferred tax asset by the new valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the recognized deferred tax assets. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the $3,243 net deferred tax asset over the remaining useful life of the asset. A write down in the deferred tax asset or expiration of the asset before it is utilized would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains provisions requiring us to assess the effectiveness of internal control for financial reporting, as well as attestation and reporting by independent auditors on our internal control over financial reporting in addition to other control-related matters.\nCompliance with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. There is a risk that we will not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 because of the discovery of material weaknesses. Further, during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadlines imposed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOur actual results of operations could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our management often must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the regulatory accounting policy to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved. Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators to be reflected in the financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets will be written off as a charge in current period earnings.\nOur operations could give rise to risk in cyber-attacks.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our business. Disruptions in our computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the interruption of operations.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with acquiring and integrating new business operations.\nThe growth of our business will depend to a great extent on our ability to acquire new assets or business operations and to integrate the operations of businesses that we may acquire in the future. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 identify suitable acquisition candidates or opportunities,\n\u00b7 detect all actual and potential problems that may exist in the operations or financial condition of an acquisition candidate,\n\u00b7 acquire assets or business operations on commercially acceptable terms,\n\u00b7 ascertain, prior to the consummation of an acquisition, whether we will be required to take write-downs or write-offs, or make restructuring and impairment charges or other charges,\n\u00b7 satisfy the terms and conditions of any state or federal regulatory approvals required for an acquisition,\n\u00b7 effectively integrate the operations of any acquired assets or businesses with our existing operations,\n\u00b7 achieve our operating and growth strategies with respect to the acquired assets or businesses,\n\u00b7 reduce our overall selling, general, and administrative expenses associated with the acquired assets or businesses, or\n\u00b7 comply with the internal control requirements of Section 404 as a result of an acquisition.\nThe integration of the management, personnel, operations, products, services, technologies, and facilities of any businesses that we acquire could involve unforeseen difficulties. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract our management and employees, and increase our expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may have cash deposits at financial institutions in excess of insured limits.\nOur cash is held at financial institutions within the United States. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash was maintained in accounts that are insured up to the limit determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We at times have balances in excess of the federally insured limits. Periodically, we evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions, and we have not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nOur proposed merger is subject to certain risks.\nThere are risks related to the Merger Agreement, including:\n\u00b7 any event, change or circumstance that might give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement,\n\u00b7 the effect of the proposed Merger on our relationships with our customers, operating results and business generally,\n\u00b7 the risk that the Merger will not be consummated in a timely manner,\n\u00b7 the failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, approval of government or regulatory agencies with regard to the Merger,\n\u00b7 the failure of one or more conditions to the closing of the Merger to be satisfied,\n\u00b7 risks arising from the Merger\u2019s diversion of management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations; and\n\u00b7 risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed.\nFuture issuances of our common stock may dilute the interests of existing shareholders.\nWe have issued shares of our common stock and may issue additional shares of our common stock to finance acquisitions, for general corporate purposes, or to make investments. For example, in 2013 we consummated a transaction to purchase the assets of JDOG Marketing for shares of our common stock. The issuance of additional shares may result in economic dilution to our existing shareholders.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited.\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends at our current dividend rate or at all. In particular, our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash requirements, state ring fencing provisions, and covenants under our existing credit facilities and any future credit agreements as well as the Merger Agreement. In addition, acquisitions funded by the issuance of our common stock or future issuances to raise capital will increase the number of our shares outstanding and may make it more difficult to continue paying dividends at our current rate. Our long-term ability to continue paying dividends will depend on our ability to generate commensurate earnings from our utility operations and control costs. In both 2015 and 2016, our net income per share was less than our per share dividend paid for the year.\nFinancial covenants contained in our credit facilities place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our growth, business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, ability to pay dividends, and financial condition. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the debt under the credit facilities or other agreements we may enter into from time to time that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nThe possible issuance of future series of preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued preferred stock and to issue those shares without any further action or vote by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. These adverse effects could include subordination to preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and dissolution, and the use of preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure, which could impede a change in control that is otherwise in the interests of holders of our common stock.\nOur charter documents Ohio law, and the Merger Agreement, as well as certain utility laws and regulations, may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and code of regulations, the Merger Agreement, and state utility laws and regulations, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, allow the removal of directors only for cause, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings. The Merger Agreement contains no-shop provisions prohibiting us from, among other things soliciting or participating in negotiations regarding any proposal or offer that constitutes or could lead to an acquisition proposal, or entering into any agreement relating to such a proposal, subject to fiduciary out provisions applicable prior to receipt of the approval of our shareholders on December 28, 2016. Under the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of approximately $4.8 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. Additionally, Ohio corporate law provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Assuming compliance with the prescribed notice and information filings, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if, at a meeting of shareholders, the acquisition is approved by both a majority of our shares and a majority of the voting shares remaining after excluding the combined voting of the \u201cinterested shares,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Some takeover attempts may even be subject to approval by the Ohio Division of Securities or the PUCO. The application of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe value of our common stock may decline significantly if we do not maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT Equities stock exchange.\nIn addition to federal and state regulation of our utility operations and regulation by the SEC, we are subject to the listing requirements of NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT rules contain requirements with respect to corporate governance, communications with shareholders, the trading price of shares of our common stock, and various other matters. We believe we are in compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those listing requirements in the future. If we fail to comply with listing requirements, the NYSE MKT could de-list our stock. If our stock was de-listed from NYSE MKT, our shares would likely trade in the Over The Counter Bulletin Board, but the ability of our shareholders to sell our stock could be impaired because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and our security analysts\u2019 coverage may be reduced. Further, because of the additional regulatory burdens imposed upon broker-dealers with respect to de-listed companies, delisting could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our stock, further limiting the liquidity of our shares. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, liquidity, value and marketability of our common stock.\nOrganization, Structure and Management Risks\nOur credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that may reduce our flexibility, and adversely affect our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe terms of our credit facilities impose significant restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries, to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including:\n\u00b7 requiring us to meet certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate,\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to sell assets, make investments in or acquire assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies,\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to repurchase or redeem our stock or enter into transactions with our shareholders or affiliates, and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities.\nThese covenants place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our growth, business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, and financial condition. Our failure to comply with any of the financial covenants in the credit facilities may result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the debt under the credit facilities or other agreements we may enter into from time to time that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If this occurs, there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay such indebtedness, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur primary assets are our operating subsidiaries, and there are limits on our ability to obtain revenue from those subsidiaries, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to shareholders.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations and our principal assets are the equity securities of our subsidiary utilities. We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for our cash flows, thus our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and finance acquisitions depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends to us. Further, our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us, and although they are wholly owned and controlled by us, our ability to obtain distributions from them by way of dividends, interest or other payments (including intercompany loans) is subject to restrictions imposed by our regulators. For example:\n\u00b7 we may cause our Maine, Montana, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries to pay a dividend not to exceed the subsidiaries\u2019 net income calculated on a two year rolling average basis,\n\u00b7 we may cause our Ohio utilities to distribute dividends not to cause cash liquidity on hand to fall below 90 days.\nOur credit facilities and ring-fencing restrictions have covenants that place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and financial condition as well as our ability to finance acquisitions or pay dividends. Further, we may be required to comply with additional covenants. Failure to comply with financial covenants may result in the acceleration of the debt and foreclosure of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition. For further details on the financial covenants contained in the credit facilities, see the \u201cRestrictions on Dividends\u201d subsection of Note 14 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information.\nOur performance depends substantially on the performance of our executive officers and other key personnel and the ability of our management team to fully implement our business strategy.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate high quality personnel, especially highly qualified managerial personnel. Poor execution in the performance of our management team or the loss of services of key executive officers or personnel could impair our ability to successfully operate and to acquire and integrate new business operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into transactions with related parties, and shareholders and potential investors in Gas Natural may not value these transactions in the same manner as those with unrelated parties.\nWe have entered into agreements and transactions with Richard M. Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer. In the future we will continue to perform as required under these agreements until they expire and alternative sources are found to replace the services provided.\nOn April 15, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note for $4,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we make monthly interest payments, based on an annual rate of 7.5% and the principal balance of the note is due upon maturity on November 15, 2016. On October 19, 2016, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished.\nOn October 23, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement and promissory note with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding loaned us $3,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 6.95%, and a maturity date of April 20, 2016.
