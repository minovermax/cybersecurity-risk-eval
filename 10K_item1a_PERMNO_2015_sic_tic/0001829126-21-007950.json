{"cik": "926844", "company": "China Botanic Pharmaceutical", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestment in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks we describe below before deciding to invest. The market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, in which case you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. You should pay particular attention to the fact that we are a holding company with substantial operations in China and are subject to legal and regulatory environments that in many respects differ from that of the United States. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be affected materially and adversely by any of the risks discussed below and any others not foreseen. This discussion contains forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur products may not achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance.\nSuccess of our products is highly dependent on market acceptance. We believe that market acceptance of our products will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the perceived advantages of our products over competing products and the availability and success of competing products;\n\u25cf the brand effect of our products and channel loyalty;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf the pricing and cost effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf the efficacy of our products and the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects, if any; and\n\u25cf publicity concerning our products, product candidates or competing products.\nIf our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, or if new products are introduced by others that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or otherwise render our products obsolete, or if our competitors spend much more in sales and marketing efforts than we do, we may experience a decline in the demand for our products. If we are unable to market and sell our products successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operation and future growth would be adversely affected.\nOur future research and development projects may not be successful.\nThe successful development of pharmaceutical products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to be promising at their early phases of research and development may fail to be commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, the research and development cycle for new products for which we may obtain an approval certificate is long.\nThere is no assurance that all of our future research and development projects will be successful or completed within the anticipated time frame or budget or that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities for the production of these newly developed products, or that these newly developed products will achieve commercial success. Even if such products can be successfully commercialized, they may not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect.\nWe face substantial competition in connection with the marketing and sale of our products.\nOur products compete with products with similar medical efficacy in similar market areas. Some of our competitors are well established and may have greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources. The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by the frequent introduction of new products. We may be unable to compete successfully or our competitors may develop products which have greater medical efficacy or gain wider market acceptance than ours.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were ineffective until recently, although we have taken remedial measures, if we are unable to effectively improve and maintain such controls and procedures, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other reports, the price of our shares of common stock may decline, and we may be subject to increased risks and liabilities.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Securities Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we include a report of our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to include quarterly reports and certifications of our management regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. In the past, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were ineffective due to our late filings, and more recently, that we lack sufficient qualified accounting and financial personnel with an appropriate level of US GAAP knowledge and experience appropriate to meet our financial reporting requirements. Although we have been diligent in implementing remedial measures since the third quarter of fiscal 2009, including hiring a new chief financial officer with US GAAP and SEC reporting experience, adding additional staff, appointing three independent directors to our board of directors, engaging consultants to advise management on the preparation of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year 2010, there is no assurance that we will continue to have effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot effectively and efficiently improve our controls and procedures, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and other information we report and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information. This could lead to a decline in the trading price of our shares of common stock. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from NYSE Amex, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur chairman, chief executive officer and president currently owns approximately 48% of our common stock and has the ability to prevent certain types of corporate actions, to the detriment of other stockholders.\nAs of October 31, 2011, Mr. Shaoming Li, our chairman, chief executive officer and president, owns 17,850,000 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 48% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. Li is able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of a majority of the directors and determination of significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have entered into and may continue to enter into transactions with related parties.\nWe have entered into, and may continue to enter into, transactions with our related parties, including without limitation Heilongjiang Renhuang Pharmaceutical Limited and Harbin Renhuang Pharmaceutical Stock Co., Ltd. (\u201cRenhuang Stock\u201d), during the normal course of our business or otherwise. Mr. Shaoming Li, a major stockholder of ours and our chairman, chief executive officer and president, is a major stockholder of Heilongjiang Renhuang Pharmaceutical Limited and chairman of the board of directors and 50% stockholder of Renhuang Stock Among others, in 2009, we entered into purchase agreements with Renhuang Stock to acquire certain real property and intellectual property for a total consideration of $25,096,070 and $2,456,625, respectively. The purchase prices were based on fair market value appraised by independent third party appraisal firm. Although we believe that the transactions we have entered into with Heilongjiang Renhuang Pharmaceutical Limited and Renhuang Stock are, on the whole, no more favorable, and no less favorable, than those available from unaffiliated third parties, there were no independent directors on our board at those times to approve such transactions. As such, the transactions were approved by only Mr. Shaoming Li in his capacity as our sole director. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d We may continue to enter into transactions with Heilongjiang Renhuang Pharmaceutical Limited and Renhuang Stock in the future.\nWe may not be able to manage our expansion of operations effectively.\nWe anticipate significant continued expansion of our business to address growth in demand for our products, as well as to capture new market opportunities. To manage the potential growth of our operations, we will be required to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, increase manufacturing capacity and output, expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and continuously increase our promotion budget. Furthermore, we need to maintain and expand our relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. In addition, the success of our growth strategy depends on a number of internal and external factors, such as the expected growth of the pharmaceutical market in China and the competition from other pharmaceutical companies. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur future liquidity needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nWe may, from time to time, need to raise funds as part of our business operations, such as to devote financial resources to research and development of projects that we believe to have significant commercialization potential, and the acquisition or construction of manufacturing facilities. We cannot assure you that our revenues will be sufficient to meet our operational needs and capital requirements. If we need to obtain external financing, we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future liquidity needs and other business reasons could require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nThe retail prices of certain of our products are subject to control, including periodic adjustment, by PRC government authorities.\nCertain of our pharmaceutical products, primarily those included in the national and provincial Medical Insurance Catalogs, are subject to price controls in the form of fixed retail prices or retail price ceilings. As such, the retail prices for certain of our pharmaceutical products can be adjusted downward or upward from time to time. If the retail prices of our products are reduced by the government, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCurrently, of our products, Siberian Ginseng Tablets, Compound Yangjiao Tablets, Tianman Tablets, Banlangen Granules, Qing Re Jie Du Oral Liquid, Compound Honeysuckle Granules and Shengmai Granules, are subject to such price controls. These seven products accounted for 36.2% of our total sales in fiscal year 2011.\nOur results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in availability and price of raw materials.\nThe raw materials we use are subject to price fluctuations due to various factors beyond our control, including, among other pertinent factors:\n\u25cf increasing market demand;\n\u25cf inflation;\n\u25cf severe climatic and environmental conditions;\n\u25cf seasonal factors, and\n\u25cf changes in governmental regulations and programs.\nChanges to our raw materials prices may result in increases in production and packaging costs, and we may be unable to raise the prices of our products to offset the increased costs in the short-term or at all. As a result, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nExtensive regulation of the pharmaceutical manufacturers industry in China could increase our expenses resulting in reduced profits.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which our products are manufactured or sold, regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution and labeling of our products. Our processing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by national, provincial and local authorities. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material governmental laws and regulations and maintain all permits and licenses relating to our operations.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nClinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf determination of dosing issues;\n\u25cf lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols\nIn addition, we (or SFDA), may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the regulatory bodies find serious deficiencies in our investigational new drug, submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for future clinical trials.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates.\nPhysicians, patients and other end consumer may abandon existing drugs or choose not to accept and use our new drugs.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our products. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u25cf perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; and\n\u25cf effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect sales of our current and future products to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure to find market acceptance would materially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur drug-development program depends upon third-party research scientists who are not subject to our control.\nWe depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our applications, and our introduction of new drugs, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position and business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other similar product oriented companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. We will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u25cf developing drugs;\n\u25cf undertaking pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u25cf formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u25cf launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes. A large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in China and other countries. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.\nWe have limited protection and are subject to substantial competition.\nWe have three patented production techniques, Injection Preparation Method against Hepatitis B (Patent No.: ZL200410043718.5), Total Alkaloids of Sophora Flavescens Extraction Method (Patent No.: ZL200410043717.0), and \u201cExtraction of effective ingredients of Siberian Ginseng and its preparation and application\u201d, (Patent No.: ZL200710301682X). We will receive another five patents through purchase agreements made in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2011. Many pharmaceutical companies compete in the same market segment with similar products or products having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which may be used as direct substitutes for our products. As a result of the lack of patent protection, competitors with potential substitutes could launch similar products in the market with their prices analogous to or lower than those manufactured and sold by us. Further, the lack of patent protection could also attract an even greater number of competitors who believe they can develop products that are substantially similar to ours at a lower cost.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain applicable regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, or if such clearances or approvals are delayed, we will be unable to distribute our products in a timely manner, or at all, which could significantly disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nThe sale and marketing of our products are subject to regulation in the PRC and in most other countries where we intend to conduct business. For a significant portion of our products, we need to obtain and renew licenses and registrations with the PRC State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA, and its equivalent in other markets. The processes for obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be lengthy and expensive, and the results are unpredictable. Our PRC subsidiary is in the process of renewing the approval registrations for its products and medicines that are currently in production. Such applications have been accepted by SFDA and our PRC subsidiary is allowed by SFDA to continue to use the current drug approval numbers to manufacture its products and medicines during the application period. If we are unable to obtain clearances or approvals needed to market existing or new products, or obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion, our business could be significantly disrupted and our sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our PRC subsidiary is producing three products which are registered under the name of Renhuang Stock pursuant to the agreements between Renhuang Stock and our PRC subsidiary related to the free use of drug approval numbers. We have submitted applications to SFDA for the transfer of the registrations of these three products from Renhuang Stock to us. Before the transfer is completed, such arrangement made by our PRC subsidiary may be deemed as producing these three products without obtaining required drug approvals, which may result in administrative penalties including confiscation of the inventories of these three products, confiscation of the gains arising from the manufacturing of these three products, fines, suspension of the operation and/or revocation of the Drug Production Permit of our PRC subsidiary.\nIn particular, as we enter foreign markets, we lack the experience and familiarity with both the regulators and the regulatory systems, which could make the process more difficult, more costly, more time consuming and less likely to succeed.\nCompliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly, which could harm our business.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with regulatory requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission has required and will require us to make changes in our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, which have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These risks are greater for our products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Even if a product were approved for commercial use by an appropriate governmental agency, there can be no assurance that users will not claim effects other than those intended resulted from the use of our products. While to date no material claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been brought against us, a substantial claim or a substantial number of claims, if successful, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly, which could harm our business.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with regulatory requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission has required and will require us to make changes in our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. In addition, we have incurred costs and will continue to incur costs in connection with ensuring that we are in compliance with rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, which have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are unable to assure that all of the distributors and sales centers which are selling our products have obtained the medicine supply approvals and meet the Good Supply Practice standards.\nA distributor of pharmaceutical products in China must obtain pharmaceutical distribution permit from the competent provincial or local SFDA branch. Furthermore, SFDA applies Good Supply Practice standards, or GSP standards, to all pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors to ensure quality of drug distribution in China.\nWe believe that our PRC subsidiary does not need to apply for the pharmaceutical distribution permit or GSP certification because our PRC subsidiary does not engage in the wholesale or retail of pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s medicines. Instead, we have entered into sales agency agreements with sales agents in 19 provinces and four municipalities, through which our products are sold to over 3,000 distributors and over 70 sales centers in China. Such distributors need to obtain the pharmaceutical distribution permit and GSP certification to sell our products. We are unable to assure that all of the distributors and sales centers which are selling our products have obtained the medicine supply approvals and meet the Good Supply Practice standards.\nWe current produce our Siberian Ginseng Extract, Ginseng and Venison Extract and Badger Oil through a drug approval number using agreement with Renhuang Stock which may not be legal under the SFDA regulations.\nPursuant to drug approval number using agreements between Renhuang Stock and our PRC subsidiary, our PRC subsidiary is producing three products, namely Siberian Ginseng Extract, Ginseng and Venison Extract and Badger Oil, which are registered under the name of Renhuang Stock. These three products are produced in Dofanghong pharmaceutical plant, which we lease from Renhuang Stock. We have submitted applications to SFDA for the transfer of the registrations of these three products from Renhuang Stock to us. However, such arrangement made by our PRC subsidiary may be deemed as producing these three products without obtaining required drug approvals before we obtain the production permission of the drugs, which may result in administrative penalties including confiscation of the inventories of these three products, confiscation of the gains arising from the manufacturing of these three products, fines, suspension of the operation and/or revocation of the Drug Production Permit of our PRC subsidiary.\nWe have a limited operating history and limited historical financial information upon which you may evaluate our performance.\nWe began our operations in 2006 and continue to face risks in a growth industry. We may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment. Even if we accomplish these objectives, we may not generate positive cash flows or the profits we anticipate in the future.\nWe rely on key executive officers and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nOur success is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to retain the services of our executive management, who have contributed to our growth and expansion to date. Our chairman, chief executive officer and president, Mr. Shaoming Li, has been, and will continue to be, instrumental to our success. Accordingly, the loss of his services, without suitable replacements, will have an adverse effect on our business generally, operating results and future prospects. We have not entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Li.\nIn addition, the loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur holding company structure may hinder the payment of dividends.\nChina Botanic Pharmaceutical Inc. has no direct business operations, other than its ownership of our subsidiaries. We intend reinvest all undistributed earnings to expand our PRC operations, which the management would be most benefit our shareholder. Should we decide in the future to payout dividends, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us due to restrictive covenants in agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries. If future dividends are paid in Renminbi, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\nA provision has not been made at October 31, 2011 for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $79,375,132 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is the present intention of management to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely in foreign operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nOur manufacturing plants are located in China and our pharmaceutical and medical products production, sale and distribution are subject to Chinese regulation.\nEconomic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government could change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time. This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some changes that could have this effect are: (i) level of government involvement in the economy; (ii) control of foreign exchange; (iii) methods of allocating resources; (iv) balance of payment positions; (v) international trade restrictions; and (vi) international conflict. Additionally, as a manufacturer of pharmaceutical and medical products located in China, we are a state-licensed company and facility and subject to Chinese regulations and laws. The Chinese government has been active in regulating the pharmaceutical industry. If we were to lose our state-licensed status we would no longer be able to manufacture pharmaceuticals in China, which is our sole operation.\nWe depend upon governmental laws and regulations that may be changed in ways that will harm our business.\nOur business and products are subject to government regulations mandating the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals in China and other countries. Changes in the laws or regulations in China, or other countries we sell into, that govern or apply to our operations could have a materially adverse effect on our business. For example, the law could change so as to prohibit the use of certain pharmaceuticals. If one of our pharmaceuticals or medical products is prohibited, this change would reduce our productivity of that product.\nThe Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nChina only recently has permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, pharmaceutical regulations, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nThe Chinese legal system may have inherent uncertainties that could materially and adversely impact our ability to enforce the agreements governing our operations.\nWe are subject to oversight at the provincial and local levels of government. Our operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected by the failure of the local government to honor our agreements or an adverse change in the laws governing them. In the event of a dispute, enforcement of these agreements could be difficult in China. China tends to issue legislation, which is followed by implementing regulations, interpretations and guidelines that can render immediate compliance difficult. Similarly, on occasion, conflicts arise between national legislation and implementation by the provinces that take time to reconcile. These factors can present difficulties in our ability to achieve compliance. Unlike the United States, China has a civil law system based on written statutes in which judicial decisions have limited precedential value. The Chinese government has enacted laws and regulations to deal with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, our experience in interpreting and enforcing our rights under these laws and regulations is limited, and our future ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes in China is therefore unpredictable. These matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces and factors unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination.\nIt will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our officers, directors and assets based in China.\nSubstantially all of our assets will be located outside of the United States and most of our officers and directors will reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for United States investors to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws of the United States. Moreover, we have been advised that the PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties of the Federal securities laws of the United States.\nNational, provincial and local governments have established many regulations governing our business operations.\nWe are also subject to numerous national, provincial and local governmental regulations, including environmental, labor, waste management, health and safety matters and product specifications and regulatory approvals from healthcare agencies. We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees including: wage requirements, limitations on hours worked, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, work permits and travel restrictions. These local labor laws and regulations may require substantial resources for compliance. Our PRC subsidiary may not fully contribute the social insurance and housing fund for the employees and the failure to do so may result in penalties and fines from PRC labor administration authorities at the provincial and local level. We are also subject to significant government regulation with regard to property ownership and use in connection with our facilities in the PRC, import restrictions, currency restrictions and restrictions on the volume of domestic sales and other areas of regulation. These regulations can limit our ability to react to market pressures in a timely or effective way, thus causing us to lose business or miss opportunities to expand our business.\nThe PRC currency is not a freely convertible currency and fluctuations in the exchange rate between the PRC currency and the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe PRC currency, the \u201cRenminbi\u201d or \u201cRMB,\u201d is not a freely convertible currency. We rely on the PRC government\u2019s foreign currency conversion policies, which may change at any time, in regard to our currency exchange needs. This substantial regulation by the PRC government of foreign currency exchange may restrict our business operations and a change in any of these government policies could negatively impact our operations, which could result in a loss of profits.\nThe functional currency of our operations in China is the Renminbi. However, results of our operations are translated at average exchange rates into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting results. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. We do not currently use hedging techniques, and any hedging techniques which we may use in the future, may not be able to eliminate and may exacerbate the effects of currency fluctuations. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could cause our profits, and therefore our stock prices, to decline.\nWe are subject to various tax regimes, which may adversely affect our profitability and tax liabilities in the future.\nWe are incorporated in the U.S. and have subsidiaries and other operations in the PRC and the British Virgin Islands. We will be subject to the tax regimes of these countries. Although virtually all of our profits will be earned outside of the U.S., under U.S. tax laws our earnings generally will be subject to U.S. taxation, because U.S. companies are generally taxed on their world-wide income. This may be true even if we do not repatriate any of its foreign earnings to the U.S. For certain types of income (generally, income from an active trade or business), U.S. companies are not required to pay tax on that income until they repatriate those earnings to the U.S. (such as for use in paying dividends or repurchasing shares). As a result, repatriation of earnings would trigger more immediate tax obligations. As a result of the imposition of U.S. taxes, our after-tax profits could decrease and could be below the level that would have been obtained if we were incorporated outside the U.S. The amount of taxes payable in the U.S. generally depends on the profitability of our various operations and the application of available tax credits and tax treaties. We are not currently receiving the benefit of any U.S. tax credit, and we are not currently conducting a material amount of business in a country with an advantageous tax treaty. Since the effect of tax credits and tax treaties depends on the profitability of operations in various jurisdictions, the amount of our tax will vary over time as we change the geographic scope of our activities. However, for the near term we expect that our total tax rate will be significantly influenced by the taxes we pay in China, so that our total tax obligation might decrease as a result of favorable tax treatment in China even though we were subject to additional U.S. taxes. In the future, we may pay significantly higher taxes than we have paid historically. In addition, any change in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation or application thereof, either internally in one of those jurisdictions or as between those jurisdictions, may adversely affect our profitability and tax liabilities in the future.\nFrom January, 2011, our PRC subsidiary was granted a 10% tax exempt and paid 15% of enterprise income tax. Before that time, our PRC subsidiary was granted by the national tax office of Ah City a tax holiday and was fully exempt from the 25% enterprise income tax. This tax holiday was granted, without a statutory basis at the national level, by the governmental authorities of Ah City for the purposes of promoting local economic development.\nBecause Chinese law governs almost all of our material agreements, we may not be able to enforce our legal rights internationally, which might results in a significant loss of business, business opportunities, or capital.\nChinese law will govern almost all of our material agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce any of our material agreements or that remedies will be available outside of the PRC. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in the PRC may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The Chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law, leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe market price of our shares is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations.\nThe price of our common shares may be subject to wide fluctuations due to variations in our operating results, news announcements, our limited trading volume, general market trends both domestically and internationally, currency movements, sales of common shares by our officers, directors and our principal stockholders, and sales of common shares by existing investors. Certain events, such as the issuance of common shares upon the exercise of our outstanding stock options, could also materially and adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares. Further, the stock markets in general have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. In addition, a change in sentiment by U.S. investors for China-based companies could have a negative impact on the stock price. These fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the ability to resell shares at or above the price paid, or at any price.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue new series of preferred stock that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could adversely affect the value of your shares.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors will be authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, rights of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designations of any series. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights, and by the creation of class or series voting rights.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends.\nWe expect to apply our future earnings, if any, toward the further expansion and development of our business. The likelihood of us paying dividends is further reduced by the fact that, in order to pay dividends, we would need to repatriate profits earned outside of the U.S., and in doing so those profits generally would become subject to U.S. taxation. Thus, the liquidity of your investment is dependent upon your ability to sell your shares at an acceptable price, rather than receiving an income stream from your investment. The price of our stock may decline and fluctuations in market price coupled with limited trading volume in our shares may limit your ability to realize any value from your investment, including recovering the initial purchase price.\nThe market price for our shares may be volatile.\nThe market price for our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and changes or revisions of our expected results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in the markets for our products;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us, or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of senior management and key personnel; and\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar.\nVolatility in the price of our shares may result in stockholder litigation that could in turn result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe financial markets in the United States and other countries have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and market prices have been and continue to be extremely volatile. Volatility in the price of our shares may be caused by factors outside of our control and may be unrelated or disproportionate to our results of operations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company\u2019s securities, stockholders have frequently instituted securities class action litigation against that company. Litigation of this kind could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our shares, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our shares only if those shares appreciate in value.\nWe currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of the business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on factors our board of directors deems relevant, including among others, our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of our credit facilities, if any, and any other financing arrangements. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our shares, and there is no guarantee that our shares will appreciate in value.\nWe may need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe believe that our current cash and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. As of October 31, 2011, we had cash of approximately $15.28 million and total current assets of approximately $51.07 million. As of October 31, 2011, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $40.27 million. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain one or more additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. It is uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the issuance of additional shares will dilute all other stockholdings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation permits the issuance of up to approximately 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which there are 37,239,536 outstanding as of October 31, 2011. Thus, we have the ability to issue substantial amounts of common stock in the future, which would dilute the percentage ownership held by our current stockholders.", "PERMNO": 12014, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CBPI"}
