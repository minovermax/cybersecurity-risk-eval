The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us, or that we currently perceive as immaterial or remote, may also occur. If any of the following risks or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our stock. You should not draw any inference as to the magnitude of any particular risk from its position in the following discussion.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe need substantial additional capital to develop our products and for our operations in the near term. If we are unable to obtain such funds when needed, we may have to delay, scale back or terminate our product development or our business.\nConducting the costly and time consuming research, pre-clinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and bring our products to market will require a commitment of substantial funds in excess of our current capital. The audit opinion accompanying our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included under Item 8 of this report, includes an explanatory paragraph indicating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our future operations. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures for Angionetics to increase over the next several years as it works to advance Generx through late stage clinical trials, secure regulatory approval, begin to commercialization. Angionetics will need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u2022\nFund the completion of its U.S.-based Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical trial for Generx;\n\u2022\nFund additional clinical trials and preclinical trials for Generx as requested or required by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nFund clinical trials and preclinical trials for Generx in new indications;\n\u2022\nSustain commercialization of Generx or any other new product candidate;\n\u2022\nDevelop manufacturing capabilities, if any;\n\u2022\nIncrease sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nFinance general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nMaintain, expand and protect its intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nAdd operational, financial and management information systems; and\n\u2022\nHire additional clinical, quality, scientific, and general and administrative personnel.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others: the progress of our current and new product development programs; the progress, scope and results of our pre-clinical and clinical testing; the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; the cost of manufacturing our products and product candidates; the cost of prosecuting, enforcing and defending against patent claims and other intellectual property rights; competing technological and market developments; and our ability to establish and maintain collaborative and other arrangements with third parties to assist in potentially bringing our products to market and/or to monetize the economic value of our product portfolio.\nWe cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, we may need to take actions that adversely affect our business, our stock price and our ability to achieve cash flow in the future, including possibly surrendering our rights to some technologies or product opportunities, delaying our clinical trials or curtailing or ceasing operations.\nIf we raise capital through the sale of equity securities it may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or we issue securities in connection with another transaction, the ownership position of existing stockholders could be substantially diluted. Anti-dilution adjustments to our securities currently outstanding would cause further dilution. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities, these securities are likely to have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock and may involve significant fees, interest expense, restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests in our assets.\nIn order to raise capital to fund the development of our Generx product candidate we have sold shares in our Angionetics subsidiary. Our management did this because it believed that it could raise capital at a better valuation, and with less dilution to existing stockholders, than if it were to sell shares of Taxus Cardium. If Angionetics continues to issue additional equity securities to third party investors, as is currently planned, it will dilute the interest of Taxus Cardium, and consequently our stockholders in Angionetics and the Generx product candidate.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in December 2003 and expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.\nWe have sustained operating losses to date and will likely continue to sustain losses as we seek to develop our products and product candidates. We expect these losses to be substantial because of the significant amounts we expect to spend on development activities and clinical trials for our product candidates. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was approximately $115 million, and our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $22,000. To date, we have generated very limited revenues and a large portion of our expenses are fixed, including expenses related to facilities, equipment, contractual commitments and personnel. As a result, we expect our net losses from operations to continue for at least the next few years.\nWhether we will generate additional revenues and become profitable will depend largely on our ability, alone or with potential collaborators, to efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates, successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical tests, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and manufacture and market our products. There can be no assurance that any such events will occur or that we will ever become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot predict the level of such profitability. If we sustain losses over an extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our business.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in its clinical trials, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. Further, even if we view the results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that Angionetics obtains negative results from the AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study or receives poor clinical results for other product candidates, or the FDA chooses to block progress of the trials, or does not approve our Biologics License Application for Generx, Angionetics may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue operations. In such event, our ability to execute on our current business plan will be materially impaired, our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged, and the price of our stock would likely decrease significantly.\nOur technologies and product candidates may have unacceptable side effects that could delay or prevent product approval.\nSide effects of therapeutic technologies can be serious and life threatening. While we are not presently aware of any side effects from the use of Generx, possible serious side effects of gene transfer include viral or gene product toxicity resulting in inflammation or other injury to the heart or other parts of the body. The development or worsening of cancer in a patient could potentially be a perceived or actual side effect of gene therapy technologies. Furthermore, there is a possibility of side effects or decreased effectiveness associated with an immune response toward any viral vector or gene used in gene therapy. The possibility of such response may increase if there is a need to deliver the viral vector more than once.\nIf Generx or any of our product candidates are found, prior to or after any approval for commercial sale, to cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nWe may voluntarily interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials or regulatory authorities may require that we interrupt, delay interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials;\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may deny regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nWe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u2022\nOur reputation may suffer.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any planned clinical trial of Generx or any other of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our strategic alliance partners.\nWe rely on third party clinical research organizations to manage our clinical trials. Consequently we have less control over the conduct of the clinical trials and may experience delays or errors in our clinical trials that could adversely affect our business, financial results and commercial prospects.\nTo obtain regulatory approvals for new products, we must, among other things, initiate and successfully complete multiple clinical trials demonstrating to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority that our product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for a particular indication. We rely on third party clinical research organizations to assist us in designing, administering and assessing the results of those trials. We are dependent upon them to timely and accurately perform their services. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, delays in our clinical trials. Our development costs will increase and our business may be negatively impacted, if we experience delays in testing or approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned, for reasons such as the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other health regulatory authorities, or institutional review boards, do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\nsuitable patients do not enroll in a clinical study in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate, or data is adversely affected by trial conduct or patient drop out;\n\u2022\npatients experience serious adverse events, including adverse side effects of our drug candidate or device;\n\u2022\npatients die during a clinical study for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates, including the advanced stage of their disease and medical problems;\n\u2022\npatients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibit greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical study protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nservice providers, collaborators or co-sponsors do not adequately perform their obligations in relation to the clinical study or cause the study to be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us or a co-sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe interim results of the clinical study are inconclusive or negative;\n\u2022\nthe clinical study, although approved and completed, generates data that is not considered by the FDA or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy; or\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions affect the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its results.\nSignificant delays may adversely affect our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates and delay our ability to become profitable. If third party organizations do not accurately collect and assess the trial data, we may discontinue development of viable product candidates or continue allocating resources to the development and marketing of product candidates that are not efficacious. Either outcome could result in significant financial harm to our company and damage to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to enter into successful sales, marketing and distribution agreements with third parties, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products.\nWe rely on collaborations or other arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our products. Under these arrangements third parties would be largely responsible for the timing and extent of sales and marketing efforts, they may not dedicate sufficient resources to our product opportunities, and our ability to cause them to devote additional resources or to otherwise promote sales of our products may be limited. In addition, to the extent that we enter into licensing, distributorship, co-promotion, co-marketing or other collaborative arrangements, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products on a direct basis.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties to market our Excellagen product and to date have not been successful in generating material sales. We have also entered into agreements with third parties to market our Generx product in certain territories if approved by relevant regulatory authorities, but there can be no assurance that the efforts of such third parties will meet our expectations or result in any significant product sales.\nEven if approved for marketing, our technologies and product candidates are relatively novel and unproven and they may fail to gain market acceptance.\nOur ongoing business and future depends on the success of our technologies and product candidates. Gene-based therapy, like our Generx\u00ae product candidate, is a new and rapidly evolving medical approach that has any not been shown to be effective on a widespread basis. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have successfully developed and commercialized only a limited number of biologic-based products to date and no gene therapy has yet been successfully commercialized. Our product candidates, and the technology underlying them, are new and unproven and there is no guarantee that health care providers or patients will be interested in our products even if they are approved for use.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefits, reliability, safety and cost effectiveness of our product candidates and technology relative to other approaches, as well as on our ability to continue to develop our product candidates to respond to competitive and technological changes. If the market does not accept our products or product candidates, when and if we are able to commercialize them, then we may never become profitable. It is difficult to predict the future growth of our business, if any, and the size of the market for our product candidates because the market and technology are continually evolving. There can be no assurance that our technologies and product candidates will prove superior to technologies and products that may currently be available or may become available in the future or that our technologies or research and development activities will result in any commercially profitable products.\nWe will rely on third parties to manufacture our products and product candidates. There can be no guarantee that we can obtain sufficient and acceptable quantities of our product candidates on acceptable terms, which may delay or impair our ability to develop, test and market such products.\nOur business strategy relies on third parties to manufacture and produce our products and product candidates and the catheters used to deliver the products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA and other regulators. These third party manufacturers are subject to extensive government regulation and must receive FDA approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product.\nOur products and product candidates may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if our contract manufacturers give other products greater priority than our products. These third parties also may not deliver sufficient quantities of our products, manufacture our products in accordance with specifications, or comply with applicable government regulations. Successful large-scale manufacturing of gene-based therapy products has been accomplished by very few companies, and significant process development changes may be necessary before commercializing and manufacturing any of our biologic product candidates. Additionally, if the manufactured products fail to perform as specified, our business and reputation could be severely impacted.\nIf any manufacturing agreement is terminated or any third party service provider or collaborator experiences a significant problem that could delay or interrupt the supply of product to us, there are very few contract manufacturers who currently have the capability to produce our product candidates. There can be no assurance that manufacturers on whom we depend will be able to successfully produce our products or product candidates on acceptable terms, or on a timely or cost-effective basis, or in accordance with our product specifications and applicable FDA or other governmental regulations. We must have sufficient and acceptable quantities of our product materials to conduct our clinical trials and to market our product candidates, if and when such products have been approved by the FDA for marketing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient and acceptable quantities of our product material, we may be required to delay the clinical testing and marketing of our products, which would negatively impact our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of other companies or product rights that, if not successful, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of other companies, technologies or products. Acquisitions of businesses or product rights involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nour limited experience in evaluating businesses and product opportunities and completing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe use of any existing cash reserves or the need to obtain additional financing to pay for all or a portion of the purchase price of such acquisitions and to support the ongoing operations of the businesses acquired;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to issue convertible debt, equity securities, stock options and stock purchase warrants to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties related to integrating the technology, products, personnel and operations of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nrequirements of significant capital infusions in circumstances under which the acquired business, its products and/or technologies may not generate sufficient revenue or any revenue to offset acquisition costs or ongoing expenses;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no or limited prior direct experience and where competitors have stronger market or intellectual property positions;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our ongoing business, diversion of resources, increases in our expenses and distraction of management\u2019s attention from the normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\nthe potential to negatively impact our results of operations because an acquisition may require us to incur large one-time charges to earnings, amortize or write down amounts related to goodwill and other intangible assets, or incur or assume substantial debt or liabilities, or cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022\nan uncertain sales and earnings stream, or greater than expected liabilities and expenses, associated with the acquired company, product or product rights;\n\u2022\nfailure to operate effectively and efficiently as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our relationships with existing collaborators who could be competitive with the acquired business.\nThere can be no assurance that transactions that we may pursue will ultimately prove successful. If we pursue an acquisition but are not successful in completing it, or if we complete an acquisition but are not successful in integrating the acquired company\u2019s employees, products or operations successfully, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe face intense and increasing competition and must cope with rapid technological change, which may adversely affect our financial condition and/or our ability to successfully commercialize and/or market our products and product candidates.\nOur competitors and potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and medical device companies and more established biotechnology companies. These companies have significantly greater financial and other resources and greater expertise than us in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. This may make it easier for them to respond more quickly than us to new or changing opportunities, technologies or market needs. Our larger competitors may be able to devote greater resources to research and development, marketing, distribution and other activities that could provide them with a competitive advantage. Many of these competitors operate large, well-funded research and development programs and have significant products approved or in development. Small companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical companies or through acquisition or development of intellectual property rights. Our potential competitors also include academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product and clinical development and marketing.\nOur industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent innovations and new product introductions, and evolving industry standards. Existing products and therapies to treat vascular and cardiovascular disease, including drugs and surgical procedures, as well as competitive approaches to wound healing and tissue repair, will compete directly or indirectly with the products that we are seeking to develop and market. In addition, our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization and market penetration than us. As these competitors develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions that prevent us from successfully commercializing our future products. To be successful, we must be able to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually enhancing our products and introducing new products. If we are unable to adapt, products and technologies developed by our competitors may render our products and product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our products and product candidates against competitors. We may never be able to capture and maintain the market share necessary for growth and profitability and there is no guarantee we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.\nChanges and reforms in the health care system or reimbursement policies may adversely affect the sale of our products and future products or our ability to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement or acceptable prices for our products or future products.\nOur ability to earn sufficient returns on our products and future products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for our products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payers. If we fail to obtain appropriate reimbursement, it could prevent us from successfully commercializing and marketing our products and future products.\nThere have been and will continue to be efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means, including limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement. We expect that there will continue to be a number of legislative proposals to implement government controls and other reforms to limit coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, third-party payers, including Medicare, are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services and are limiting the reimbursement levels offered to consumers for these medical products and services. If purchasers or users of our products or future products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for the cost of using the products, they may forego or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products, including gene therapy and other therapeutic products and devices, and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available. The announcement or considerations of these proposals or reforms could impair our ability to raise capital and negatively affect our business.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and advisors, it may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing, pursue collaborations or develop or market our products or product candidates.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific and regulatory personnel and advisors. We currently rely on Christopher J. Reinhard, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer, as our sole executive officer. The loss of Mr. Reinhards\u2019 services would significantly disrupt our operations. We do not maintain any key man life insurance on our executive officers.\nTo pursue our business strategy, we will need to hire or otherwise engage qualified scientific personnel and managers, including personnel with expertise in clinical trials, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and other areas. Competition for qualified personnel is intense among companies, academic institutions and other organizations. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and advisors, it may negatively affect our ability to successfully develop, test, commercialize and market our products and product candidates.\nWe will use hazardous and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur products and processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of certain hazardous and biological materials and waste products. We and our suppliers and other collaborators are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. Even if we and these suppliers and collaborators comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of any insurance we may obtain and exceed our financial resources. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We may incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations.\nTo the extent that we enter markets outside the United States, our business will be subject to political, economic, legal and social risks in those markets, which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are significant regulatory and legal barriers in markets outside the United States that we must overcome to the extent we enter or attempt to enter markets in countries other than the United States. We will be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws, including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws. We also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures, business customs and legal systems. Any sales and operations outside the United States would be subject to political, economic and social uncertainties including, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges and limits in import and export controls;\n\u2022\nincreases in custom duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations and laws;\n\u2022\nabsence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\ncurrency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the United States.\nAny changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect any business operations that we conduct outside the United States.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nIf we do not obtain protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on their intellectual proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nPatents may not be granted from patent applications.\n\u2022\nPatents that have issued or will issue may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage.\n\u2022\nCountries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\n\u2022\nCompetitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate their ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets.\n\u2022\nThere may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if our subsidiaries are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and inventions agreements with employees, scientific advisors, consultants, and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are breached, or that trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events occurs, we otherwise lose protection for their trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nIntellectual property and trade secrets protection are important to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.\nWe may be subject to costly claims, and, if we are unsuccessful in resolving conflicts regarding patent rights, we may be prevented from developing, commercializing or marketing our products and/ or product candidates.\nThere has been, and will likely continue to be, substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. As more potentially competing patent applications are filed, and as more patents are actually issued, in the fields of gene therapy, biologics, collagen-based products, wound healing and tissue repair, adenoviral vectors or in other fields in which we may become involved and with respect to component methods or compositions that we may employ, the risk increases that we or our licensors may be subjected to litigation or other proceedings that claim damages or seek to stop our manufacturing, marketing, product development or commercialization efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our or our licensors\u2019 proprietary rights or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. If we become involved in litigation, it could be costly and divert our efforts and resources. In addition, if any of our competitors file patent applications in the United States claiming technology also invented by us or our licensors, we may need to participate in interference proceedings held by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention and the right to a patent for the technology. Like litigation, interference proceedings can be lengthy and often result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIf we are unsuccessful in defending against any adverse claims, we could be compelled to seek licenses from one or more third parties who could be direct or indirect competitors and who might not make licenses available on terms that we find commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, such proceedings, even if decided in our favor, involve lengthy processes, are subject to appeals, and typically result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nEven if such patent applications or patents are ultimately proven to be invalid, unenforceable or non-infringed, such proceedings are generally expensive and time consuming and could consume a significant portion of our resources and substantially impair our marketing and product development efforts.\nWe may not have adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. To protect our trade secrets, we may enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and potential collaborators. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Likewise, our trade secrets or know-how may become known through other means or be independently discovered by our competitors. Any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur sales and marketing will expose us to product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of biotechnology and medical device products. Failure to obtain or maintain sufficient product liability insurance or otherwise protect against product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization or marketing of our products or product candidates or expose us to substantial liabilities and diversions of resources, all of which can negatively impact our business. Regardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in withdrawal of product candidates from clinical trials, costs of litigation, damage to our reputation, substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs and decreased demand for products.\nProduct liability may result from harm to patients using our products, such as a complication that was either not communicated as a potential side effect or was more extreme than communicated. We will require all patients enrolled in our clinical trials to sign consents, which explain various risks involved with participating in the trial. However, patient consents provide only a limited level of protection, and it may be alleged that the consent did not address or did not adequately address a risk that the patient suffered from. Additionally, we will generally be required to indemnify the clinical product manufacturers, clinical trial centers, medical professionals and other parties conducting related activities in connection with losses they may incur through their involvement in the clinical trials. We may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nThe conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will result in substantial dilution to holders of our common stock.\nOn April 4, 2013, we agreed to issue 4,012 shares of our newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Sabby Healthcare Volatility Master Fund, Ltd. (\u201cSabby\u201d) for $4.0 million in cash. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our common stock. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had an initial conversion price of $0.6437 per share. In addition, the conversion price is subject to downward adjustment if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents at a price less than the then effective conversion price. As long as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, we have also agreed not to incur specified indebtedness without the consent of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. These factors may restrict our ability to raise capital through equity or debt offerings in the future.\nOn July 22, 2015, we entered into an Exchange and Redemption Agreement with Sabby pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the conversion price on the Preferred stock to $0.30 per share. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement granted us a right to redeem any or all of the outstanding Preferred Stock for its Stated Value (approximately $1,000 per share) at any time during a 120 day period after the date of the agreement, and permanently increased the limitation on indebtedness contained in the Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock to allow us to borrow up to $250,000. As a result of the effective conversion price changing from $0.64 to $0.30 per share, the 1,176 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding at July 22, 2015 became convertible into 3,918,667 shares of our common stock, an additional 2,092,350 compared to before the conversion price change. At December 31, 2015, there were 1,041 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding.\nOn September 23, 2016, after the period covered by this report, we entered into a second Exchange and Redemption Agreement with Sabby covering the 1,000 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding at that time. Under the terms of the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, we agreed to reduce the conversion price to $0.18 per share. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement granted us a right to redeem any or all of the outstanding Preferred Stock for its Stated Value (approximately $1,000 per share) at any time after the date of the Agreement until November 29, 2016. We entered into the agreement to increase our options for retiring the outstanding Preferred Stock and financing our continued business operations. As a result of the conversion price changing from $0.30 to $0.18 per share, the 1,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding became convertible to 5,554,667 shares of our common stock, an additional 2,221,867 compared to before the conversion price change. A hypothetical conversion of all of the outstanding Preferred Stock into 3,468,804 common shares would increase the common stock outstanding from 13,187,544 shares as of December 31, 2015, to 16,656,348, an increase of 26%.\nThe exercise of our outstanding warrants and stock options will significantly dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of 8,054,346 stock options and warrants outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $0.19 to $55.00. The exercise of some or all of our outstanding warrants would significantly dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is expected to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could decline substantially in value.\nIn light of our small size, limited resources, and dependence on relatively few products or product candidates, our stock price is expected to be highly volatile and can be subject to substantial drops, with or even in the absence of news affecting our business. The following factors, in addition to the other risk factors described in this report, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other biotechnology and medical device companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in the United States and worldwide;\n\u2022\nanticipated or unanticipated changes in financial condition, operating results or the perceived value of our business;\n\u2022\nanticipated or unanticipated changes that affect our ability to list our common stock on a national exchange;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning any research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing efforts or collaborations;\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations;\n\u2022\nnew products that we or our competitors offer;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, conduct and/or outcome of intellectual property and/or litigation matters;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial or other estimates by securities analysts or other reviewers or evaluators of our business;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales or other transactions involving our common stock; and\n\u2022\nglobal unrest, terrorist activities, and economic and other external factors.\nThe market prices of securities of smaller biotechnology and medical device companies have experienced dramatic fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of the common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of the common stock. Price volatility may be increased if the trading volume of our common stock remains limited or declines.\nOur company could be difficult to acquire due to anti-takeover provisions in our charter, our stockholder rights plan and Delaware law.\nOur bylaws provide for a staggered board of directors and for advanced shareholder notice for actions to be taken at meetings of stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan in which preferred stock purchase rights were distributed as a dividend. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take corporate actions and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. These provisions also could deter or prevent transactions that stockholders deem to be in their interests.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti- takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to specified exceptions, this section provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company. The foregoing factors could reduce the price that investors or an acquirer might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock prohibits us from paying any dividends without the consent of the holders of the preferred stock. In addition any future debt or credit facility we obtain also may preclude or limit our ability to pay any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 84521, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CRXM"}
